hello hello this is going to be
extremely awkward because I've been
Central Park hey what's up you guys so
today I find myself in Central Park
filming a video because I was bored of
my hotel room and I just wanted to get
outside plus it's like it's December
first of all and there's still these
leaves it's beautiful I'm happy I'm out
here I do warn you though there could be
crazy people and crazy things happening
because it's Central Park so let's just
get started and hope I don't die so good
stuff
awesome you guys had a lot of questions
this week and I want to give you a lot
of answers so this week we're doing a
Q&A okay three two one go whoa is New
York York you and I place or something
seems kind of like that apparently have
you been naughty or nice this year
naughty
probably nice let's be real it's me what
is happening with common culture so much
is happening with common culture you
guys you don't know what common culture
is common culture is literally my baby
it is my child I have raised it and it's
growing into a beautiful thing
basically with common culture I'm doing
compilation cop clothes and a lot of
stuff like that is going to be released
this month and next month really I do
not know the timeline for all I know
it's out right now so if it is go just
Connor pop some information on the
screen but all you really need to know
is follow a common culture on Twitter
and Instagram and all that stuff and
that is where I'll be but interrupting
me and that is where I'll be posting all
updates on everything that is coming
culture that brand means so so much to
me haven't spent so much time creating
it and shaping it and it's 100% me and I
just
I love it so go support that if you want
to what's it like traveling so much it's
really really fun to travel a lot but to
be honest it's so exhausting I in time
zones are a crazy type of thing what's
on your Christmas wish list it sounds
really really corny but as I get older I
really don't have anything on my
Christmas list I used to make huge
Christmas lists growing up and like its
slowly but surely gotten shorter as I've
gotten older so not really anything
what part of Christmas are you most
excited for I'm excited for a lot of
things about Christmas this year
I'm truly the most excited though just
to see my family my family every single
one of my family members is gonna be
home for Christmas this year and that
rarely happens nowadays so the fact that
everyone's gonna be home and we're all
gonna pee and healthy and probably
having a great time is more than enough
for me and I'm excited for like the
cookies everyone needs to call mad do
you have any goals to achieve in 2016 I
have so many goals I make so many goals
there's another human watching me the
system great we thought this was a good
idea at me
it was me I am a goal person I love to
make lists and I love to make goals I
have a million different things I want
to do and I'm going to be making that
list at the end of this year so maybe
I'll make like an official video with
kind of my goals for 2016 when it's
actually 2016 but I can't stress enough
how important that is to make lists and
goals it has always helped me and I
can't recommend it enough so go do that
go make a goal sheet and maybe if you
feel comfortable enough tweeted to me
any recent obsession you would like to
tell us about I'll give you a brief I
brought this with you I'll give you a
brief explanation I bought a camera and
it is a fuji film camera and it's like
an actual camera camera specifically for
taking photos basically and i've been so
obsessed with it here are some of the
photos I've taken
that's my recent obsession I need a new
audio book do you have any
recommendations you know I do so for
this week's video like many videos I am

leading provider of audiobooks with over
a hundred and eighty thousand different

Tyler Oakley Tyler's one of my good
friends and I have yet to listen to his
book but it is literally next on my list

tickets have you gotten in your whole
life
I have been pulled over twice by the
police while operating a motor vehicle
and one time I have gotten a ticket and
it was probably one of the scariest
things in my entire life I won't tell
you much but I may have cried how often
do you wash your hair I don't wash my
hair that much I shower every day but I
use conditioner on my hair pretty much
every day someone once told me that
shampooing is really really bad for your
hair so being really really dumb I did
not actually look that backed up and I
just started using conditioner instead
Gomi awesome Google's the thing remember
that how do I stop making typos I
honestly cannot tell you I just tend to
get very excited when I'm like tweeting
things or texting things and I just
send it really quickly and make a
million typos and haven't like looked it
over and it's just a flaw and my being
and I can't seem to fix it so Helen
sorry I have no recommendation just slow
down maybe that's my only recognition we
got a helicopter people they found me
okay now for a quick bonus five
questions Brown back in September I had
my birthday campaign with prize EO and
five you guys donated enough to get a
Q&A questions without further ado here
are those five people Corina Zhang wants
to know have I ever considered coming to
China I have I really really really want
to visit pretty much everywhere in the
world and China is no different I feel
like the culture there is so completely
different from what I experience in
America and I would really love to
experience it one day Tiffany Zimmerman
wants to know what's the most
embarrassing thing that's ever happened
to you and I need to check my iPhone
because I randomly remembered the most
embarrassing thing that's ever happened
to me like the other night and I wrote
it down so let me look give me a sec ooh
embarrassing moment that is what it's on
there so a most embarrassing or one of
my most embarrassing moments I have many
I was in school one day and I had a
YouTube channel I had this YouTube
channel and I was like I just uploaded a
video I think you know that day or the
day before and I was checking to see
like the comments and how it was doing
and I pulled out my phone during like
this was a college lecture like it was
like 15 kids and a professor and they
were learning all that smart people
stuff and I pulled out my phone and the
video started playing really loudly and
everyone looked at me and it was my
voice so it was really confusing that I
was like hey what's up you guys it's
Connor and I just like got immediately
read and like hit my phone cuz I had no
idea how to like turn off the video and
then just put in my pocket and continue
to like look down throughout the rest of
class it was very embarrassing and I
bolted out there as soon as I could
utter humiliation Jared Lambert wants to
know do you ever make your way up to
Central Coast of California I actually
for being in California almost three
years I have never liked driven up the
coast or gone on like a real road trip
so I have not but I really really want
to I feel like driving up the entire
coast of California would be an amazing
so I should do that one day Matt Ratliff
wants to know was there anyone that you
looked up there suppose was there anyone
you looked up to that influenced your
perspectives and completely influenced
who you are today the easy and kind of
obvious answer is just my family and my
parents specifically my parents are
really really good people and they're
really kind they have a really good work
ethic my mom has instilled so many life
lessons to me whether it's manners or
how to be organized my dad is incredibly
intelligent he's always been the type of
guy that knows how to work hard but also
play hard and he's incredibly goofy yeah
they have totally shaped Who I am today
and I can't thank them enough for that
and finally Daniel Ross wants to know
what's one place you've never visited
but you want to go to I again I really
want to go to so many places in the
world I have yet to be to anywhere in
South America so probably somewhere
there but also Scandinavia in general
would be amazing I went to Sweden just a
couple weeks ago and it was so beautiful
I really just want to go to places that
are beautiful and have beautiful people
