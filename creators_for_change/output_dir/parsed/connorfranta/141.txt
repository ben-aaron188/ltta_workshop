hey what's up you guys look I'm in a
hotel room also look I'm wearing a
bright color things that well the first
one happens a lot this one never happens
I'm the type of person that wears black
clothing pretty much every day this is a
nice change of pace or a nice change of
clothes never really got that reference
but does that even mean okay but this
video is brought to you from Orlando
Florida on my book tour one of the many
stops and now we're gonna cut to Connor
outside Connor what is the weather like
hello Connor today we are brought to you
from the parking lots and it's windy and
humid and the camera is probably out of
focus and I also just found my
microphone that kind of scared me good
times here in Orlando Florida back to
you Connor
yes yes that very much that but yes
everyone so as you know over the past
well like couple weeks like three or
four weeks I've been doing to err type
thing between amplify tour and book tour
I have met thousands of you guys
thousands and thousands of people like
hard to fathom this book tour alone I'm
meeting like around 1200 to 1600 people
a city a night that's a lot of people
also that's a lot of awkward that's a
lot of awkward so sometimes I tend to be
very awkward with people like and I'm
not generally a very awkward person I
just like after meeting a lot of people
it just comes out the awkwardness just
kind of seeps through my being yeah like
let me give you some examples
I am the or Swift names and with this
tour I meet a lot of people and they
tell me their names and it goes
something a little bit like this hi I'm
Katherine nice to meet you I'm Connor
okay bye what a nice Katie
Kaitlyn Kevin I forget people's names I
swear to God in like two seconds I don't
know what it is but I have the absolute
worst like as soon as that it's like it
goes over my head over my head within
seconds I just don't remember people's
names I think it's like I have it I'm
into where I just don't know to
remembers people I think it's just a
habit that I'm in that I just don't know
how to remember people's names I
to get better at that also what comes
with meeting people is greetings okay so
with the book tour it's pretty obvious
that most of the time I hope people but
in general with life there's those
awkward times where you're like I don't
know if I should shake this person's
hand should I hug them I don't know
maybe they hate people so with girls I'm
like they probably won't freak out if I
hug them so I hug them but with guys
it's awkward like this hand is here and
this hand is there cuz I'm like well if
they come in for the hug I can swoop but
if they're for the handshake I can be
like an itch and shake I don't know and
half the time is fine but other half the
times it's super awkward and I have to
be like hi I'm a hugger I'm from
Minnesota we hug what we do there
everyone hugs literally everyone think
I'm sick my battery light is already
flashing great another thing that comes
with hugs is when you go in for the hug
I never know where to look so a lot of
times we'll both go to the same side and
then we'll be like almost making out
cool cool love making out with strangers
very unsanitary very illegal so yeah if
I ever meet you and we like almost make
out I'm sorry about that that happens
sometimes get it over man what am I even
talking about the light is fading the
light is always fading stay up shy call
someone and see what happens I'm gonna
call someone what I want to so I have on
the list
oh quick before I do that another thing
that happens is when I talk to people a
lot of times the conversations don't
make sense I'll be like hey what's your
name and then the person will respond
good and then they'll say what's up and
I'll say hello and just we did the
conversing can be hard sometimes under
stressful situations yep okay let me
call room service is there a
speakerphone option there's not a
speakerphone option there's no
speakerphone option we're screwed let's
pretend I didn't prank call I don't know
um back to Conor with the weather we got
in trouble this time Conor we are on the
move back to you Conor back to you
gonna save the show let's do a back flip
okay but yeah I
I don't know what this video
accomplished will I upload this are to
tell long story short I'm having a
really great time on my book tour not
gonna lie it's been honestly so fun

video is a little lackluster but it'll
be better next week I'll be done with
