so the other day it's cleaning the
dishes and I cut my finger safe to say
I'm never doing that again
hey what's up you guys so I decided I
haven't done a Q&A in quite a while you
guys always have so many questions for
me so I need to give you some answers so
for this Q&A I decided to take it to
tumblr and sub to Twitter
no offense Twitter but Tumblr's a little
bit better so if you're not following me
on tumblr you're missing out
just saying let's get right into it what
would you say is the most important
thing in life having a good tumblr blog
duh why is your tumblr so hipster why is
your tumblr so irrelevant I'm kidding
I'm kidding
don't be a hater dear what is the last
picture under camera roll Oh God let me
see this could be interesting
Oh yep it's born food porn oh yeah look
at it what do you use to take and edit
your photos they're all really cool
first off thank you uh can I use my
iPhone to take all my photos and I use
afterlight to edit them that's $0.99
I've ever spent if you could be a
different person for every day of the
week who would you want to be let's see
here
me myself myself again me me
Zac Efron and then myself wearing a hat
if you were stuck in a room full of
spiders would you cry or would you cry
have you ever kissed a youtuber mm-hmm
well how many youtubers have you dated
God what's like the weirdest food you've
ever eaten clams because you're
literally taking a rock-like object that
has been at the bottom of the ocean for
its entire life and then you're sucking
out its insides pretty weird do you
believe in Hakuna Matata make up a
freestyle rap starting now go oh

getting red because I can't rap get me a
hat to cover my face cuz I'm a disgrace

pitbull do you think I'll ever get a
chance to meet you hopefully you get
stressed out really easily
unfortunately what would you do if you
were invisible for a day touch your butt

the creepiest thing I've ever said quick

I need a little bit of time to practice
winds like your expiration date never
