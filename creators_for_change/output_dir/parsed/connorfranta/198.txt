seriously play with my hair way too much
it's the typhoon over because the last
couple days have been crazy sassy
hey what's up you guys so today I am
back in my room but I never left I guess
on this channel I was in Hawaii
fun fact maybe I'll tell you more about
that in a different video I don't know a
dildo I don't know okay so if you guys
do not know the past couple days in the
West Side coast have been pretty frickin
crazy there's been some insane weather
like it has been pouring for three days
straight and it doesn't do that here I
don't think I've barely seen a drop of
water fall from the sky let alone like
six inches of it it doesn't rain here I
don't know I don't know how that's
possible
but it doesn't but either way so the
other morning I was woken up by this
really loud storm at like 7:30 so it was
past the point of being nice and calming
but then I got really scared cuz it was
really really loud and I was like I'm on
a hill what if my house falls off is
that even possible
I don't know but my mind jumped to that
conclusion and I got I got really scared
I'm gonna be real here I was scared but
basically that's what sparked this video
idea so this week I will be talking
about jumping to conclusions here we go
my mind does this all the time you you
do this to me I bite you if I could I
don't get it something little will
happen I'm just like oh my god the
world's gonna end I've noticed this with
a lot of my friends - a lot of my family
a lot of everyone I know everyone just
seems to jump to crazy conclusions first
example the storm last night in what
world does my mind immediately think
it's raining my house is gonna fall off
a hill I don't know I do not know
oh is it raining he never does that here
oh my god
thank Connor what do you do what do you
do what about that one time that your
friend told you that their house fall
off a hill no that's stupid or is it oh
my god I'm a wuss another time this
happens to me is what I hear about like
a car accident or something bad that
happened my mind build me to be like oh
my god I know the person in that
accident
I immediately him just like I need to
call all my friends and family I need to
make sure they're okay I don't care if
they're watching movie on care if
they're pooping I need to call them just
to make sure my hand is shaking look at
it hello what is wrong with you know him
again hey sweetie oh hey mom it's me
again
you know just checking in to see how you
are how your days been going are you
still breathing
are you still breathing mom honey I'm um
taking a shit I'm taking a shit okay
that's all I needed to know I love you
goodbye I love you too and think you're
crazy anytime any part of my body feels
pain or I feel sick or I just don't feel
right
I'm dying you're dying we're all dying
doesn't that freak you out freaks me out
a little bit you'd think with that dad
that's a doctor I wouldn't be worried
about this but he's basically my
personal hotline so me call dr. Pratt
with all your problems dad my toe hurts
fix it my toe is throbbing amputated
just amputated I can do this I know what
has to be done uh-huh yeah you go I
think it's gone Oh anytime someone calls
me out of the blue that doesn't normally
call me or even like my parents when
they call me I just think oh my god why
is this person calling me this isn't
2010 tweet me text me don't Facebook me
I don't look at that my mind jumps at
this crazy conclusion they're pissed
they are pissed at me and I'm about to
feel the wrath
Oh our Garr what if she looked under my
bed had finally found the mass amounts
of her husband's I got it for her
birthday what if she doesn't like them
all right hmm
somebody hold me when you text someone
and they don't respond right away I
freaked the fuck out I need to realize
that people have lives and aren't always
looking at their phones the world does
not revolve around me my texts can wait
but I don't get it yet I don't
understand that time in between sending
your message and receiving a reply is
just of one big emotional breakdown
mental physical all the breakdowns
happens I'm gonna text my crush I love
you very subtle
son and now we wait too much response
from my mom I hate you goddamnit
all right now if you're in a
relationship and the person you're with
says they happen to have met someone
nice today
on the outside you're like oh that's
cool but on the inside you're like what
is their name where did you meet them
who are they where are they from and why
are you cheating on me hey honey guess
what I've met some new people today and
they were so awesome oh you did well I
will end them oh I will end them um
please don't do that hmm that's right
that person you don't want to be that
person and finally the phrase we need to
talk I think no matter what whether
you're in a relationship or not if you
hear those words you're like why why
would you phrase it like that how bad is
it what did I do
I didn't need to I can we fix it I your
mind goes to we're breaking up our
friendship is over oh my god babe yeah
we need to talk about how amazing and
beautiful and perfect I am uh no no it's
definitely about how amazing beautiful
and perfect I am
my god she's insane I'm awesome but yeah
I tend to jump to a lot of conclusions
we all get a little crazy sometimes we
want to think the worst before we think
the best but not positivity optimism
have some peace of mind people but yes
that's all we got to say but I want to
know what you guys have to say so leave
a comment below at some of the
situations that you tend to jump to
conclusions on other than that make sure
this video big one of these follow me on
all my social media links by conclusions
I'm a joke to them whole
