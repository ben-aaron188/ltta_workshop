hey what's up you guys it's Connor and
this week I'm gonna be talking about
some of my firsts basically a bunch of
first times I did things that's not a
bunch of other youtubers doing this so I
thought it'd be really cool for me to do
myself so here we go first word okay so
I just called my mom about this and she
said my first word at 10 months old was
daddy and use she said I used to always
say use if I wanted juice to drink Y
first best friend again this is another
thing had to call for my mom and she
said my first best friend was this kid
named Tanner and I do remember Tanner
but I have no idea like where he is now
and what he's doing you forget about
people first pet okay so besides like
fish and stuff my first real pet was a
white rabbit named snowy extremely
original name I know very creative child
and actually fun facts no he was a
litter trained rabbit so he was like hop
around our house and then poop in his
litter no he was pretty cool first fear
okay so I thought this one was really
weird but my first fear and even still
today a little bit it's a fear of the
dark so as much as I love like nighttime
and stuff I used to be terrified of the
dark and every time like I go to bed and
my mom would trap the light I would just
be terrifying I don't know why but what
it was and still today what the dark is
so creepy like if you're alone at home
and you have to go downstairs and all
the lights are off it still creeps me
out first person I texted today so it
wasn't just one person it was a group
chat I have a group chat with like 9
other youtubers and but it's always just
constantly texting each other so I'm
pretty straight texted that first this
morning first car the first and only car
I've ever had is a Honda CRV my dad has
this weird obsession with Honda vehicles
so we have I think we've had five Honda
CRVs in my lifetime I don't even know
but it's a really good car and I still
love my Honda CRV first cellphone so
when I got a cell phone for the first
time it was a ninth grade second
semester I was one of those cool kids
with the flip razors flip phones were
the I'm pretty sure I had a limit
of like 150 text messages so I mean I
had a nice pairing on who I was talking
to
got 15 text messages left I have only
not the time for this sass boom now
we're getting to the juicy questions
first date I ever went on so I'm pretty
sure the first legit date I went on was
in seventh grade it was with this girl
named Carly and I'm pretty sure we just
went to a school dance but you know that
was a big deal back then okay you know I
was freaking nervous little Connor was
sweating and prepubescent and just
freaking out first girlfriend it just so
happens that my first girlfriend was
also Carly thank you ciao it was a
pretty long and not awkward at all
relationship and I totally didn't just
lie to you right now no it was a typical
first relationship it was just pretty
awkward and just kind of like didn't
really count first kiss so my first kiss
was actually in ninth grade or at least
the first kiss I remember I don't know I
maybe I was a when I was younger so
the first kiss I remember was really
just again awkward I was in ninth grade
and my girlfriend the time the Tasha we
were in the school hallway and I was
about to go home and we were both
standing in the hallways Hawking and I
like saw my mom pull up I'm like I'm
gonna do it now just like leaned in
Chester was like bye and then okay so it
was just literally like really quick was
just like a quick attack and like that
run I don't know I went to a private
school I was a little Saint I had no
idea what that was first love I don't
think I've actually been in love with
anyone yet is that a good or bad thing I
don't really know so I'm gonna say my
parents and my family first youtube
video okay so my first youtube video is
so again I'm gonna use the word awkward
it was titled no subscribers and I
basically just talked about how is
making my first youtube video I'll play
a little clip of it right there just
know just know so bad it's on private
now along with like half of my videos I
can't
my first big purchase my first big
purchase though would have to be my
macbook where is it it's right here I
bought a MacBook sometime back I think
like freshman year sophomore year of
high school that was the first time I'd
spent probably more than a couple
hundred dollars so it was a big deal in
my life okay when I fell in love with
the Internet we're in love don't
understand first job so the first and
only Java technically ever had was a
lifeguard I was a lifeguard from eighth
grade until last year so it's been about
five or six years and it was a great
mixture between work and play because
being a lifeguard it's just like you
have to sit there but at the same time
you have to be watching and saving
people's lives so it was a pretty cool
job it was pretty interesting and fun
fact I saved two people's lives while I
had that job first time out of the
country
the first time I was ever out of the
country is when I flew to the Virgin
Islands for a family vacation and when I
came back it was just called the island
but really that's all the firsts I have

a little bit more about me and you did
