sorry about it I like Instagram stories
better what is your blood type I came
into that can I answer that do you think
children should be sheltered from
unhappiness what the fuck what kind of
questions are these yeah no everyone
should experience happiness and
unhappiness what kind of questions if
you can have one of your five senses
taken away which one would you pick Oh
God um me thank hearing music taste food
eyes sight definitely not eyes touch
feeling what am I missing here some
smell oh my god this is difficult um my
first thought says sense of smell so I'm
gonna go sense of smell sometimes I do
these things and I think they're real
like I feel like that answer now has to
happen I would you rather accidentally
get stabbed or run over by a car
neither but if I had to pick I guess
stabbed because it's like one wound
versus run over a cars like a million
wounds what kind of questions how do you
