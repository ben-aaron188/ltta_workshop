meet-and-greet for Urban Outfitters big
day fun day yeah I'm just gonna take you
guys with me how do people daily vlog

vlogging is when you can respond somehow
immediately that's a live stream I'm an
idiot

Tower but you see the cloud wolf dude

after having 20 40 there you go
hi great to see who had suspenders on
makes it traffic literally came back to
my hotel for no reason it was like an
awkward amount of time where I had like
an hour and I could go somewhere that I
need to be and be there like 40 minutes
early or I go here and then walk to that
place and be there on time I'm kind of
happy about that because I didn't
exercise this morning and I'm the type
of person that needs to exercise every
day otherwise I just feel like sluggish
so I'm gonna go for a 30-minute walk oh
oh also I completely forgot to tell you
that the people interview thing went
well I get so nervous for those things
that I don't know why I'm always like
super shaky as soon as the camera turns
on and then as soon as it's off I'm like
I'm back to normal I shouldn't be camera
shy like it's I give zero fucks but I
got a lot of chill in me it's freezing
outside I will say if I do pride myself
on one thing it's that I'm a really fast
Walker

supposed to meet didn't show up I feel
like I got stood up on a first date but
