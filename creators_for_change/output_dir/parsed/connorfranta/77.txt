I just have all the things on my mind
lately I've been incredibly busy which
is everyone's favorite thing to say
doing all the things seeing all the
things I literally haven't seen a human
today actually this is like the first
time I'm talking this is weird I'm just
noticing this today with the VA that's
Connor this week I did not feel like
doing anything besides just talking and
painting my nails so that's what I'm
gonna do I'm going to paint my nails I'm
just going to talk about whatever I feel
like talking about so you if you want to
listen let's go for it
I'm terrified that I'm going to spill
this everywhere I've only painted my
nails maybe a dozen time so bear with me
it's not as easy as it looks I don't
care what anyone says this is a skill I
need I'm still trying to learn it that
looks that looks decent I went with this
oh my god I'm such a guru Oh goo I went
with this hunter green color because I'm
wearing hunter green and because Kevin
is hunter green this one's for you Kevin
shout out to Kevin share I've been
seeing a lot of movies lately one that
everyone was talking about one that I
was super excited to see was Suicide
Squad
that has jared leto and a bunch of other
humans and i had high expectations i saw
the trailer like what a year ago i
fucking hate that movies can do that
that they can put out their trailers a
year early because I am so impatient but
so I had really high expectations of
this this is coming along nicely and it
didn't live up to it I hate to be the
bearer of bad news but it really wasn't
a good movie I'm how do I say this
without offending anybody it had great
intentions the acting was amazing or
maybe not amazing but like really really
good all of the the costumes and the
scenes and everything looked great it
was just edited so weird like if you've
seen the film it just it's so jumpy and
it's almost no shade towards me but it's
like a YouTube video it just kind of
jumps all over and just makes sense
okay shade towards me yeah so it was fun
but not amazing another movie though I
thought I saw was I love fun fact about
me I love scary movies so I saw this
film that is out it's called lights out
and holy shit it is terrifying I it had
me so little backstory so I wanted to
see this movie but I was starving so me
and my friends went to this movie and we
snuck in our dinner so I legit snuck in
a giant salad into this movie and was
sitting there crunching on my salad the
whole movie I felt bad because it was
like loud but I snuck a whole dinner
into a movie dinner and a movie
how amazing and I also wore a hoodie and
sweats to it and was like I put up my
hood and I was like terrified the whole
time so it was so scary but yeah it was
like terrifying and the most amazing
part about it is I think they made it
for like two or three million dollars
which is a tiny amount of money for a
movie so that's really commendable it's
really I love when people do things that
people don't expect do I dare start on
the second hand this is going to be I'm
always so bad because I'm right-handed
I'm not what is it em ambidextrous I'm
struggling with the words so this is
difficult this hand is oh I already done
fucked up anyway how are you supposed to
talk and paint at the same time what am
i some sort of mother my mom can do like
50 things at the same time she is a
high-class woman isn't a really stupid
how finger paint is classified as a
female product I think it's literally
paint for your fingers if I went to the
store and bought house paint like paint
that you paint on a wall and put on my
fingers is that more manly of me
everything is stupid everything is
stupid I would love to live in a society
one day where products are not gendered
and you just walk into a clothing store
and you just kind of buy whatever you
want
nothing's categorized you just figure it
out my pinky looks so bad so bad I
bought clothes from this Korean brand I
don't even remember the name of it to be
honest but that's how they're doing it
the clothes have no gender so they have
one size which is that's unrealistic in
my opinion it's one size and unisex
which I thought just was like
interesting I got a t-shirt and it did
not fit me but it look soup every time I
do this I always wanted to touch things
when my hands are wet sand that just
doesn't work with this
I got this t-shirt on the vintage store
and I realized as I was putting it on
one of the armpits has like a permanent
stain that's disgusting now that I'm
verbally saying that it was $10 I've
been working on a lot I know you hate
when I do I'm gonna put on a second coat
I've been working on a lot of secret
projects that I cannot wait for you guys
to see I've literally even wait waiting
working on them for months months months
months months months one huge one in
particular that I'm like genuinely super
thrilled about and I know you guys are
really gonna love it it's always so hard
working on things in secret because no
one knows you're doing them like it just
looks like you're lazy it looks like
you're doing nothing but you're secretly
like working your fucking ass off I've
been swearing so much in this video my
mom is gonna call me I've also been
playing as has the world been playing
Pokemon go lately and I caught a dragon
at the other night jealous I also
evolved my my call oh god I really like
Pokemon I'm not a poser my growlithe
into a arcanine it's like the cutest
thing in the world I remember growing up
that I wanted Pokemon to be real so
badly like so like to the point of Tears
I was like I want this dog to be my dog
or I want this dragon to fly me to
school and paint my thumb I don't think
I've handed my thumb yet this is looking
great I'm this is not might be my best
work yet no wait I did paint it did I
paint it already I don't know if I did

and then I pick it off but it's really
helped me stop biting my nails every
time I take off the who knows of its led
based paint my name is just feel longer

around the block because I wanted to

was just playing that song with my
windows down driving around the block
screaming belting all of the lyrics that
I have yet to learn I missed that one up

think that I was going to go to the
Olympics I was so deeply involved in
swimming that I thought I would make it
the Olympics

that's hard but I've been watching the
Olympics and it's been really fun and oh
god everyone is just so damn attractive

superpowers and they can just jump and
do flips like it looks that easy the
human anatomy and capabilities okay
