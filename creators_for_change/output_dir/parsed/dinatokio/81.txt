Leigh Hearon any Deveny
everywhere else name a guy so um she's
just gone in the shop to take my Mac
bookings for repairing basically because
planning to save some a lot of things on
then in Sean Maher we can but anyway
gesture to see have finally uploaded her
second vid on youtube the first one was
the Q&A i did with her just to help her
get side she's finally done a second
video and it's another Q&A but this time
is with a husband penny and anyway start
talking about it sama phobia and white
privilege in the video and i just
thought i'd comment on it because it's
something that music is spoken on I
don't know a shot member how many times
or how briefly or how not briefly before
but something that we as a family talk
about that because there's a lot of
people not understanding in the comments
and they're all why people get offended
by being told that they have white
privilege which is really stupid
how long since backs it because it's not
an offense it's not a label it's about
why producing it is
it's a thing it's a fact it's a factual
thing it's a thing that happens in
society it's a thing it's not like if I
say you've got white privilege oh I have
white privilege because I do because I'm
halfway it's not like a personal thing
it's not it's not an offensive thing to
say it's a thing it's just like think
there's racism in this world it's a fact
that that's something that happens you
know to see and Perry are talking about
how you know Perry has white privilege
you know he can walk out the door and be
seen as a normal person normal white man
he doesn't mention well because that
society's society sees white as normal
this is what white privileges which is
what I want to get you suppose racking
my brains trying to figure out how to
explain this to people because it's
literally some people take it personally
because it's not to do with poverty not
to say that why people don't go through
struggle is to say that the white race
is seen as the norm whereas every other
race is not seen as the norm to get me
that's the privilege and obviously with
being seen as normal and comes many many
benefits that they will never ever see
or realize unless they can change their
age which we can't or unless they look
visibly like for example me to see
because we wear scars we look visibly
different and what I was the want to say
it means you see a half white half
Egyptian quite clearly we have light
skin we have my skin color but we look
different because we wear scarf doing
that that obviously we get seen as seen
differently but we also have privileges
white privilege is compared to let's say
a black Chevy to get me privileges for
being white within artists and
communities within lots and lots of
different things as well so it's not
just like a the cookie she's in a scarf
do she also has privileges but they'll
be different there'll be you know
there'll be everybody have different
depends on your context and everything
but for example to see is a
light-skinned me and TCR light-skinned
hijab you girls will also have white I
can imagine if I was a lot darker I
would experience I would experience life
slightly differently I was reading to
the comments and somebody somebody did a
really nice short straight-to-the-point
comment explaining what it is for the
people who don't understand I thought
I'd read out because
actually that's why I'm just the one to
say but they said it great and this is
from something called internet for an
internet freak and then the term white
privilege is basically not being seen as
different it's not a way of saying white
people don't suffer through life or so
or suffer poverty etc it's simply saying
that you are not seen as someone
different every race that's not white is
always labeled white race is never a
label it's considered the norm you are
privileged for that means that we're
talking about even in the Asian
community if there's a light-skinned
girl like skin Asian girl compared to a
dark-skinned asian girl not it's not
just asian community even the Arab
Beauty freaking everywhere man black
communities if you're light-skinned in
any other race you are seen as more
beautiful and some people get confused
and be like well that's not white
privilege that's just like a cultural
gobbler is white privilege because
whites and being white is seen as the
norm and a student seen as beautiful and
so other cultures and races want that so
it's white privilege because the girl
who looks more white gets treated bare
to get me I just wish they would just
wouldn't go over the head I wouldn't go
through it and that's all white people
who don't understand what white
privilege is and not just white people
that also to all people just people who
don't understand it because even if
you're Asian but you are fair and you
are light skin you have privileges
within your community you even have
privileges out and about because you
look more familiar to the norm you get
me society sees you in a better light
thank you is that better than they would
for a person who was in the same say a
person who had the same status had the
same amount of money you have had the
same current life cetera but they were a
person of color you would have it better
I love my white homies I love white
people I love my white yeah I'm your
right eye I love you alright I'm not a
why here okay you know my daughter's go
away I'm not white here I just I just
dislike I really really dislike it
an ignorant white people that really
does my head back in IKEA second home
kids have enough 5e so um over the last
20 minutes there was a huge big argument
in our V campaign there's a big argument
about it nothing more not like the guy
was about her not someone else
and I'm like it was basically about is
about not being served the one side of
the country had clothes called
serving which is finished but the guys
came thought that he was not being
served because he's black so he it's not
is it
I guess it did look like that I did look
like that suddenly all sudden guys in
the back home my battery died Makia I
know I told you in last week's vlog that
I'll show you a bedroom situation you're
going to be disgusted and disappointed
in me are you asked me ready for it okay
