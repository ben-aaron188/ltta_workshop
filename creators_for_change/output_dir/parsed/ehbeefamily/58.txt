ya id rather be a lover than a fighter
cause all my life i've been fighting
and i've never felt the feeling of comfort
all this time iv'e been hiding
And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah
I'm so used to sharing
Love only left me alone
But I'm at one with the silence
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one
and I've been quiet for too long
 
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying. I'm at one
and I've been silent for too long
 
 
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one
and I've been quiet for too long
 
I'm in need of a savior, but i'm not asking for favors
My whole life, I've felt like a burden
I think too much, and I hate it
I'm so used to being in the wrong,
I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home
so I'll sit here in the silence
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been
quiet for too long
 
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one
and I've been silent for too long
 
 
 
 
 
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one
and I've been quiet for too long
 
Thanks for watching!
