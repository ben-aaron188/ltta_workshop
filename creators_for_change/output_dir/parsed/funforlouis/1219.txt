hi I'm Barda and Ambala and you are
watching fatherly well this morning
we're jumping in a taxi down to the
marina we're going to get our sailing
boats very early
as if I'm feeling well we've just had
our team briefing and we've met the
other people that come in on their boat
with us
Fayetteville and Steve excited check out
our bait this is crazy
so we've been going for a few hours
and these are buttons that we're going
to be sleeping tonight
fuck
it's pretty rockin here this is a bit
choppy
the toilet and shower I don't know the
shower is lips on the showers pilots
happy from now we've got the kitchen
area I think I cooking some quiches or
feet
and we're spending two days on this boat
I've just checked and got no phone
signal which means the Internet box I
brought probably won't work neither it
probably means you guys won't be seeing
this
When You're Expecting it's probably a
mirror a day later
lunch time the first bite low they've
gone to shore got with cats money little
dinghy to shore because we're moored out
here
and now we're heading in we're going to
go to a nice suspenders walk on one of
the Whitsunday islands I don't know
really where they are
so I always do what had to be something
right we're walking to the lookout point
and someone just told us there's a
massive spider check how big this spider
is this is crazy big as my hand
we're tracking to the next lookout point
and then I think eventually we're going
to go down and chill on the beach for a
bit this is awesome you enjoying it
Steve
amazing so good in it haven't have all
about the big spiders stuff ray too much
well now it's pretty magical we all
ended up falling asleep in the beach for
an hour or so and I got to see some
stingray
I was following those around them the
shallow waters for a little bit but it
definitely does live up to his name as
being one of the most beautiful beaches
in the world
pure white sand and just stunning views
just beautiful stunning views if you
ever get a chance to visit wits and the
islands I definitely recommend it and
now I'm trekking back through this
little jungle path back to the sailboat
we're going to get a little dinghy back
to the sailboat and continue towards the
reef I guess we're going to be doing
some snorkeling and potentially some
scuba diving there tomorrow I'm super
happy it's so good we are the only
sailboat left in the bay Wow
take us away captain Tony going out
just go back on the ship and there are
not trees waiting for us this is amazing
natural tan
so we found a cheer little bait to dock
up into the night
so we had a bit of a headache all right
luckily none of us lose it
look how short this is a school we just
get our dinner and result in two ways
this reggaeton is spaghetti bolognaise
oh she's always a favourite bit of a
treat and I caught fresh on the boat
well this is very romantic isn't it
doing the washing-up wishy washy weird
selling down the night and it's pretty
warm here it's true warm but we're going
to sleep well and we've heard there is
scuba dive tomorrow which I'm pretty
excited about so attached to that peace
out enjoy life a little bit Mitch
