so I just woke up for the most beautiful
entry into Budapest and Hungary we just
came over this bridge and it's just like
amazing that's amazing I slept very well
and we are on our ways and it's
incredible spa it's like a thermal hot
water spa with saunas and massage hello
Stevie
so this Budapest spies in this like
Roman bathhouse style building this
we've got a little coffee and we're
about to go around the rapids with our
coffees all this is hot water
this is hot water oh wait you're saying
lads shit cheers Cheers let's go for a
little journey around the rapids
Compeyson yeah it's another you
oh it's a hard life in it I could just
do this all this guy's angry by your
finger out then no coffee in the book
this guy's angry angry no coffee
okay sorry man we just
we're walking around trying to find
where the mad soldiers ever lost my came
here I got a strong Hungarian man and
that's not my back and that's amazing
it's time to massage get in there Dave
I got wrestled down to the ground by a
big grizzly man and I liked it I was
good thought about that sauce but I fell
asleep actually if it sees the different
asleep at night I fell asleep like five
minutes ago one couples I can't sleep Oh
- ow my knee over my head
I was an incredible morning of bliss
relaxation and maybe a little bit of
pain for some people
they've got battered by a masseuse and
now we're going for some lunch
we're in another fancy hotel with fast
Wi-Fi quoi fee we get it's a lunch what
you feel it for lunch Dave please Nick
just point out we've got little swords
with our top sandwich and God mix in the
driver's seat and I've got that friend
and 90 miles until we get to the steerer
in Romania which is where we're going we
don't even know whether we've got
somewhere to sleep when we get there
we're gonna get there about three or
four in the morning so
something I enjoy about road trips the
most it's just having really deep
conversations with people because you're
sitting in a vehicle with them for hours
upon hours and then you end up just
chatting about life and everything and
just being chat to Nick for like two
hours about influencing the world and
encouraging people and stuff like that
and it's it's cool it's cool so a few
weeks ago we interviewed a whole bunch
of you guys from there to find the
nomads competition and the interesting
thing that we found is that a whole lot
of you learn Louie's lifestyle and but I
think there was a kind of a
discontentment or like there's a
question about how you guys can make it
happen for yourselves how you guys can
make your ideas have so with my videos
my office I'm showing you my life and
I'm really loving what I'm doing right
now I'm aware that you open up watching
me loving my life and traveling and
stuff of that but maybe you want to do
other things but aren't sure how did it
ways
so holla you guys probably have your own
dreams and desires and goals you own
plan for your own life but you're not a
hundred percent sure about how to make
that happen for yourself
so maybe maybe not so kind of what I
want to do is through the channel is to
give you some practical advice and tips
about how you guys can make your your
own ideas happen so if you want to check
out some of the next videos I'm gonna
join them on that journey I think it
could be really cool for you guys
especially those of you that feel a
little bit lost in life right now
it's 8:30 and it's time for some food
and we saw our mechnimals and we could
not help ourselves look at this guy
looks like Dave with a moustache
how did you help beating going Steve
there's no other options I know I'm
really excited guys I've just been on
the internet and I just found out that
overtaking food for the lead with this
channel plan flurry which I've been
wanting to do for like a year and it's
finally happened and it's a big part of
redefining myself on YouTube and it's a
big moment it's a big moment I'm really
excited I wanted to thank you guys for
being on the journey with me with fun
fillory and subscribing and following
the videos and stuff it's it's been
awesome and there's many more adventures
to come including driving into Romania
which is going to be in about an hour so
I'm gonna carry on my driving shift Nick
Steel Co coiling and me and Steve and
Dave are cuddling in the back they're
getting some rest before they do their
little driving shift
we are entering Romania hopefully
hopefully we can enter Romania fucking
okay so they're being a bit iffy about
mix possible not having a specific
Romanian visa in it so hopefully they
let commit the maximum period of say
it's five days so with a South African
visa you can't you can't stay here
longer than five days if you have a
Schengen visa so I'm basically checking
out of here within about this which is
the truth
cool legit legit that's good we got you
into a high-five boom we successfully
got into Romania me and Nick have done
our share of the driving Steve and Dave
are taking over we're gonna get some
sleep tomorrow we're gonna meet up with
the rest of the teams that are in
Christie Roo which is the town which
we're staying in and then we're gonna
visit this gypsy village give them some
stuff that we brought maybe leave Rodney
that's the name we decided on Rodney
maybe leave him there this vehicle or I
do love Rodney so much we're thinking
minik thinking of maybe instead of
flying back driving Rodney back what do
you go Europe what do you guys think
Ford reckon yeah yeah anyway we're gonna
get some sleep
peace out enjoy life and live adventure
