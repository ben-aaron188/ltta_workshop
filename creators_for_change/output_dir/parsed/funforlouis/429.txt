good morning guys
today as our last full day in the
Maldives and it's been one of the best
trips I've ever done relaxation and just
sheer amazement at the beauty of where
we are today
my aim is I want to get as many cool
photos of this place as possible safe
I've had lunch I'm gonna walk around
with Raya and we're gonna just twine
just take some awesome instagrams and
I'm gonna talk you guys through how I'm
like composing the shorts and how we're
picking them and then how I'm taking
some of the photos as well so it'll be a
little bit of a tutorial so first stop
on our photo mission isn't actually on
this island we're heading out to a
sandbank which is I don't know how far
away maybe a kilometer away or something
and from there I can send my drone up
I've got with me and get some aerial
photography because I think I was saying
this last night but I can't do any
directly over soil and just because
there's a lot of other guests and it's
kind of quite exclusive so I can't
disturb by the guess but we can get some
aerial shots of the Sam bang and fly bit
closer to this island that gets up
that's gonna be pretty cool
guys look how tiny this place is there
we've been stranded on this island now
they've left us the boat is driving back
to the the main island and we're just
here umbrella and chairs which is pretty
cool and some water
how cool is this yeah I though it's
going to be massive
so that was pretty cool guys that was
definitely a very unique perspective
getting on an isolated tiny little sand
bank we try to get some photos just from
like our level but you can't really get
perspective of where we are and how cool
it is so most the photography that I did
was on the drone shots which you would
have just seen we are now moving on to
some other photo locations so I put on
my 16 to 35 mil lens so we're gonna try
to take some shots although this lens
isn't very good when you've got people
at the edge of the frame we've figured
that out I haven't berea because it
basically stretches the edge of the
frame slightly so people that are on the
edge look a little bit bigger than they
really are side of them just chillin
face is like three times so anyways we
found that out so it's better when
there's a subject in the middle of the
frame with this lens I'm going to put
the time lapse function on this is one
you can download on the Sony Play Store
where it's cool looking at some of the
shots we just turned I think it'd look
more interesting if there's like a palm
tree or a cool little beach hut in the
photo as well rather than just sand and
sea so I think around here would look
pretty cool got palm trees and then
we've got C and we've got the little
Hut's that go onto the water
this time of day the Sun it's basically
glaring off the water so you can see
here you can't see so much of the
turquoise water because we're at an
angle where yeah the sun's is reflecting
but we're facing this way you can really
see the nice color of the water we're
not getting that glare of the Sun so I'm
thinking instead of a shot from behind
we actually set the tripod up here and
get a shot of me Riya min Riya on the
beach shore in the shallows with the
palm trees to mind something in this
this is our shot
so I think those came out pretty good
I've got another idea is me and Ryder
sitting on the edge here and then
looking out that way over the turquoise
little bay area I think this location is
done we now have to rush because we've
got a sunset cruise minutes catch I want
to get some more drone shots of the
island and they'll let me take the drone
off from the boat and yeah and our last
sunset and the Maldives kind of sad the
last sunset
check out this bow this is the most
photogenic bow for sure
I've been looking at this beauty guard
here everything is so cool
so I guess the other thing with travel
photography is you don't want to ruin
moments or get too distracted from
enjoying just being in a cool place or
in a cool situation and this is one of
those times where you kind of want to
film everything but you also just want
to sit back to take it in and enjoy this
sunset and it's awesome boqueron so I
think personally it's just about finding
a balance where you kind of get I
personally like getting my photos and
things first a little video clips and
then kind of put my cameras down for a
little bit and just sitting back and
then maybe getting the cameras out again
at the end doing some stuff these are
the coconuts we got when we arrived it's
orange juice in the coconut water
in cozy right now a dream
thank you oh it's so lovely yeah
alright guys I'm gonna end my vlog here
me and I are gonna take the rest of the
evening to ourselves it's our last night
here and here's a little recap of some
of the cool photos we took today so I
think they turned out pretty good and
hopefully you learn a little bit about
photography and some little tips today
tomorrow I will continue sharing some
little tips we're gonna try and get up
early like I said and film a little bit
more and one the other thing is
something I've been meaning to do this
entire time is do some Star photography
maybe some star lapses with like palm
trees and stuff so I'm gonna run outside
and do that now and you can check it out
sweet I'll catch you guys in the morning
for our trip to Sri Lanka peace out
enjoy life and live the adventure the
