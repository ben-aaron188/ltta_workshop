which is caught a bus up to the mountain
village venue you're going to be
watching a I think it's called life
animated I don't know whether it's
ashore or whether it's like a
feature-length documentary something but
I'm excited this is the place for food
apparently I'm gonna try and get some
soup we got an amazing vegetable soup
we're just want to finish before Vicki's
leaving I put a spicy sauce in there and
I'm hiccuping

was basically sharing a story of a guy
who was autistic and relates to the
whole world through disney films just so
beautifully made we're now going to
catch the cable car back down there to
tell your eyes and watch more movies

London telephone boxes I've no idea why

film we watched it's basically a film
about happiness and you know what
