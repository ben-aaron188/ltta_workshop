special item and the final folder to fix
the ones of these function to place your
in things another national state on this
is on April 22nd 1978 after both went
into self-imposed exile in London for 18
months and this is as a result of an
assassination attempt on Israel arose in
1976 later tour you later never get to
see where that happened
we've been asked not to film inside the
house it's like
rules no filming inside the Molly house
not even a farmer was allowed so you
know what Obama can not will respect
okay this is the only part of the house
I can film this is a recreation of a
record store Bob Marley had in
Trenchtown back in the day check this
out
yeah leaving the house how fun is this
sign guys check this out
careful of fooling mangos you guys know
this song don't worry about a thing he
wrote it while still in here this room
behind Moo's where there's an
assassination attempt on Bob Marley and
like his wife and I think it's manager
and stuff thankfully no one died but
sounds crazy gunmen came in around back
of the house and just opened fire it's
like bullet holes in the walls and stuff
is the one of the greatest master
Drummond precaution is so we just
watched a little movie about Bob
Marley's life this whole tour has been
kind of emotional I wasn't really
expecting much I mean I was expecting it
to be cool but I wasn't expecting to
feel feel emotional so if you ever come
to Jamaica you've got to come to Bob
Marley's house and have
he I think what strikes me the most is
something I want to look more into his
people that were like revolutionaries in
the world and it really hit me that he
was a revolutionary definitely a music
and the amount of war awards we were
shown inside the house like all the
different things he awarded him and also
his like passion to bring peace to the
world like he worked he tried to like
bring political parties together in
different places and celebrated like the
freedom of countries get finding
independence and stuff yeah all very
inspiring so this is Rohan Marley
he's one of Bob Marley's sons and I'm
gonna go an interview hopefully can I
ask you a couple of things sure yeah I
just wondered like learning a bit about
your father and like watching the
presentation what do you think the
biggest impact is left in your life of
thing given you know like given oneself
to others just not living our life just
based upon selfishness you know means
trying to do things that's going to
better not just your well-being but
others as well so that's it you know
being selfless
and the teacher is majestic
which which all is love you know because
it all comes down to love and just being
loving and know that we're all want
that's what you taught us so just write
the money for sex yeah one love less not
so this is Ricky we're just about to sit
down and have some lunch what's the most
inspiring thing that you found about the
Molly family working with them well it's
very easy just yesterday I was talking
to one of it started Stephanie Molly and
approached the the art they have four
people no I found a perfect love within
that family they're doing a lot for
people worldwide and they don't talk
about it why some people to just
identity and they have it all over the
media what Bob Marley and his family
when they do things they don't want to
hear about it they don't want to talk
about it at one point of Bob Marley
interview he said if I must live my life
for myself alone I don't want to live I
want to live my life for the people and
Bob Marley's any one of
interview again he said we don't have
any ambition what we have and what we
want to see in his every nation on the
face of the earth
must come together until their love on
the one foundation knowing that we are
are running black white no matter where
you from
just bill our love on the one foundation
and that's the perfect law we're now
heading off to tuff Gong studios which
is Bob Marley's music studios nearby
we're going to meet local artists so
we're going to go and check out this
local artist / mark and see around the
studio and then go for a little talk

traveling to me often those sometimes
are difficult but when I'm like editing

Riya is jamming out you won't even hear
me right now I want to test out this
little guy as well good man
something I've loved today learning
about the Marley family is the heart
behind everything they do and the
different companies are involved with so
Antony's going to tell us tell us about
the house and Mollie like the ethics
behind there and the heart behind it
basically the house is Molly brand and
came to life by the one family wanted to
keep his work ethic his love of music
love of alive and they've been fed by a
sound and you know like house money

brand presents awesome

that was a very rare opportunity
apparently all right when you finish
your music from out of the studio to
transfer it over to this this is
actually the record final pebbles this
is what vinyl looks like the floor you
make it that is cool engineer would dump
the vinyl pebbles in here
process will start come through here to
a potty farm but you have to put a label
on while it's hot engineer would come
over there he would fly that everything
is up and running you have a Stamper in
there this is the music couple minutes
hydraulic flat and spread the material
it come out to this but it's unfinished
because it still have to trim and
punched and the way they do that is with
this machine over here so they would
actually put it on there
everything of handles and once they do
this that machine would drop on it and
everything would go their separate ways
this would go in there yes and this just
drop they clean everything up and then
you have your record ready for the road
just casually gonna sign the ball at Bob
Marley's final person factory
