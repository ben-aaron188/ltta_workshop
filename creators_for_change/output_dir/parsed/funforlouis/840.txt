it's just gone 6:30 and we have
clambered out of bed and doing that the
lodge to get some breakfast and then we
are doing a little Drive it's me tribe
what's the name of the tribe we're gonna
meet him
the Himba yeah about him and that's the
people who have traditionally like from
this area or originally from this area
the Himba tribe should be quite cool we
have eggs bacon and sausage for
breakfast and also the smallest apple in
the world it's time to head off
the humor also they're just always
coming from the northern part of Libya
for always for my goal at least also
know him by the birthday and there is
more environmental
we've just been learning some
fascinating facts about the Himba tribe
from whether our guide who's saying if
you want to marry a woman you pay three
count I think if you murder a woman you
have to repay the family forty five cows
and they don't get the government
involved and it's like they've been
running their own law system yeah
there's some crazy traditions here it's
fascinating and also your first wife has
to be your cousin usually they try and
marry their cousin they're afraid of
Louie's hair yeah Wow it's like really
hard like man that's much better than
what you have
because smoothies good standards no on
it hey so this is the die that they use
in their hair and skin
it's called ochre and they crush it oh
yeah breathing a little bit and it's
just they're trying to speak this
language no you hear it also but while
their head hit it on the same same who
do you think guys against the
traditional tribal face pain I think
we're I think we're part of the clan now
yeah hello
they don't mean that set windows no only
small homes would love to stay here for
a week to come and live with these guys
they said thank you for they are all
bonded they are always making like this
just chillin how awesome is this guys
she's got she's got a mobile phone yeah
sweetie
Nokia yeah this is so fascinating guys
yeah
teaching these kids some photography
skills over there they're good they seem
to figure things out yeah like he knows
the top screen
was crazy
it looks really chill or he's dying one
other - I want a pet goat I'm stealing
this goat guys Cillian come bro a
venture with my pet goat now although
this tribe rely mainly on trading for
stuff often Trading cows they are and
they do use money as well so they are
selling some little objects that they've
made and we can buy them I'm terrible at
buying gifts though I thinking to buy
something for dancing my little sister I
think I'm like maybe buy one of these
little baskets it's nice
maybe she can keep that nail varnish in
there or something well they drive a
hard bargain I could only afford to buy
this basket but it's pretty cool I like
that you could put stuff in there like
maybe like earrings or something
but you can tell them I'm their friend I
think I've harassed these village
peoples enough this girl over here is
actually scared of me she's run away
she's like that guy's crazy
so when tourists like me come and visit
villages like this it can seem a bit
intrusive I'm still trying to figure out
what's appropriate and everything and
not treat them like we're just staring
and taking photos one of the things the
lodge that was staying at they do when
we come and visit is they give them
gifts so we're giving them some food
maize and stuff like that and for the
families that stay here goodbye we're
back at lodge and still got this place
paint on and we are having hey guys it's
probably one of the most awesome
locations I've ever had laptops up we're
just chilling out in this valley it's
just peaceful
having drinking our coffee I could stay
here for a while you know also get some
inspiration because this is all built
outward and net natural staff they think
in treehouse vibes for lunch we have
some traditional african spaghetti
bolognaise and i feel like me and jake

over my laptop yeah I put it in my mouth
like to drink it and it's stumbling so
I'm alone and I just in my reaction was
just to spit out literally spat out all
over that so check this guy out

little guy all right you just say that
and think about what you've done okay

afternoon despite getting stung by the
wasp

over there but I think it's a bit short
notice and so we're going to go hang out

more
back at the village the kids recognized
me from a fire they were like hey cuz I
put my hair up in a pineapple earlier

good idea to bring an iPad along I
thought would be cool because it's like
it's like full screen selfies for them

went out to a goat and milk - she's got
