a nice smooth like yeah but yes starting
that one to see if you want okay we the
ingredients we have here
so basically we're making dinner for
Nick and Ange riah Justine who else is
going to dinner quite a few people and
we'd have these are like little sliced
courgettes zucchinis what's this widget
that is better net
what's better net roast butternut squash

got any questions whilst we're doing
this yeah feel free to ask let me know
you can hear it can you hear us as well
how's it tasting yeah yeah get on this
one
Jesse's in and Jesse probably knows how
to do this better than me you you've
probably done more kicking than me right
yeah exactly you read my mind
exactly I'm gonna start in this one
Jesse smear it
this is sun-dried tomato pesto nice okay
that's it how's it taste
please get something we smear this is
the base I love your little giggle
that's cool
okay as you can tell guys I'm not very
experienced at this okay right should we
make smiley faces we're gonna make
smiley faces we can lay in it yeah
that's fine Nick and ang both aren't
here right now I don't know why they've
allowed me to babysit Jesse though okay
right so we try and write live the
adventure with these little zucchinis
let's start with a simple smiley face
can you do on a slice just give me a
nice slice of avocado this isn't too
sharp is it no okay I'll get I'll slice
the avocado you can do a nice smiley
face okay
this is how you slice that look holiday
I'm saying like I know guys any ideas
for our pizzas like exactly how we
should decorate them the last night we
still lived can you check yeah okay cool
okay I've got a nice slice of avocado
here suggest that you here's the other
card a be really gentle and just place
that nicely on the pizza base as a smile
here you go take that does it taste good
yeah okay they get there's a smile would
be too little eyes this is perfect
and the noise Jessie that was the that
was the mouth
you just ate the mouth okay okay
we're gonna have to do another slice cuz
you you ate it you ate the mouth but
that's okay that's fine
how do we need to put this in the oven
okay guys we're gonna save this door
after we cook there let's try some oh
and justice these are the ingredients
you can put on here like this yeah just
slap them on there don't me to finish
I'll finish your bass video I'll finish
spreading okay right guys what do you

pizza not making I think we could throw
some award zucchinis on here okay vegan
mozzarella yeah perfect
- can you squash this dizzy just squish

yeah just push this yes it squish it
like that
chickpeas okay we could try some
chickpeas just sprinkle those on not see

squish bit about screen Jesse can you
help me squish than this Jesse your
speed you go can you help me squish some
of this is squish it shit perfect

think raw or cooked onion okay
sprinkling this around we're saving a
Bacardi two after yeah how many do we

one aged why never try to eat not one
piece of each yeah I'm thinking maybe

a we were watching a vlog today where he
was only five days old right and he
little it's completely dim you've really
grown up since I lost since we last saw
you last year Jessie it doesn't like

what's this what's this you're holding
it okay we've got another guest arriving
right now we're doing a live stream oh

need some need some help Jesse it's good
it builds the immune system live stream
yeah okay so we get some sweet corn

bananas and tomatoes and some sweet corn
yeah that's it get it get it just mush
it up a bit
taste it yeah how's it taste thing yeah
cool let's sprinkle some one guy's weird
I think we're doing well it made like
five pizzas so far um I think that's
wait yeah Nick and ang haven't featured
much in my vlogs and Cape Town they've
been preoccupied with this little guy do
you turns out he's a master chef yeah no
you don't need to do any more taste
testing and also let's put the pizza
here because then when you
then when it moves out your mouth then
when it pulls out your mouth they can go
on that yeah he said three words on this
live stream he said banana banana and
dad can I have a kiss from work can I
have a kiss
move on to the final piece of guys okay
we've done the banana piece so this is
this this is a shout-out to the South
Africans not quite sure whether it's
gonna work I'm gonna go for another
classic yes we got any more mozzarella
mozzarella okay yeah okay
slippery it's slippery the answer
surprised the chair got really slippery
okay guys my own Jessi did a great job
don't worry about him okay we've got the
tomatoes spread with useless inspire
we've used this entire jar this vegan
mozzarella sister being mozzarella guys
don't worry about Jesse he's fine I'm
gonna tell you the ingredients for this
mozzarella cuz a lot of people don't
realize you get vegan cheese this is
made from tapioca starch tree nuts
including almonds cashews sunflower
coconut macadamia this is like really
healthy cheese basically oh that's good
like a weenus squeeze or wonder if it
melts in the same way as normal geez
okay this is the last piece of guys once
you've done this open in the oven and
we'll stop cooking
the other ones already cooking a little
bit I was never particularly a tease
person before I went vegan so it's not
one of those cravings I get a lot of
people ask me that but thankfully I
think
okay right I'm gonna go with a bit more
of a standard pizza you better Jesse
okay Jesse's recovered from his fall
this is all a part of growing up in life
really
sometimes when you fall down you just
have to get up again he just wasn't
enjoying the equation a bit like but you
know okay
okay Jesse is it
bath time now I think I'm supposed to be
bedtime but biggest birthday Doudna
taste do you wanna do a taste test on
this avocado I'm jealous of you hmm
guys I've been making smoothies every
morning with an advocate a whole avocado
two bananas and a bunch of other stuff
but it's good my avocado intakes good at
the moment okay anyway we've finished
our pizza making this is the final peep
something I wanted to do more like
smiley faces and stuff but um it's a
little bit more tricky in this in this
chaos do you like chaos chaos Jesse so
we haven't made too much of a mess
thankfully
how much are they 24 end okay they're
kind of average yeah and then there's
these ones these ones are the ones that
grow here right the green ones the brown
ones are imported from Hispaniola
hey guys thumbs up for have a guard
later now you two have some tomato paste
we haven't actually put in each spicy
supplemented we have no pony spice on
the pizzas guys hey guys another time we
probably conduit in this live stream but
Jessie can actually skateboard he lies
on the penny board
yeah only he was sitting on it and
sitting upright and doing the doing this
pushing himself along anyway I did want
to like hang around in the livestream
until we could actually eat some of
these pieces but I feel like it's gonna
take a while to cook so it might be a
bit boring right let me wash my hands
are getting quickly Jessie can you just
chat to big come dizzy show them show
them your tricks say say banana Fernanda
mmm-hmm banana but no no can you say
banana
Nick what's the main thing that's
changing your life becoming a dad it's
just in case I'll become a dad one day
on eating the case yeah it's it's it's a
change having a lot more
responsibilities but and it's the amount
of free time that you get
it is considerably less than you imagine
yeah but it's amazing I think like it
there's something that you're like you
feel like you're born for this
and you mean to do this so yeah it's
okay instantly although there's a loss
of freedom
it's actually like a welcomed loss and
so you kind of have the second amazing
experience and it's like when when you
see your child for the first time
they're like yeah this is your father
they hand it to you like this like like
that except he looks like an alien
yeah he's covered in blood in this man's
face is like and he's crying and and it
is literally like someone says to you oh
by the way aliens exist and here's one
well it's that weird like it's that much
of a shock to your system alien yeah so
it's it's a yeah it's totally weird like
nothing on your entire life of my points
even comes close to how weird that
feeling is so it's something to really
look for tip special fear yeah yeah any
questions for neck guys before we end
the livestream any other parenting
questions for nikah ranch because this
is all this is all fascinating anyone
wine for the kid no Jesse's not drinking
wine does he do okay it's been I feel
like even like being in the House today
to getting some work done for like a
little while realizing how much
attention babies need it's like yeah
it's kind of crazy on but it's also
really enjoyable looking after babies
but but maybe like like half an hour
away when you actually appear and they
said are you gonna have another baby
yeah how old is Jessie we've already
said a few times but he's 11 months 11
months old yeah so one said what is
happening okay guys this was like an
experimental video we're just doing a
live stream to see where the Jeff see
could help me make some pieces and he's
done a great job I'm gonna just pick up
okay this is this is the pizzas two of
the pizzas come and check in the oven
now I'd probably have to end the
livestream soon this is this is the
pizzas in the oven
