good morning guys
sprite an early it's I don't know like
almost 7 a.m. and me and Raya been
invited to come on a breakfast show and
Cape Town called espresso which is gonna
be it's pretty exciting I think it's
it's quite popular show and we're going
to be talking about like our travels
little bit about the world fly and then
traveling together as a couple and
anyway and I just had a bit of makeup
done I've got my bag with me because
they want to talk about how I packed
like mostly tech only any place like a
nice setup guys this is legit
so if you were asked what is your dream
job I think most people would answer
traveling the globe experiencing all the
beauty and culture that the world has to
offer and yes be paid for it well Louie
Cole is a man who's managed to do
exactly that
hailing from the UK he's one of the
world's most popular bloggers and more
than 2 million people subscribed to his
YouTube channel fun for Louie and follow
him as he inspires through traveling the
world and documenting his adventures
let's take a quick look at that we're
watching scenes from your recent trip
where you traveled to 22 countries in a
single-engine Cessna right away with one
of your very good mate who's a pilot
yeah what was that adventure like and
what's what lies in the future for you
so this was like a three-month trip that
we've been planning for years my friend
JP is a pilot and we haven't managed to
circumnavigate the world which only a
few hundred people have ever done so I
thought that was pretty exciting yeah
yeah and also make a documentary from it
which I'm currently still in the editing
process of Louis often also features a
very special lady in his life his
girlfriend Riya who sometimes surprises
him and features him while he's not
aware take a look at this quickly
hey I'm Raya
and this is hopefully the story of how
I'm gonna surprise my boyfriend that is
absolutely priceless and ladies and
gentlemen the winner of the most
surprising girlfriend of the riah I must
I mean that looks book for yourself oh
my god I think again it's so amazing to
have our own channels and our own ideas
and our own styles of filmmaking but
like we're able to support each other
and help each other with our idea as
well yeah shining in our own way where
do you guys see the future of this
YouTube thing going like what's the
promise in it for youngsters out there
who are creatives like you who have a
passion it might not be traveling music
could be the art it can be the culinary
science whatever it might be where do
you think the future lies in YouTube I
think for me like it's just an amazing
platform for anyone to have a voice and
I think that's the great thing about the
Internet as well it's it provides us
platform and to hopefully spread good
to Jews and positive stuff it is really
competitive because obviously everyone's
wanting to do it now about yes yeah but
I still think kind of pursue your dreams
I wouldn't try and aim to get into it
from the start as a career yeah and it's
amazing that we both have the
opportunity to have this is our living
but I think do something you're
passionate about and treat it as yeah
just just a fun thing that you can
pursue rather than necessarily wait to
make money or something place we're like
halfway through the things we're doing
off it really it's all these different
signals coming in and out like sure
there's a new user this is kind of
seeing how everywhere
and it's like three two one guy and then
like they do that little bit love seeing
how it works there was like a switch
that went off one time when I was
vlogging and I was like I just need to
get all the numbers out of my head like
who's gonna watch this in this book what
would I want to tell my friends back at
home especially on our travel
experiences you know what would you
write home about what would you write
your mom about your best friend about
and I think the more that like when you
think of it that way and just picture
your best friend behind the camera then
you're it's so much much easier to just
be genuine and yeah it's great advice
and I love it I can't wait to check your
stuff out you can follow at fun for
Louie you can follow it at Riya was here
libya venture was started just over a
year ago it kind of started off the back
of the management team I had kind of
helping me with a lot of the backend
stuff that's involved in being a travel
vlog ah yes fun for Louie and yeah this
is the first trip that the clip you just
saw was the first trip that we had kind
of officially hosting people we flew
different people from around the world
yeah they aim for us is for this trip
was just to involve other big
influencers a lot of other travel
instagramers and youtubers and yeah I
guess create a space where we could make
incredible content but also behind the
scenes just connect with one another and
chat and kind of try and dream together
about how how can we do more in the
world and change the world for the
better
yes I mean we can talk about Chelsea Sam
Agee Helen and Zach some of the people
who brought along with you but if
they're South African influences out
there and content creators that want to
link up with you and shared their ideas
of how you can better put out the
message how do they do that what do you
want what are you looking for so we've
got a team based here it's a small team
at the moment we're looking to expand
and get other people on board that we
can I guess some people we can represent
exclusively with the management agency
but for me also it's just about kind of
connecting with people as a collective
and saying like how can we collaborate
do projects together well I would love
to spend more time and and get to know
Cape Town on a deeper level and doing
that with other Creators is amazing so
well these guys are sort of be able to
show you around I mean by the rest of
the team here
and to say thank you so so much for
joining it's been amazing and your
journeys inspire all of us okay we're
