got questions and we got don't uh
doesn't happen every night thank you to
whoever gave us Donuts I would now like
to bring to the stage for the very first
time human brains are remarkably
flexible I've been lucky enough to have
had a bunch of moments of tremendous
positive shift in my life going to
college to summer camp moving to a new
place going on and coming back from tour
it's amazing how fast I find my brain
shifts to accept that this new life is
my life now and then when I go back to
my old life that life is my life now
that transition is overwhelming yeah
definitely but it also it's an
opportunity to examine my work and what
I want to be doing and I'm very glad to
have shared this intense experience with
you John and with so many other people
and do have made people happy and to
just think out loud about what it means
to be a person but I am also very very
very happy to be back home John I'll see
you on Tuesday
