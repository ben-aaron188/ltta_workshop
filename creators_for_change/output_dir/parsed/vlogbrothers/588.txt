good morning John so I got some good
news I got some bad news about Syria
that's a lie I only have bad news it is
only bad news it is a terrible situation
but there is no solving problems that
you don't understand so here it is in
the next five or six minutes we're gonna
understand Syria at least more than we
did before
all right let's start at the foundation
of Syria a bunch of Western powers are
introducing the idea of nation-states to
the rest of the world they draw a shape
on a piece of paper and say this shape
shall be Syria inside that shape are
lots of different sorts of people who
have various degrees of historical and
social ties there are Christians in
Druze and Sunni Muslims and Alla whites
and of course pluralism does not
necessarily breed violence but we let's
just wait and see fast forward to the
Cold War the first world of the USA and
the second world of the USSR are nabbing
up alliances with the third world of
everyone else
Russia nabbed Syria through a
combination of diplomacy and giving guns
they helped the ostensibly socialist
bath party take control in Syria the
bath party was run by Alouettes the
leader was a guy whose last name was
Assad the father of the current Assad
and even though the Cold War is now over
though apparently no one has told the
United States defense budget Russia
continues to be closely allied with
Syria and relies on Syria for its sweet
warm water ports which Russia lacks
because it is Russia in the years since
the bath party took over in 1970 Syria
has become kind of a segregated place
the scholarships go to allow eat
children government contracts go to
allow a businesses there are literally
lanes of traffic that only Alawite
people are allowed to drive in majority
of Syria are Sunni Muslim the official
Sunni Muslim stands on a low i'ts is
that they have rejected the teachings of
Islam that combined to the fact that
they been repressed for like 40 years
creates some sectarian tension that
during the Arab Spring broke open this
is a struggle between a powerful
minority and a disenfranchised majority
peaceful pro-democracy protests were
swiftly punished by the Assad regime
first by putting people in jail then
they kept protesting then they started
to kill them then they protested more
violently then they started to torture
their children and killed their families
it's bad then the big hunk of the army
defected and became the Free Syrian Army
hey continues however to get more
confusing while the original protest was
a pro
democracy protest and there are still
many rebels fighting for a democratic
future are now tons of different rebel
groups that all want different things
and some of them like each other and
some of them don't some of them love al
Qaeda and some of them love democracy
this isn't Star Wars there's no Rebel
Alliance it's messy and it's muddy and
to make things worse if we are talking
about star wars here Assad has basically
killed Luke Skywalker and Han and Leia
and blown up Alderaan and Admiral
Ackbar's gone to Sods forces have killed
so many non Alawite civilian and
military leaders that it's completely
unclear who they would take over if you
left now four years all this was
happening outside of the international
spotlight but then chemical weapon
President Obama had previously stated
that there is a red line and that if
Syria uses chemical weapons something
and it looks as if Assad's forces did
use chemical weapons sarin gas was
definitely used and it was definitely
used on the enemies of Assad's regime
now claims to the contrary to me feel
very much like 1960s America where white
people actually believed that African
American radicals bombed an
african-american church in order to make
the KKK look bad ah Russia has veto
power in the UN Security Council and
they have never allowed the UN to take
action against Assad because Russia
loves Assad and he's the only eye they
have in the Middle East and those warm
water polo Obama wants to enforce his
red line even without the UN support and
the American people are like oh god no
not again no presidents like well once
upon a time it was Congress's job to
decide whether or not we attacked other
countries so let's let them decide which
is funny because as we all know if
Congress were on fire Congress could not
pass the pour water on Congress act just
like Russia needs Assad Assad needs
Russia and so Assad is willing to do a
lot of what Russia tells him to do which
leads us to John Kerry making the
weirdest possible accidental act of
diplomacy of all time when he was like
yeah I mean Assad could prevent us from
attacking them he could sway just by
giving us all of his chemical weapons
he's not gonna happen but he could do it
and Russia it was like oh hey we can do
that it's nice for Russia because now
they get to put on the well-mannered
diplomatic hero hat which they don't get
to wear very much lately due to of their
corruption and dismantling of democracy
and freedom plus let's not forget that
Russia blocking any possible action by
the
UN is why we are in this mess in the
first place now it's possible that
Russia is just enabling Assad stalling
and if it happens it will be extremely
complicated to collect a bunch of
chemical weapons out of a country that
is in the middle of a civil war that
would be an excellent outcome to be able
to enforce the international norm
against chemical weapons not have to
blow anything up or ask Congress to do
anything when it comes down to it that
anyone who says that they know what we
should do in this situation is either
being disingenuous or they don't know
what they're talking about
maybe attacking us odd and empowering
the rebels will save millions of lives
maybe it will cost millions of lives
maybe the power vacuum left by Assad
would be filled with Islamists who would
be sympathetic to al-qaeda problem with
the future is that it is unknowable and
so we don't really know what we should
do if there is something that we can do
maybe not for the overall geopolitics of
the situation but for individual people
Syrian civil war has displaced over two
million people and if you would like to
join me and donate into the UN refugee
agency that money will go to helping
those people rebuild their lives John
I'll see you on Tuesday
