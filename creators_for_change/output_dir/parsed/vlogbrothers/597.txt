good morning Hank it's Tuesday so I want
to talk about shailene woodley and her
beautiful hair but let's begin at the
University of California at Berkeley
where for the last couple years
psychologists have been engaging in a
series of fascinating experiments
centered on the board game Monopoly
because you know that's what
psychologists do with grant money so all
these Monopoly games are set up but in
each of them one player has a huge
advantage like starting with more money
for instance basically the game is
rigged but the crazy thing is that the
people the game is rigged in favor of
come to believe over time that the game
is more fair than it actually is and
that in fact they deserve their
advantages similarly a bunch of studies
have shown that rich and or successful
people tend to be the least empathetic
the least generous and this is
completely true Hank they are more
likely to steal candy from a baby this
is all a function of something called
the just world fallacy most of us
believe and in fact can't help but
believe that people in essence get what
they deserve in life and the just world
fallacy has the effect of making rich or
successful people less empathetic and
less generous because they believe that
they deserve their success and that also
people who are less successful deserve
that lack of success but it's important
to note that this doesn't just apply to
like Wall Street bankers it's also true
for all of us like Hank the vast
majority people watching this video feel
entitled to own or at least regularly
ride in cars and yet if all seven
billion people on earth have the same
relationship with automobiles that I
have we would be totally screwed as a
planet not just echo logically but also
the traffic but the weird is the most
troubling part of this research is that
no matter who you give the advantage to
in these rigged games of monopoly people
tend to behave in pretty much the same
way Hank that means that on some level
people aren't wielding power power is
wielding people I've been thinking about
this ever since noted rapper in public
intellectual Lupe Fiasco tweeted about
it when man does harnessed power can he
only do so in the same tradition as
those who have had it before him and
thus yield only the same results as
those who had power before him I often
disagree with Lupe Fiasco but those are
very interesting and provocative
questions like we all know the
disappointment of electing a new leader
and expecting things to really change
only to find out that change is sort of
measured but maybe that's true not only
in politics but also at like middle
school playgrounds the monopoly
experiments imply that maybe in the end
individuals are just vehicles through
which power is wielded
that would mean that even very powerful
people are in fact not that powerful at
all they're just doing what power tells
them to do Hank I'm concerned about this
in my own life he said just noticing
that his shirt matches the wall right
but anyway I'm concerned about it
because I want nerdfighteria to be an
active and effective force against
worldsuck and I don't want it to be just
another community whose goal was to
become big and powerful but it's really
hard both personally and communally to
resist that urge toward power and I
think that's why we're gonna try to make
things even more transparent around here
so that nerdfighteria can hold us
accountable and so that we can work
together to decrease worldsuck
effectively which brings me at long last
to shailene woodley and her hair so hank
Shailene is gonna play hazel in The
Fault in Our Stars movie and Shailene is
that rare soul who despite becoming
successful stays weird and empathetic
and just wonderful like she's often
called it hippie by the media but it's
mostly because she cares about ethical
eating and trying to minimize her
footprint which by the way so does hazel
grace Lancaster
anyway last week Shay glean had a great
idea just to cut her hair to play hazel
grace of course and she's going to
donate her hair to children with hair
loss an organization that provides free
wigs to kids who've lost their hair
because of illnesses or burns and I'm
gonna donate some money to that
organization so they can make the wigs
because I do not have enough hair
although some wives would argue that I
maybe have too much on my face but
anyway I thought it would be cool if
other people wanted to join Shailene in
doing this you need at least eight
inches of hair more info in the
doobly-doo so the summer I think I hope
we can be aware of the unfair monopoly
trap and try not to fall into it let's
try to remember that the world isn't
just because only then will we have the
power to change it Hank I'll see you on
Friday
