I apologize oh what a terrible first
impression and it's still going
cut to a thing hello my name is grace
Helbig or I go by Daily Grace here on
YouTube because I make daily videos five
days a week I have been graced with the
wonderful honor of filling in for John
Green while he's away dealing with the
spawn that has happened through him with
him and in his wife the vlogbrothers
have been very inspirational to me they
are very smart articulate nurturing
progressive community or driven human
beings that exist too based on our
happiness and their own brains fortitude
and so it is really stressful to have to
fill in for one of them I have been
racking my brain for weeks thinking of
what should I do for this video and I
came to a conclusion I am not as smart
as them I'm gonna teach you how to trick
people into thinking that maybe you're
more intelligent or cultural or socially
sophisticated than you really are
let's do this try to use the word
derivative when describing something

derivative of this other piece of art

talking about reminds you of the film

your back pocket throwing a joke like

French press yeah you carry a messenger
