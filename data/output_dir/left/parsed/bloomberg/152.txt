IS "BLOOMBERG WEST."
THE EU HANDS APPLE'S HARSHEST
PENALTY EVER, ORDERING THEM TO
COUGH UP $14 BILLION.
BUT WILL -- WILL THE WORLD'S
RICHEST COMPANY PAY?
IS EUROPE PUTTING THE TECH GIANT
ON NOTICE?
HE'S THE GODFATHER OF ONLINE
BLOGGING -- AS WILLIAMS JOIN US
ON A CONVERSATION FROM
EVERYTHING ON THE FREEDOM OF
INTERNET IN THE FUTURE OF
PUBLISHING.
AND MAKING TECH M&A HISTORY --
SET TO CLOSE A MEGA-HEAD DEAL
AFTER WAS RUBBERSTAMPED BY
CHINESE REGULATORS.
BUT FIRST TO OUR LEAD --
EUROPEAN REGULATORS SLAM APPLE
WITH A 14.5 LIEN DOLLAR TAX
BILL, FAR AND AWAY THE LARGEST
TAX WILL IN A CRACKDOWN ON
SO-CALLED SWEETHEART DEALS.
-- 14.5 BILLION DOLLARS.
IN THIS CASE, IRELAND, IT'S
CORPORATE TAX RATE IS THE LOWEST
IN WESTERN EUROPE AND HAS
ATTRACTED MORE THAN 700 U.S.
COMPANIES TO SET UP SHOP,
INCLUDING GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK.
APPLE EMPLOYEES ABOUT 6000
PEOPLE IN IRELAND BUT THE EU
COMPETITION COMMISSIONER SAYS
IRELAND ALLOWED APPLE TO PAY AN
EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 1% ON
EUROPEAN PROFITS DOWN TO .005%
IN 2014 AND THAT GAVE APPLE AN
UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.
HERE SHE IS IN AN INTERVIEW WITH
BLOOMBERG EARLIER.
>> THAT TAX RATE IN IRELAND IS
12.5% AND OBVIOUSLY, MOST
COMPANIES AT THE NATIONAL OR
MULTINATIONAL LEVEL PAY THE TAX
RATE OR CORPORATE TAX RATE IN
IRELAND AND THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT
SOME COMPANIES IN CASE APPLE
ONLY PAYS A TINY, TINY FRACTION
A THEMSELVES HAVE TO PAY.
THAT IS OBVIOUSLY NOT FAIR
COMPETITION.
IT IS NOT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD.
EMILY: WE SPOKE TO THE IRISH
FINANCE MR. -- FINANCE MINISTER.
BUT FIRST, I WANT TO BRING IN
MATT LARSON WHO HAS BEEN DOING A
DEEP DIVE AS WELL AS OUR
BLOOMBERG NEWS REPORTER WHO
COVERS APPLE FOR US.
WE KNEW APPLE WAS GOING TO
APPEAL, BUT WHAT WAS THE
RESPONSE FROM THE COMPANY?
ALEX: THAT THEY ARE NOT HAPPY.
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE
SURPRISED ABOUT THE SCALE OF THE
BACK PAYMENT DATE ARE GOING TO
HAVE TO COME UP WITH.
THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN PUT IN
PLACE SINCE 1991 AND IT WAS
ALWAYS LEGAL.
THEY NEVER USED ANY ILLEGAL
LOOPHOLES THAT THE AGREEMENT
THEY HAD WAS SUCH THAT IT WAS
ABOVE BOARD.
EMILY: WE HAVE A LETTER FROM TIM
COOK TO USERS, INCLUDING THE
ORIGINAL PICTURES OF STEVE JOBS
AT THE FACTORY IN IRELAND.
ALEX: HE WENT ALONG AND OPENED A
PLANT IN CORK.
APPLE, AS EVER, THEY TALK ABOUT
THE CUSTOMER AND NOT
JOURNALISTS.
WHO IS WRITING THE STORY, OF
COURSE, THE JOURNALISTS.
GUEST: APPLE IN IRELAND WILL
APPEAL THIS TO THE GENERAL COURT
IN LUXEMBOURG.
IT'S THE COURT EARLY HEARING THE
APPEALS IN THE STARBUCKS
NETHERLANDS INVESTIGATION AND
THE FIAT CHRYSLER CASE, BOTH OF
WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER
BUT COULD GIVE SOME INDICATION
INTO HOW THIS APPEALS COURT MAY
TAKE THE DECISIONS.
THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS GOING TO
TAKE TWO YEARS AT LEAST TO
DETERMINE AND AFTER THAT, THERE
ARE FURTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO
APPEAL TO EVEN HIGHER COURTS IN
EUROPE.
IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE A WHILE
BEFORE WE GET A DECISION IN
THESE CASES.
EMILY: THE U.S. HAS BEEN
STEPPING UP ITS DEFENSE APPLE,
CALLING THE EU A SUPERNATURAL
TAX AUTHORITY, INDICATING THEY
ARE OVERSTEPPING THEIR BOUNDS.
WHAT DID WE HEAR FROM THE UNITED
STATES GOVERNMENT TODAY?
ALEX: I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE
CAREFUL ABOUT CALLING IT A
DEFENSE OF APPLE.
THEY ARE INTERESTED IN ENSURING
THE TAXES PAID IN THE U.S. 
EVERY DOLLAR APPLE PAYS AND
TAXES OVERSEAS IS DEDUCTIBLE
FROM THE TAX THEY MIGHT HAVE TO
PAY SHOULD THEY HAVE TO
REPATRIATE THEIR FUND.
EMILY: WE MENTIONED THAT APPLE
IS FIGHTING THIS RULING.
IRELAND IS FIGHTING THIS AS
WELL.
WHY WOULD IRELAND WANT TO
COLLECT $14 BILLION FROM THE
RICHEST COMPANY IN THE WORLD?
MARK BARTON SPOKE TO MICHAEL
NOONAN EARLIER AND POINTED OUT
THE OPPOSITION PARTY IN IRELAND
WOULD LIKE TO SEE JUST THAT.
MARK: WHY DO YOU JUST ACCEPT
MONEY AND SHUT UP?
$13 BILLION IS A LOT OF MONEY.
GUEST: I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
FOR DEVISING THE GOVERNMENT ON
THESE MATTERS.
THIS HAS RESCUED IRELAND FROM
2011 ON AND FROM THE CREATION OF
HIGH LEVEL JOBS, IT'S
FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR ECONOMIC
POLICIES AND WE STAND BY OUR
ECONOMIC POLICIES AND WE'RE
GOING TO PROTECT OUR ECONOMIC
POLICIES.
WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET INTO A
SITUATION OF SHORT TERM GAIN FOR
LONG-TERM DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY.
EMILY: STANDING HIS GROUND
THERE.
WHAT KIND OF LONG-TERM ADVANTAGE
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?
ALEX: AS WE HEARD YESTERDAY,
PEOPLE WERE SAYING ON A SCALE OF
ONE TO 10, 10 BEING EXTREMELY
DAMAGING, 23.
IRELAND HAS 140,000 PEOPLE
EMPLOYED BY U.S. TECH COMPANIES
AND THE RISK IS THEY START TO BE
PUT AT RISK AND IT CEASES TO BE
THE PLACE WHERE COMPANIES MIGHT
GO IF THEY GO TO EUROPE.
IRELAND IS ABOUT 180 ILION EUROS
IN DEBT, SO THIS WILL GO TOWARD
PAYING THAT OFF.
WHY SHOULD I SUBSIDIZE APPLE TO
HAVE 5500 JOBS IN IRELAND?
EMILY: YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT
THE TAX STRUCTURE OTHER
COMPANIES HAVE.
DO ANY OF THEM HAVE THIS SIMILAR
ARRANGEMENT?
MATT: A LOT OF COMPANIES MAKE
USE OF IRELAND -- WE THINK ABOUT
IT AS THE AUSTIN, TEXAS OF
EUROPE.
THEY'VE DEVELOPED FAVORABLE TAX
LAWS RELATED TO TRANSFER
PRICING.
AS A RESULT, YOU HAVE A LOT OF
COMPANIES THAT HAVE
ORGANIZATIONS, SUBSIDIARIES SET
UP IN IRELAND THAT HAVE TRANSFER
PRICING ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE.
YOU HAVE LIFE SCIENCE FROM A
CYNICAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE
SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS.
THERE ARE FAVORABLE TAX LAWS AND
FAVORABLE TREATMENT FOR OTHER
TAX SYSTEM TREATS THESE PRICING
AGREEMENTS.
IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A WARNING
SHOT AND MAY ENCOURAGE SOME
COMPANIES TO TAKE A LOOK AT
WHETHER MAYBE THEY NEGOTIATED TO
SUITE A DEAL OR TAKE A LOOK AT
CORPORATE STRUCTURES AND HOW
THEIR OVERALL SETUP IS WORKING
FOR THEM.
EMILY: HOW ABOUT COMPANIES LIKE
GOOGLE OR FACEBOOK WHICH HAVE
EGG BASES IN IRELAND AND ARE
BASED IN ALL OF EUROPE -- BIG
ACES IN IRELAND.
MATT: A LOT OF COMPANIES HAVE
HEADQUARTERED THERE.
LINKEDIN, PAYPAL, EA -- FIDELITY
INVESTMENTS EVEN HAS SIGNIFICANT
OPERATIONS THERE.
WHEN YOU ARE ONE OF THESE
ORGANIZATIONS, YOU HAVE TO TAKE
A VERY CLOSE LOOK AT HOW YOUR
TAXATION IS WORKING, NOT JUST IN
THE REVENUE YOU ARE SENDING BUT
WHAT ARE THE COMMUNICATIONS YOU
HAVE HAD WITH THE TAX
AUTHORITIES?
IT'S NOT JUST HERE IS OUR
REVENUE, TAKE A PERCENTAGE OF
IT.
LOOKING AT COMPANY TRANSFERS AND
DEALS AMONGST THE SUBSIDIARIES.
YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
WHAT THE BASIS IS THERE AND WHAT
PERCENTAGE YOU ARE APPLYING TO
THAT BASE THAT IS GOING TO BE
TAXED.
I THINK COMPANIES WILL HAVE TO
TAKE A LOOK AT THE WAY THERE
INTERNAL OPERATIONS LOOK AND
LOOK AT THE DEALS THEY HAVE
STRUCK WITH IRISH TAX
AUTHORITIES.
EMILY: APPLE SHARES ENDING TODAY
SLIGHTLY DOWN.
HOW DID ESTERS REACT? ALEX: THEY
ARE RELATIVELY BLASE ABOUT IT.
IT'S 6% OF THEIR CASH RESERVES.
THE THING INVESTORS WANT TO SEE
IS THE ABILITY TO REPATRIATE THE
MONEY TO THE U.S. BECAUSE THEY
WANT TO GET IT IN THE FORM OF
DIVIDENDS AND BUYBACKS.
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD
FOR THEM.
EMILY: OUR BLOOMBERG NEWS

EMILY: EVAN WILLIAMS HAS MADE A
MAJOR ROLE IN SHAPING HOW USERS
X REST THEMSELVES ONLINE, FROM
FOUNDING BLOGGER WHICH HE SOLD
TO GOOGLE, HE FOCUSED ON
PODCASTING AND FROM THERE, A
SIDE PROJECT THAT HE CALLED
TWITTER WAS BORN.
HE REMAINS ON THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS.
HE STARTED MEDIUM AS A WAY TO
PUBLISH POSTS LONGER THAN
TWITTER'S CHARACTER LIMIT.
HERE WITH ME FOR THE HOURS --
THE HOUR, EVAN WILLIAMS.
I WANT TO START WITH MEDIUM
BECAUSE YOU PLAY A TREMENDOUS
ROLE IN HOW WE PUBLISH ONLINE
AND EXPRESS OURSELVES ONLINE.
MEDIUM IS YOUR VISION FOR THE
FUTURE.
GIVE US AN UPDATE ON WHERE IT IS
AND WHERE IT'S GOING.
EVAN: MEDIUM IS A PLACE TO WRITE
STORIES AND IDEAS.
IT'S MEANT TO BE OPEN TO ANYONE
AND ANYONE WHO HAS SOMETHING OF
SAY -- SOMETHING TO SAY OF
SUBSTANCE TO FIND THEIR
AUDIENCE.
IT'S AN A ON BLOGGING OR SOCIAL
MEDIA BUT IT IS FOCUSED ON
THINGS THAT TEND TO BE LONGER.
IT'S USED BY BOTH AMATEURS AND
PROFESSIONALS.
EVERYONE FROM THE PRESIDENT TO
INDIVIDUALS WITH STORIES TO
TELL.
EMILY: PRESIDENT OBAMA, BONO,
HILLARY CLINTON -- YOU HAVE
PUBLISHERS LIKE BILL SIMMONS,
WHAT IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN
AMATEURS, INFLUENCERS AND
PUBLISHERS?
EVAN: WE THINK THE MIX IS
IMPORTANT AND MAKES THE
CONVERSATION BETTER.
THE ENTIRE POINT OF MEDIUM IS,
UNLIKE A STANDALONE WEBSITE, YOU
ARE IN THE MIX.
YOUR IDEAS BOUNCE AROUND WITH
OTHER PEOPLE.
YOU CAN RESPOND AND HIGHLIGHT
AND PEOPLE CAN FIND YOU.
ONE OF OUR MOTTOS IS GREAT IDEAS
CAN COME FROM ANYWHERE.
WHEN IT COMES TO WRITING, THERE
ARE TENS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH
UNIQUE PERSPECTIVES AND IDEAS
AND THE ABILITY TO ARTICULATE
THEM.
WE OFFER A PLACE TO DO THAT.
IT IS WHERE A BUSINESS LEADER
CAN WRITE SOMETHING AND A
CUSTOMER CAN RESPOND.
BECAUSE THERE'S THE DIVERSITY OF
VOICES, YOU GET MUCH MORE
INSIGHT.
EMILY: IT IS BEAUTIFUL, SIMPLE
AND ELEGANT.
WHERE ARE YOU ON MONETIZATION?
EVAN: WE ARE WORKING ON GROWING
THE MONETIZATION PEACE RIGHT
NOW.
REALLY MAKING IT WORK FOR
INDIVIDUALS.
NOW, WE ARE FOCUSED ON ENABLING
PROFESSIONALS WHICH MEANS
GETTING THEM PAID.
BRANDS ARE PUBLISHING AND
WORKING WITH THE PUBLISHERS TO
TELL THEIR STORIES AND GAIN
AUDIENCES TO THE STORIES.
SOME PUBLISHERS ARE IMPLEMENTING
OUR SUBSTITUTION PROGRAM AS WELL
SO YOU CAN CREATE A PAY WALL.
THAT'S LOOKING GOOD BUT IT'S IN
ITS EARLY STAGES.
EMILY: TIM KAINE RESPONDED AND
MITT ROMNEY ANNOUNCED WHY HE'S
NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ON
MEDIUM.
HOW DOES THAT COME ABOUT?
DO YOU HAVE A TEAM OF PEOPLE
TRYING TO GET HILLARY TO POST ON
MEDIUM?
WHAT'S THE PLAY-BY-PLAY?
EVAN: WE HAVE AN OUTREACH TEAM
THAT'S A WHITE LOVE SERVICE TEAM
AND THEY HELP GET THE BALL
ROLLING.
IT HAS TAKEN ON ITS OWN
MOMENTUM.
WHETHER YOU ARE IN DCE OR IN
THAT WORLD, IF YOU WANT TO FIND
IN AUDIENCE, MEDIUM BECOMES THE
DEFAULT FOR THAT.
IT REALLY HAS GOTTEN THIS
MOMENTUM NOW AND PEOPLE FROM
THAT WORLD READ IT.
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,
THERE IS -- YOU GO THERE AND SAY
IT.
EMILY: YOU MENTIONED THERE IS
ONE PERSON WHO HAS NOT POSTED ON
MEDIUM AND THAT IS DONALD TRUMP.
EVAN: WE ARE HAPPILY OPEN TO
WHAT HE WOULD HAVE TO SAY BUT SO
FAR HE HAS NOT CHOSEN TO EXPAND
MUCH BEYOND HIS 140 CHARACTERS
IN WRITING.
EMILY: HE HAS TAKEN FINE
ADVANTAGE OF TWITTER.
HE SEEMS TO PREFER EXPRESSING
HIMSELF IN 140 CHARACTERS.
WHAT HAS THAT BEEN LIKE WATCHING
TRUMP TAKE OFF ON TWITTER?
EVAN: KIND OF THE SAME AS
EVERYONE.
A MIXTURE OF THE WILDERMUTH AND
AND FEAR.
-- BEWILDERMENT AND FEAR.
IT HAS BEEN FASCINATING,
ESPECIALLY MOST RECENT
REVELATION THAT HIS TWEETS WERE,
YOU COULD DISTINGUISH HIS TWEETS
FROM HIS STAFF BY LOOKING AT THE
SOURCE.
YEARS AGO, WHEN WE HELD IN THAT
ABILITY TO SEE THE SOURCE, WE
DID NOT PICTURE THAT RETICULAR
USE CASE BUT I'M GLAD IT'S
THERE.
EMILY: "VANITY FAIR" HAD A
PROVOCATIVE ARTICLE THAT SAID
SILICON VALLEY CREATED DONALD
TRUMP.
DO YOU THINK SILICON VALLEY OR
THAT WITHOUT TWITTER, TRUMP
WOULD BE NOT WHERE HE IS?
EVAN: I WOULD HATE TO US TO TAKE
THE CREDIT OR THE BLAME FOR
THAT.
IT'S A RESULT LARGELY OF OUR
MEDIA ECOSYSTEM WHICH HAS
TREMENDOUSLY GOOD AND BAD
THINGS.
WHEN I STARTED WORKING ON THE
INTERNET, I WAS EXCITED ANYONE
COULD THAT THEIR VOICE OUT THERE
AND I THOUGHT THE WORLD IS GOING
TO BE SMARTER, WISER, WHEN THE
TRUTH IS OUT THERE AND
UNFETTERED, THE REASON I'M STILL
WORKING IN THIS AREA IS THAT I
REALIZE IT NOT AS THE BLAS THAT.
THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF NOISE
HAS NOT MADE US OR IN MANY WAYS,
IT HAS MADE US DUMBER.
THEY'RE SO MUCH WE HAVE TO DO ON
TOP OF THIS SYSTEM TO TAKE FULL
ADVANTAGE AS A SOCIETY, WE STILL
HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.
EMILY: YOU HAVE MONDAY OF
HIGH-PROFILE TECH CEOS SAYING
THAT THEY ARE AGAINST TRUMP.
WHERE DO YOU STAND?
EVAN: I AM FIRMLY AGAINST TRUMP.
EMILY: HOW DO YOU, AS SOMEONE
WHO HAS OLD MULTIPLE PLATFORMS
FOR FREE SPEECH, HOW DO YOU
BALANCE YOUR CLINICAL VIEWS WITH
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO THE
PLATFORM?
WE JUST SAW THIS, IN THE
TRENDING TOPIC SECTION THAT THEY
DEEMPHASIZED CONSERVATIVE
STORIES.
EVAN: I'M NOT UNFRIENDLY AGAINST
ALL REPUBLICANS.
I'M PROUD THAT BOTH ON TWITTER
AND ON MEDIUM, WE HAVE TOLD THAT
FORMS THAT ARE GIVING AN EQUAL
SIDE.
WE HAVE MANY SENATORS AND
CONGRESSPEOPLE AND ABOUT AN EVEN
MIX ON BOTH SIDES.
IN FACT, IN OUR OUTREACH TEAM,
WE EMPLOY AN EQUAL NUMBER OF
PEOPLE WHO REACH OUT TO THE
RIGHT AND LEFT.
THERE'S NOTHING IN HER SYSTEM
THAT BIASES ONE SIDE AGAINST THE
OTHER.
THAT HAS CREATED A HEALTHY
EXCHANGE AND I READ AND
RECOMMEND VIEWPOINTS FROM BOTH
SIDES.
BECAUSE THEY ARE ON THE SAME
FORM, I THINK PEOPLE ARE MORE
OPEN TO THEM.
EMILY: BLOOMBERG HAD A SCOOP
TODAY THAT DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO
START A MEDIA BUSINESS.
EVAN: I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY
SMART OF THEM.
I THINK THERE WILL BE AN
AUDIENCE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
EMILY: HE SEEMS TO BE GETTING A
LOT OF INTEREST.
EVAN: MAYBE HE COULD COHOST.
EMILY: EVAN WILLIAMS, WE WILL BE

MEDIUM HAS BECOME THE PLACE
WHERE PEOPLE POST LONGER AND
IN-DEPTH PIECES -- PRESIDENT
OBAMA, BILL GATES AND BONO ARE
JUST A FEW OF THE PEOPLE WHO
HAVE USED THIS FORUM TO SHARE
THEIR THOUGHTS WITH THE WORLD.
THE FORMER LEADER OF NOW
BANKRUPT GAWKER JUST POSTED HER
THOUGHTS.
WITH US IS THE COFOUNDER OF
MEDIUM AND TWITTER, EVAN
WILLIAMS.
I IS SUPPOSED SHE POSTED THIS ON
MEDIUM BECAUSE THE IDEA IS YOU
CAN'T TAKE IT DOWN.
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON PETER THIEL
VERSUS GAWKER?
IS THAT GOING TOO FAR OR FAIR
PLAY?
EVAN: FOUR GAWKER OR PETER
THIEL?
EMILY: EITHER.
EVAN: IT'S SCARY FOR THE PRESS.
ESPECIALLY IF UNKNOWN SOURCES OF
MONEY ARE FIGHTING YOU.
I WAS NOT A AND OF EVERYTHING
GAWKER DID BUT IN GENERAL, I'M A
FAN OF FREEDOM OF THE PRESS.
I THINK IT IS CRITICAL.
ULTIMATELY, GAWKER SHOULD AVAIL,
BUT IT WOULD BE A BAD THING IF
RANDOM MEDIA SITES CAN BE TAKEN
OUT BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE
WHAT THEY SAY.
EMILY: IT'S A QUESTION YOU DEAL
WITH BEHIND-THE-SCENES -- WHAT
IS FREE SPEECH?
WHAT COUNTS AS FAIR?
WHAT IS GOING TOO FAR?
I'M SURE WHEN YOU STARTED
BLOGGER, THERE WERE TROLLS AND
ONLINE HARASSMENT.
IT SEEMS LIKE NOTHING HAS
CHANGED.
EVAN: IT HAS GOTTEN WORSE, FOR
SURE.
THE EARLY DAYS OF THE INTERNET,
IT WAS A LITTLE BETTER AND WE
FELT LIKE IT'S A BIG CLUB AND IF
YOU ARE THERE, YOU ARE WELCOME
AND WE HAVE DINNER PARTIES WITH
OUR FRONT DOOR OPEN.
IF YOU STOP BY, EVERYONE IS GLAD
TO SEE YOU AND SO MUCH HAS
EVOLVED WITH THAT DEFAULT
FRAMEWORK.
THE IDEA THAT ANYONE CAN JOIN
ANY CONVERSATION IS NOT
SOMETHING WE EXPECT IN THE REAL
WORLD.
BECAUSE SO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS
COME FROM ONLINE, THERE'S A LOT
OF DESIRE TO HOLD ONTO TO THAT
ABILITY AND YET IT CAUSES SO
MUCH PROBLEMS WHEN YOU OPEN IT
UP TO THE MASSIVE SOCIETY.
EMILY: WHY IS IT HARD TO CRACK
DOWN ON ONLINE HARASSMENT AND
QUIET THE TROLLS?
EVAN: BECAUSE THE LINE IS FUZZY.
WHEN YOU DIG IN, IT SEEMS MUCH
EASIER FROM THE OUT SIDE THEN
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DETAILS.
A LOT OF THE RHETORIC WOULD GIVE
YOU THE IMPRESSION THAT TWITTER
OR OTHER SERVICES DON'T DO
ANYTHING.
THERE'S A HUGE TEAM FOCUSED ON
THIS AND DELETE STUFF ALL OF
TIME.
WHAT IS TRICKY IS WHERE THE LINE
IT'S BLURRY AND WE WANT TO
DEFEND FREE SPEECH AND ALLOW THE
PRINCIPLE OF FREE SPEECH, YOU
HAVE TO DEFEND FREE SPEECH
YOU'VE IF YOU DON'T AGREE.
IT'S ALL LEGAL REQUIREMENT
BECAUSE TWITTER IS A PRIVATE
ENTITY, IT IS A VALUE THAT WE
HOLD THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE
TO GIVE OUT THOUGHTS EVEN IF IT
IS UNPOPULAR.
THE POLICIES AND TOOLS ARE
EVOLVING, BUT IT IS NOT A
TRIVIAL ISSUE.
WE ACKNOWLEDGED A COUPLE OF
YEARS AGO AND I THINK EVEN FROM
THE EARLIEST DAYS, WE WOULD HAVE
THOUGHT ABOUT DIFFERENT
ARCHITECTURE HAD WE KNOWN HOW
SEVERE THIS ISSUE WOULD GET.
IT REALLY HAS GOTTEN A LOT WORSE
IN TERMS OF THE VITRIOL AND THE
SEVERITY OF THE ATTACKS PEOPLE
SUFFER.
THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE SERVICE
IS A LOT OF WHAT ALLOWS A LOT OF
GREAT THINGS AND DOES ALLOW THE
BAD THINGS BUT I THINK THERE ARE
THINGS YOU CAN DO.
I MET WITH THE TEAM WORKING ON
THIS AND THERE'S A BUNCH OF
SMART PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE
IMPROVING IT SOON.
EMILY: YOU ARE THE COFOUNDER OF
TWITTER, YOU'VE BEEN THE BIGGEST
CHAMPION OF TWITTER, THIS IS A
COMPANY WITH A MARKET CAP HIGH
OF $20 BILLION AND NOW IT'S $13
BILLION.
DO YOU THINK IT CAN GET BACK TO
THOSE HEIGHTS?
EVAN: I CAN'T MAKE ANY REAL
STATEMENTS BEING A BOARD MEMBER
OF TWITTER.
I THINK ABSTRACTLY SPEAKING,
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY LARGE AND
VALUABLE SERVICE.
THE THING THAT TWITTER PROVIDES,
THE REAL-TIME INFORMATION LAYER
IS VALUABLE AND CAN BE A LOT
MORE VALUABLE.
IT'S A MATTER OF INNOVATION AND
DEVELOPMENT AND THERE'S NOT AN
ASSET LIKE TWITTER IN THE WORLD
IN TERMS OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND
WORLD LEADERS AND ENTERTAINERS
AND THE INFORMATION CREATED ON A
DAILY BASIS.
THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT CAN
COME OUT OF THAT.
I'M AN OPTIMIST IN GENERAL.
EMILY: WHAT IS YOUR FAITH IN
JACK EVAN:?
MY FAITH IS HIGH AND JACK.
I FULLY SUPPORT THEM.
EMILY: I KNOW YOU CAN ONLY GO SO
FAR.
WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF M&A.
DO YOU SEE TWITTER REMAINING AN
INDEPENDENT COMPANY?
EVAN: NO COMMENT ON THAT.
WE ARE IN A STRONG POSITION
RIGHT NOW AND AS A BOARD MEMBER,
WE HAVE TWO CONSIDER ALL THE
OPTIONS.
EMILY: MEDIUM IS ALMOST A
COMPLEMENT TO TWITTER BUT IS
ALMOST THE OPPOSITE OF TWITTER.
IT'S MORE IN-DEPTH.
DO YOU SEE THEM AS POTENTIALLY
OPPOSITE?
EVAN: IN SOME WAYS.
HARD OF MY REASON FOR WORKING ON
MEDIUM IS IN -- WHILE TWITTER
GREW AND FACEBOOK EVOLVED AND
ALL THESE OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA
PLOT FORMS TOOK AN INCREASING
AMOUNT OF ATTENTION, THEY STILL
ALL POINTED TO AND TALKED ABOUT
NONSOCIAL MEDIA.
ARTICLES, TEXT, JOURNALISM WAS
STILL INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND
PEOPLE ARE CONSUMING MORE AND
MORE, BUT IT HASN'T EVOLVED AS
MUCH.
THEY ARE INCREDIBLY
COMPLEMENTARY, EVEN THOUGH THEY
ARE VERY DIFFERENT.
TWITTER IS MORE OF A
DISTRIBUTION VEHICLE FOR MORE
SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT THAN IT IS
SOMEWHERE WHERE YOU EXPAND IDEAS
OR OFFER MORE COMPLEX STORIES.
THE MEDIUM IS COMPLEMENTARY AND
THAT'S THE REASON I WORK ON
MEDIUMS.
EMILY: WE'RE GOING TO TALK MORE
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE INTERNET

EMILY: WELCOME BACK.
WE STILL HERE WITH EVAN
WILLIAMS, COFOUNDER OF TWITTER
AND FOUNDER OF MEDIUM.
WE ARE JOINED BY BRAD STONE.
YOU HAD A HAND IN SHAPING THE
WEB AS WE KNOW IT.
THE GROWTH OF THE INTERNET IS
SOMETHING YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT
AND YOU ARE A MULTI-TIME AUTHOR.
MY FIRST QUESTION, HAVE SOCIAL
NETWORKS BECOME TOO BIG?
EVAN: I DON'T THINK THEY ARE TOO
BIG IN GENERAL.
SCALE IS HARD.
WE'RE NOT USED TO BEING
CONNECTED TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
AND WE'RE NOT USED TO DISCUSSING
THINGS AMONG THE OF PEOPLE OR
PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW.
MANY BASIC SOCIAL NETWORKS HAVE
ALWAYS EXISTED AND THEY HAVE
NEVER BEEN AS BIG AS THEY ARE
ONLINE.
FROM A POWER IN BUSINESS
PERSPECTIVE, SIZE HELPS, THE
DEFENSIVENESS, THE VALUE OF
SOCIAL NETWORKS ROSE WITH THE
SIZE.
BRAD: MORE ADVERTISING DOLLARS
ARE FUNNELING IN AND PEOPLE'S
ATTENTION IS FUNNELING TO THESE
PLATFORMS.
I WONDER ARE WE LOSING SOME OF
THAT WONDERFUL OPENNESS OF THE
INTERNET AND IS THERE A COST TO
THE DEPENDENCE ON A HANDFUL OF
PLATFORMS?
EVAN: THERE IS FOR SURE A COST
AND AS THE INEVITABLE TRAJECTORY
WE ARE ON.
A FEW MAJOR PLATFORMS, IF YOU
ROTTEN IT FROM SOCIAL NETWORKS
TO MEDIA PLATFORMS AND
SYNDICATION PLATFORMS, ALMOST AS
A LAW OF NATURE, IT IS TO
CENTRALIZE -- IT IS GOING TO
CENTRALIZE AND CONSOLIDATE.
EMILY: WHAT ABOUT THE MOBILE WEB
IN PARTICULAR?
THESE ARE THE COMPANIES THAT
DECIDE WHAT APPS WE USE AND IT'S
A SMALL NUMBER THAT WE SPEND A
LOT OF TIME ON.
IS THE INTERNET ACTUALLY
BECOMING SMALLER?
EVAN: IT IS BECOMING MORE
CLOSED, FOR SURE.
ANY OF US WHO DEVELOP SOFTWARE
OR THE INTERNET, THINKING BACK
TO EVEN 10 YEARS, WE WOULD HAVE
HAD TO GET OUR SOFTWARE APPROVED
BEFORE WE RELEASE IT TO
CUSTOMERS AND THAT FEELS LIKE A
STEP ACT WORDS TERMS OF OPENNESS
AND DEVELOPMENT.
IN EXCHANGE, YOU GET
INFRASTRUCTURE AND ALL KINDS OF
THINGS THAT HELP.
BRAD: NOT TO RAISE THE TAR BABY
OF NET NEUTRALITY, BUT YOU HAVE
COMPANIES LIKE T-MOBILE
RELEASING THESE UNLIMITED PLANS
AND THAT RAISES ANOTHER HOST OF
QUESTIONS FOR OUR WE GETTING IN
THE GUISE OF FREE, GETTING
ACCESS TO SOME OF THE INTERNET
BUT NOT ALL OF IT?
EVAN: I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S
GOING TO GO BUT THE IDEA THAT
THIS WAS BUILT AS A HIGHLY
DECENTRALIZED PLATFORM AND WAS
CRUCIAL, YET THE PARADOXES OF
THE GREAT LACE OR -- MOST OF THE
VALUABLE THINGS ON THE INTERNET
ARE CENTRALIZED PLATFORMS OR
MARKET LATE-SEASON AND ONCE YOU
CREATE ONE OF THOSE, YOU GET AN
INCREASE IN YOUR RETURNS.
EMILY: YOU SAY THE INTERNET IS
MORE LIKE TV THAN WE THINK.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
EVAN: MY CURRENT OBSESSION IS
HOW DO WE UP THE QUALITY OF
MEDIA ON THE INTERNET IN THE WAY
TV HAS EVOLVED IN THE LAST
YEARS?
THE FEED WE ARE ALL USED TO IS
LIKE TURNING ON THE TV AND
FLIPPING CHANNELS.
OFTEN LOTS OF GOOD STUFF THAT
YOU WANT, IT'S NOT VERY
INTENTIONAL WHAT YOU CONSUME.
IT'S WHATEVER CATCHES YOUR
ATTENTION AT THE TIME WHEREAS --
NOT JUST LIKE VIDEO, BUT THIS
EXPERIENCE OF SHOW ME SOME
STUFF.
WHEREAS TV HAS EVOLVED AND WE
SIT DOWN AND WE LOOK AT OUR DVR
OR NETFLIX AND WE HAVE A LIMITED
SELECTION OF HIGHLY CURATED
SHOWS.
AS A RESULT, THOSE SHOWS HAVE
GOTTEN HIGHER QUALITY AND TELL
MORE COMPLEX STORIES AND YOU
CONSUME THEM FROM BEGINNING TO
END.
THE BUSINESS MODELS HAVE
IMPROVED AS WELL.
THE MECHANISM MATTERS A LOT.
THE ABILITY FORD DVR'S AND THAT
HAS CHANGED THE BUSINESS MODEL
OF THE CONTENT.
I THINK IT'S EARLY DAYS IN
CONTENT AND MEDIA ON THE
INTERNET AND IF WE CAN INVENT
THE NEW DISTRIBUTION AND
CONSUMPTION MODELS, WE CAN
CHANGE EVERYTHING.
EMILY: DO YOU SEE APPLE, GOOGLE
AND FACEBOOK GETTING BIGGER AND
STRONGER OR WILL OTHER COMPANIES
BREAK THROUGH AND WE JUST CAN'T
IMAGINE IT? EMILY: IN THE LAST
EIGHT YEARS OF THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION, YOU HAD VERY
WEAK ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT.
I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHETHER
THAT CHANGES IN THE NEXT
ADMINISTRATION?
WE'VE SEEN SOME PUSHBACK, EVEN
TODAY IN EUROPE ON LARGE
TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES.
THAT'S PROBABLY A BIG PART OF IT
AND THESE COMPANIES GET MORE AND
MORE SUCCESSFUL AND POWERFUL
BECAUSE PEOPLE LOVE THEIR
SERVICES.
WE ARE IN THE AGE OF THE FEED
BECAUSE PEOPLE LOVE THE FEED.
WE ALL THIS TRAFFIC COMING FROM
THE FACEBOOK'S AND SNAPCHAT'S OF
THE WORLD.
TO THE EXTENT WE BUY NEW MODELS,
COMPANIES LIKE MEDIUM HAS TO
INVENT THINGS THAT HAVE A GRIP.
EMILY: YOU SAY THE INTERNET IS
LIKE A CITY.
BRAD: THERE'S THIS MIGRATION
THAT'S SIMILAR TO THE MIGRATION
TO URBAN AREAS WHICH IS GOING TO
HAPPEN OVER SEVERAL DECADES AND
THE PERCENTAGE OF THE WORLD THAT
LIVES IN URBAN AREAS AND IS
PROJECTED INTO 2050 IS GOING TO
BE A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE.
PEOPLE -- IT'S A TRADE-OFF.
YOU TRADE FLEX ABILITY, YOU
TRADE OPENNESS AND THE ABILITY
TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT ON YOUR
ONLY AN.
IF YOU LIVE IN A CITY WITH
ACCESS TO CULTURE AND IDEAS, THE
SAME THING HAPPENS ONLINE.
THESE COMPANIES BUILD
CONSOLIDATION AND YOU BUMP INTO
PEOPLE AND YOU TRADE THE SAME
THING.
EMILY: EVAN WILLIAMS, COFOUNDER
OF TWITTER AND CEO OF MEDIUM.
BRAD STONE, THANK YOU FOR
STOPPING BY.
I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT ONE
STORY THAT IS OUT OF THIS WORLD
-- SPACEX IS PREPARING TO CROSS
ANOTHER MILESTONE.
THEY ARE PREPARING TO TAKE
FLIGHT WITH ONE OF ITS RECYCLED
ROCKETS.
THEY WILL SEND THEIR INDICATIONS
SATELLITE INTO ORBIT ON A
PREVIOUSLY FLOWN FALCON ROCKET.
THEY HAVE NOT ANNOUNCED WHAT IT
WILL COST, BUT THE PRICE WILL BE
DISCOUNTED.
IT'S A MAJOR PART OF ELON MUSK'S
LAND TO CUT THE COST OF SPACE
TRAVEL AND RE-MARS BY 2018.
TOMORROW, DON'T MISS A
CONVERSATION ON COMMODITIES.
THAT'S NEXT A.M. NEW YORK TIME.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

EMILY: NOW TO A STORY TRENDING
TODAY -- KIM.COM HAS WON THE
RIGHT TO LIVE STREAM HIS APPEAL
AGAINST HIS EXTRADITION TO THE
U.S. 
LIVESTREAM IS ONLINE SHOWING
BECOMING ZEN GOINGS AT THE
COURTHOUSE.
THIS AFTER A NEW ZEALAND JUDGE
RULED THE FOUNDER OF MEGAUPLOAD
CAN STREAM THE CORPORATE
SEEDINGS.
HE'S FACING CONSPIRACY,
RACKETEERING AND MONEY
LAUNDERING CHARGES AND
POTENTIALLY DECADES IN JAIL.
HE TOOK TO TWITTER SAYING I WILL
POST A LIVE STREAMING LINK ASAP.
THIS IS BREAKING NEW GROUND, NEW
ZEALAND AT THE FOREFRONT OF
TRANSPARENT JUSTICE.
TWITTER COFOUNDER EVAN WILLIAMS
IS STILL WITH ME.
SOMETHING ALSO TRENDING ON
TWITTER -- CLASSIC TAGS WHICH
LETS PEOPLE SHARE ADVICE UNDER
THE HASH TAGGED "I TELL MY TEEN
SELF."
I BELIEVE WE HAVE SOME VIDEO OF
YOU FROM THE EARLY DAYS TALKING
ABOUT THE INTERNET.
EVAN: REALLY?
EMILY: THAT'S NOT YOU.
FIRST, GIVEN EVERYTHING YOU HAVE
AND THROUGH, WHAT WOULD YOU TELL
YOUR TEEN SELF?
EVAN: TALK TO THE GIRL.
MOVED TO CALIFORNIA SOONER.
TRUST YOUR GUT.
EMILY: ANYTHING ABOUT STARTING
IT COMPANY?
EVAN: DO THAT.
IT WORKED OUT FAIRLY WELL.
BUT I DID HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH
THAT.
DO MORE SOONER.
EMILY: WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE
FOR ASPIRING ENTREPRENEURS AND
PEOPLE WHO ARE TOO SCARED TO
TAKE THE RISK YOU TOOK?
EVAN: WHAT I USUALLY TELL PEOPLE
WHEN I START TALKING TO THEM IS
SIMPLIFY AND FOCUS.
YOU CAN BREAK ANYTHING DOWN AND
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THE GRAND
VISION BUT IT IS SURPRISING HOW
SUCCESSFUL YOU CAN BE AND HOW
BIG SOMETHING CAN BE IF YOU ZOOM
IN ON IT.
THERE ARE STILL MILLIONS OF
OPPORTUNITIES IN THE WORLD AND
OFTEN, YOU DON'T SEE THAT
BECAUSE YOU ARE LOOKING TO
BROADLY AND IF YOU NARROW YOUR
FOCUS, YOU CAN FIND SURPRISING
WORLD LIKE WE DID WITH TWITTER.
EMILY: WHY DO YOU KEEP CREATING?
WHY AREN'T YOU SITTING ON A
BEACH? WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO ME
QUESTION REQUIRE YOU DOING THE
START OF THING ALL OVER AGAIN?
EVAN: I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS COMPELLED TO WORK ON
MEDIUM BECAUSE THE WORK WASN'T
DONE.
THERE'S STILL SO MUCH POTENTIAL
IN USING THE INTERNET TO HELP
EACH OTHER AND HELP EACH OTHER
WITH IDEAS.
THE ANSWER TO MOST OF OUR
PROBLEMS ARE ALREADY HERE BUT
THEY ARE IN SOMEONE ELSE'S HEAD.
THEY DON'T HAVE THIS GREAT
SYSTEM FOR GETTING IT OUT OF
YOUR HEAD.
EMILY: YOU CAN FIND THAT VIDEO
OF EVAN WILLIAMS WHEN HE WAS
15-YEAR-OLD TALKING ABOUT THE
INTERNET.
EVAN: YOU DON'T HAVE TO.
