TURNING SOUR.
APPLE'S TAX ARRANGEMENTS -- TAX
ARRANGEMENT IN IRELAND AS THE EU
PREPARES TO HANDLE THE BIGGEST
TAX PENALTY EVER.
WHO HACKED THE ELECTION?
THE FBI INVESTIGATES HACKS AT A
TWO STATE ELECTION BOARDS.
WE WILL BREAK THE LATEST
DEVELOPMENTS DOWN.
AND IT'S GO TIME FOR COMMERCIAL
DRONE STRAIGHT WE WILL DISCUSS
THE LATEST REGULATION AS
AMERICAN BUSINESSES TAKE TO THE
SKIES.
BUT FIRST, TO OUR LEAD.
SEE YOU ON THE SEVENTH, APPLE
OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGES ITS
HIGHLY ANTICIPATED EVENT NEXT
WEEK.
EVERY SPECK OF THE INVITATION IS
UNDER SCRUTINY FOR POSSIBLE
HINTS OF WHICH PRODUCT UPGRADE
MAY BE REVEALED.
NEXT YOU RUN HER RATION IPHONES
AT APPLE WATCHES ALSO ON OUR
RADAR.
ANOTHER STORY LOOMING LARGE OVER
THE MOST VALUABLE PUBLIC COMPANY
IN THE WORLD, EUROPEAN
REGULATORS COULD ANNOUNCE AS
EARLY AS TUESDAY THAT APPLE IS
ON THE HOOK FOR UP TO $19
BILLION IN TAXES, EUROPE'S
LARGEST PENALTY EVER.
THIS WOULD CULMINATE A
THREE-YEAR INVESTIGATION INTO
WHETHER IRELAND GAVE APPLE A
SWEETHEART DEAL IN RETURN FOR
CREATING JOBS THERE.
JOINING ME TO DISCUSS, A SENIOR
REACH -- RESEARCH ANALYST,
UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA PROFESSOR,
AN EXPERT IN INTERNATIONAL TAX
LAWS, AND R BLOOMBERG REPORTER
WHO COVERS APPLE WITH ME IN THE
STUDIO.
ALEX, $19 BILLION, I BELIEVE
THAT'S WHAT A J.P. MORGAN
ANALYST CAME UP WITH.
VASTLY DIFFERENT.
WHAT ARE WE LIKELY TO SEE HERE?
>> THIS $19 BILLION FIGURE HAS
BEEN AROUND FOR A COUPLE MONTHS.
THE IRISH TIMES LIKELY REVISE
THE FIGURE UP A BIT.
WE THINK IT WILL BE IN THE
HANDFUL OF BILLIONS, POSSIBLY.
SOURCES AT THIS STAGE, WE HAVE
TO SEE WHAT THE ACTION NUMBER IS
WHEN WE WAKE UP TOMORROW ON THE
WEST COAST.
EMILY: HOW ARE YOU MODELING THIS
OUT?
WHAT IS LIKELY SCENARIO?
>> THE WORSE CASE AND AREA IS
$19 BILLION, IF THAT HAPPENS, IT
IS ABOUT 12% OF THE AVAILABLE
CASH FOR APPLE.
THE NUMBER IS A HUGE NUMBER, BUT
SOMETHING INVESTORS DON'T GIVE
APPLE MUCH CREDIT FOR THEIR CASH
ANYWAY.
IN SOME RESPECTS, IT'S A GREAT
THING TO WATCH BUT REALLY
DOESN'T IMPACT THE VALUATION ON
THE STORY.
THAT'S HOW WE WOULD THINK ABOUT
IT, WE ARE PLAYING FOR THE
WORST-CASE AND THINKING IT IS A
12% HIT TO THEIR CASH.
EMILY: YOU ARE SAYING THAT
WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS UNLIKELY.
WHY?
>> A BIG ISSUE IS IF THE
EUROPEANS PLAY HARDBALL TOO MUCH
, IT'S GOING TO DETER APPLE AND
OTHER COMPANIES FROM REPORTING
ANY TAXABLE INCOME IN EUROPE.
ONE ANALOGY WOULD BE IN IOWA
CORN FARMER WHO FOLLOWS HIS CORN
TO MEXICO, IF THE MEXICANS TRY
AND TAX THE IOWA CORN FARMER,
WHAT'S THE JUSTIFICATION FOR
THAT.
THERE'S AN ANALOGY HERE, WHY ARE
THE EUROPEANS TAXING THE INCOME
OF AN AMERICAN CORPORATION?
EMILY: ON THAT NOTE, THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT HAS STEPPED UP ITS
RHETORIC IN DEFENSE OF APPLE.
TALKING ABOUT IRELAND BEING A
SUPER NATIONAL TAX AUTHORITY,
MAYBE INDICATING THEY ARE
OVERSTEPPING THEIR BOUNDS.
THIS ISSUE OF WHETHER U.S.
COMPANIES HAVE HAD TAX HAVENS IN
EUROPE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A
LONG TIME, AND DEFRAUDING THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT OF BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS.
>> IT'S NOT AS THOUGH THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WANT APPLE TO
PAY TAX.
HE WANTS IT TO PAY ITS TAX HERE
IN THE U.S.
THAT IS IS WHY IT IS HARD
FALLING IN THE AMERICAN SENSE
AGAINST THE EUROPEAN AUTHORITIES
AND AGAINST IRELAND, BECAUSE IT
WANTS THAT MONEY TO GO INTO U.S.
COFFERS.
EMILY: WHAT EXACTLY IS YOUR READ
ON THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION OF
HOW SERIOUS IT CAN BE FOR APPLE?
AND NOT JUST APPLE, BUT OTHER
U.S. TECH COMPANIES.
>> FROM A VALUATION PERSPECTIVE
ON THE SCALE OF 1 TO 10, 10
BEING REALLY BAD, IT'S PROBABLY
A 2 OR 3.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL
IMPACT SOME OF THEIR CASH.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT GETTING
CASH BACK TO THE U.S.
THAT'S THE AND GOAL ULTIMATELY
FOR APPLE, AND THERE NEEDS TO BE
SOME SORT OF TAG FOR IT.
THIS IS 2 OR 3 IN TERMS OF
SEVERITY.
ULTIMATELY THEY WILL HAVE SOME
SMALL FINE AND HOPEFULLY IN THE
NEXT PRESIDENTIAL CYCLE WE WILL
HAVE SOME TAX HOLIDAY WHERE
APPLICANTS WILL BRING IT ACT MAY
BE AT 20%, -- BACK MAYBE A 20%,
SOMETHING MORE REASONABLE.
EMILY: THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
HAS FOR SOME COMPANIES TO THE
GOVERNMENT OF BELGIUM, THE
GOVERNMENT OF THE NETHERLANDS.
WHAT SORT OF CASCADING ISSUES
COULD YOU SEE AFTER WE GET THIS
DECISION FROM THE EUROPEAN
COMMISSION?
>> ONE ISSUE IS THAT ANY TAXES
PAID IN EUROPE ARE A CREDIT
AGAINST U.S. TAXES.
THERE IS COMMENTED ABOUT
DEFRAUDING THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.
I THINK THAT'S TOO STRONG.
THIS IS TAX DEFERRAL.
ANY TAXES PAID IN EUROPE WOULD
BE A CREDIT AGAINST FUTURE U.S.
TAXES, AND THAT'S ONE REASON THE
U.S. GOVERNMENT ISN'T IN FAVOR
OF APPLE PAYING MORE TAXES IN
EUROPE BECAUSE EVENTUALLY IT'S
GOING TO RESULT IN LESS TAXES
PAID IN THE UNITED STATES.
EMILY: "THE FINANCIAL TIMES"
REPORTING THAT MARGARET FESTER
-- MARGARET FESTER HAS HANDED
OUT A 130 PAGE JUDGMENT TO THE
ORGANIZATION, CALLING THIS
ILLEGAL.
SHE HAS TAKEN A VERY STRONG
ANTI-COMPETITION STANCE, AND A
LOT OF U.S. EXECUTIVES,
INCLUDING THE CHAIRMAN OF
ALPHABET, HAS EXPLAINED THAT
EUROPE IS GETTING MORE AND MORE
DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH.
HOW DO YOU SEE THIS PROGRESSING?
>> YOU ARE GENERALLY -- IT IS A
DIFFICULT SITUATION GENERALLY
BECAUSE OF BREXIT TRADED THERE'S
AN ELEMENT OF TRYING TO ENSURE
THAT EUROPE RETAINS CONTROL OF
ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AREAS OF
POLICY.
TAX IS ONE OF THEM.
TRYING TO ENSURE THAT IT DOESN'T
DISINTEGRATE IN A REGULATORY
SENSE.
CENTRALIZING POWER AND STEPPING
AUTHORITY FOR EACH COMMISSIONER
-- THERE IS CERTAINLY AN ELEMENT
OF LIKE STAMPING HER AUTHORITY
ON THE REMIT.
EMILY: COULD USE A BROADER
INTERNATIONAL TAX REFORM AS A
RESULT OF THIS?
>> IT'S POSSIBLE.
ONE ANALOGY HERE IS THIS IS AN
INTRA-EUROPEAN ISSUE, JUST AS
FOR INSTANCE ILLINOIS OFFERED
TAX INCENTIVES TO GET GOING TO
RELOCATE THERE HAD -- BOEING TO
RELOCATE THEIR HEADQUARTERS TO
ILLINOIS.
PARTLY THE EUROPEAN UNION IS
COMPLAINING THAT IRELAND IS
ASKING APPLE AND OTHER COMPANIES
TO PAY A LOWER TAX RATE THAN
GERMANY OR FRANCE.
SO, PARTLY THAT'S WHAT THIS IS
ALL ABOUT.
EMILY: ANY CHANCE APPLE WOULD
ACTUALLY EVER LEAVE IRELAND?
>> NO, I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN HERE IS THERE'S GOING TO
BE SOME TWEAK IN TERMS OF HOW
THEY CHARGE U.S. COMPANIES.
THEY WILL PROBABLY STILL DO SOME
THINGS THROUGH IRELAND AND A
YEAR FROM NOW WILL HAVE A HIGHER
TAX RATE AND MOVE FORWARD.
>> THE ONE THING IT POINTS OUT
FROM A BROADER EUROPEAN LEVEL IS
THE DIFFICULTY YOU HAVE IN THE
EUROPEAN UNION, THERE ARE SO
MANY DIFFERENT FISCAL REGIMES
ACROSS THE REGION, AND THAT
POINTS TO ONE OF THE BIG
PROBLEMS WITH THE WHOLE
ORGANIZATION, IT MAKES IT HARD
TO HAVE ANY SENSE OF
CONSISTENCY.
EMILY: ALEX WEBB COVERS APPLE.
THANK YOU.
GENE MUNSTER, PIPER JAFFRAY
GREAT YOU ARE STICKING WITH ME.
J RITTER, UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,
PROFESSOR OF FINANCE.
THANK YOU AS WELL.

EMILY: APPLES SEPTEMBER 7
PRODUCT EVENT IS NOW CONFIRMED.
THE COMPANY SENT OUT THESE
DIGITAL SAVE THE DATES AND AS
USUAL, IT SET THE INTERNET
ABLAZE WITH SPECULATION.
THE OUT OF FOCUS COLORED LIGHTS
IN THE BACKGROUND AND THE USE OF
THE WORD SEE IN THE TEXT LED
MANY TO BELIEVE THAT WE WILL
HEAR ABOUT CAMERA UPDATES.
STILL WITH US, OUR BLOOMBERG
NEWS REPORTER MARKET HERMAN.
A HANDFUL OF SCOOPS ABOUT WHAT
TO EXPECT IN THE LEADING UP TO
THIS.
THE OUT OF FOCUS LIGHTS, DEPTH
OF FIELD CAMERA TECHNOLOGY,
IPHONE SEVEN ON SEPTEMBER 7.
ANY HINTS THERE?
>> I AGREE WITH YOU.
THOSE OUT OF FOCUS BUBBLES ARE
PRETTY INDICATIVE OF CAMERA
TALK.
THE WORD SEE, I THINK THERE'S A
COUPLE OTHER THINGS GOING ON
THERE.
THERE'S TWO OF THE DOTS OR
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THEM
THAT ARE REALLY MORE IN FOCUS
THAN THE REST, THEY ARE RIGHT
NEXT TO EACH OTHER.
IT SORT OF LOOKS LIKE THE DUAL
CAMERA SET UP WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT ON THE LARGER OF THE TWO
MODELS, AND THE ROUND BUTTONS
ARE INDICATIVE OF THE SHAPE OF
THE HOME BUTTON.
WHEN APPLE ANNOUNCED THE TOUCH
ID, BACK IN 2013, THE INVITATION
LOOKED PRETTY SIMILAR AND PEOPLE
REALIZED AFTER, THOUGH CIRCLES
ARE IN REFERENCE TO THAT HOME
BUTTON.
WE ARE HERE AND THAT THE HOME
BUTTON ON THIS YEAR'S MODEL WILL
BE PRESSURE SENSITIVE.
MAYBE IT'S INDICATING THAT AS
WELL.
EMILY: YOU HAVE TAKEN A MUCH
CLOSER LOOK AT THIS THAN ANYBODY
ELSE I'VE HEARD FROM.
AS YOU REPORTED, WE ARE
EXPECTING DUAL CAMERA PROCESSING
ON THE NEW IPHONE.
BASICALLY TWO CAMERAS THAT MERGE
TWO PHOTOS INTO ONE PHOTO.
TELL US WHAT TO EXPECT.
I KNOW YOU'VE BASICALLY REPORTED
OUT THE ENTIRE EVENT.
BUT AS OF NOW, WHERE DOES IT
STAND?
>> TO RECAP, WE ARE HEARING
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF IOS AND
WATCH OS TALKS.
THEY WILL BE INTRODUCING THE NEW
IPHONE.
MAYBE THEY WILL CALL FOR 7.
MAYBE THEY WILL CALL IT THE SE.
DESIGN WILL LOOK FAIRLY SIMILAR
TO THE IPHONE 6S AND IPHONE 6.
IT WILL HAVE A PRESSURE
SENSITIVE HOME BUTTON, WHICH
WILL VIBRATE IN REACTION TO HOW
HARD YOU PRESS ON IT.
THERE WILL BE THE NEW CAMERA
SYSTEM, WHICH HAS FAR BETTER
ZOOM AND A MUCH FASTER PROCESSOR
WHICH WORKS HAND-IN-HAND WITH
THE NEW CAMERA.
THERE WILL ALSO BE A NEW APPLE
WATCH.
HEALTH TRACKING FEATURES AS WELL
AS GPS FOR MORE ACCURATE
RUNNING.
EMILY: I'M SURE YOU HAVE BEEN
PAYING ATTENTION TO SOME OF
MARK'S STORIES.
YOU ALSO GET YOUR OWN SOURCES.
DOES THIS RING TRUE TO WHAT YOU
ARE EXPECTING, YOU IPHONES, NEW
APPLE WATCHES, NOT HUGE DESIGN
CHANGES, BUT NEW FEATURES THAT
MARK JUST MENTIONED?
>> MARKET COVERED IT ALL.
-- MARK COVERED IT ALL.
THE HEADPHONE JACK GETTING
REMOVED -- I DON'T THINK THAT
WILL CAUSE ANYBODY TO BUY AN
IPHONE.
IT'S ONE OF THOSE SECOND OR
THIRD LEVEL UPDATES.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THERE IS
SOME IMPORTANT THINGS YOU CAN DO
WITH JUST A BETTER CAMERA.
IT CAN BE ANYTHING FROM JUST HOW
YOU TAKE PICTURES AND VIDEOS TO
THIS IDEA OF A DEVICE FOR
AUGMENTED REALITY, WHICH THE
WHOLE POKEMON THEME IS PLAYING
INTO.
THE GROUNDWORK FOR SOMETHING A
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN MIGHT BE AT
FIRST BLUSH.
EMILY: HOW ARE YOU MODELING OUT
A POTENTIAL BOOST IN SALES HERE?
OBVIOUSLY NO MAJOR DESIGN
CHANGES.
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT NOT LIKE THE
FACT THAT THERE'S NO HEADPHONE
JACK.
HOW MANY NEW IPHONES ARE THEY
ACTUALLY GOING TO SELL AS A
RESULT OF THESE UPDATES IN THE
FOURTH ORDER?
-- QUARTER?
>> WE THINK OF THIS AS A FOUR
QUARTER UPDATE.
IN TOTAL WE THINK THEY WILL SELL
235 MILLION PHONES OVER THE NEXT
YEAR.
TO PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE,
THIS WILL BE THE BIGGEST CYCLE,
THE BIGGEST WAVE OF PEOPLE WITH
OLD PHONES COMING INTO A CYCLE.
WE ESTIMATE THERE'S 275 MILLION
PEOPLE WHO HAVE PHONES THAT ARE
TWO YEARS OLD OR OLDER.
IN SOME WAYS, THIS IS NOT A VERY
EXCITING IPHONE UPGRADE.
THAT POOL OF REALLY OLD PHONES
SHOULD POWER THAT THROUGH.
WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE NUMBERS,
WE GO FROM DOWN ABOUT 10% TO 15%
YEAR-OVER-YEAR TO UP ABOUT 10%
TO 15%.
YOU SHOULD SEE A DRAMATIC SWING
BACK IN TERMS OF THAT VERY TOUGH
IPHONE 6S CYCLE.
EMILY: WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY
ARE WORKING TOWARDS BUILDING OUT
THEIR SOFTWARE AND SERVICES, BUT
YOU STILL REPORTED SOME NEW
HARDWARE ENHANCEMENTS COMING TO
THE IPAD.
TELL US ABOUT THAT.
>> THESE AREN'T LIKELY TO BE
SHOWN AT THIS EVENT ON SEPTEMBER
7, BUT APPLES WORKING I BUNCH OF
NEW MAC RELATED PRODUCTS AND NEW
IPAD FEATURES.
STARTING WITH THE MAC, THEY ARE
WORKING ON THE SIGNIFICANT MAC
PRO UPDATE WE REPORTED ON
EARLIER THIS MONTH WITH A THIN
DIGITAL SCREEN WITH THE BUTTONS
ON THE KEYBOARD THE CHANGE BASED
IN WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
THAT WILL BE A BIG UPDATE FOR
THE HIGH-TECH CROWD.
WE'RE ALSO HEARING FASTER MACBO
OK AIRS.
ALSO, APPLE IS COLLABORATING
WITH LG ELECTRONICS OUT OF SOUTH
KOREA ON A NEW MONITOR.
THIS MONITOR WOULD BE 5K, SEVEN
TIMES THE RESOLUTION IN THE SAME
AMOUNT OF SPACE AS YOUR TYPICAL
1080P TELEVISION.
SO, THOSE ARE GOING TO BE BIG
UPDATES ON THE MAC SIDE.
EMILY: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR
THE BOTTOM LINE?
IPAD SALES HAVE NOT BEEN GROWING
THE WAY THEY WERE.
MACBOOK SALES HAVE BEEN
HEALTHIER THAN MANY EXPECTED.
WHAT DO YOU SEE?
>> I THINK JUST DON'T OVERTHINK
IT.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS GOING TO
IMPROVE NICELY.
WE TALK ABOUT A 15% REVENUE
BOOST FROM NEXT TO NEXT YEAR,
AND EARNINGS SHOULD OUTPACE THAT
SLIGHTLY.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS
STILL ALL ABOUT THE IPHONE AND
THESE OTHER PRODUCTS ARE
COLLECTIVELY 35% OF THE
BUSINESS.
IT'S ABOUT THE IPHONE, THE
IPHONE SHOULD HAVE A GOOD CYCLE,
AND IF WE WERE WRONG AND WE BLOW
IT ON THIS ONE, WE SHOULD CATCH
UP AND HAVE AN EVEN BETTER CYCLE
IN 2017 WITH THE ANNIVERSARY
EDITION.
EMILY: ANY POSSIBLE SURPRISES?
WHAT COULD THAT ONE MORE THING
BE?
>> I THINK YOU'VE DONE A GREAT
JOB REPORTING ON ALL THE
FEATURES ON THIS.
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE
DIFFICULT TO BE SURPRISED.
MAYBE ONE OTHER THING MAY BE ON
THE CONTENT SIDE, SOME NEW
PARTNERSHIP THERE, BUT THAT'S A
STRETCH.
EMILY: MARK, ANYTHING WE DON'T
KNOW?
MARK: I DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE
ON ANYTHING WE HAVEN'T REPORTED.

JAY BREGMAN.
THE COMPANY OFFERS ON-DEMAND
DRONE INSURANCE.

ALAN, LAY OUT THE NEW RULES AND
HOW IT WILL IMPACT USERS AS OF
NOW.
ALAN: BEFORE YOU COULD FLY A
DRONE COMMERCIALLY, BUT YOU HAD
TO GET A SPECIAL EXEMPTION.
IT INITIALLY TOOK QUITE A WHILE.
YOU HAD TO BE A LICENSED PILOT.
NOW YOU CAN JUST DO IT AS A
MATTER OF COURSE.
YOU HAVE TO GET A LICENSE, BUT
IT'S MUCH EASIER.
YOU HAVE TO PASS A KNOWLEDGE
TEST.
AS YOU SAID, 3000 PEOPLE SIGNED

IT'S DAYTIME ONLY AT LOW
ALTITUDE.
OTHERWISE IT'S REALLY OPENING UP
TO A LOT MORE PEOPLE.
EMILY: JAY, WHAT DO YOU LIKE
ABOUT THESE NEW RULES AND WHAT
DON'T YOU LIKE?
JAY: WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THESE NEW
RULES IS THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME
TODAY YOU CAN GO INTO AN APPLE
STORE, BY A PHANTOM 4, TAKE A
TEST AT ONE OF 600 TEST CENTERS,
GET FITTED SIMILAR TO TSA PRE,
GET INSURANCE, AND GET YOUR
CERTIFICATE TO BE A REMOTE
PILOT, AND MAKE THE MONEY BACK
IT COSTS YOU TO BUY THAT DRONE
AND PROBABLY A NUMBER OF WEEKS.
THAT IS REALLY EXCITING FOR AN
INDUSTRY.
EMILY: IS THERE ANY AREA IN
WHICH YOU WISH THESE RULES WENT
FURTHER OR ANYTHING YOU DISLIKE
ABOUT THEM?
JAY: OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT THEIR NERVOUSNESS
AROUND A WAIVER PROCESS.
ALMOST EVERY PROVISION OF THIS
NEW RULE HAS A -- THE ABILITY TO
SUBMIT A WAIVER ONLINE THAT YOU
SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO FLY,
FOR EXAMPLE, NEAR A CERTAIN
AIRPORTS, OR OTHER TYPES OF
CONDITIONS THAT ARE NORMALLY
PROHIBITED.
THEY ARE A BIT NERVOUS ABOUT HOW
THAT PROCESS IS GOING TO WORK
AND HOW MUCH TIME IT'S GOING TO
TAKE, BUT TIME WILL TELL.
EMILY: TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
RULES FOR HOBBYISTS, OR THE LACK
THEREOF.
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, IF YOU ARE I
WANT TO BUY A DRONE AND USE IT
FOR FUN, WE DON'T REALLY HAVE
ANY RULES TO FOLLOW.
ALAN: YES AND NO.
THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC RULES.
YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW THE
SAFETY REQUIREMENTS OF A
COMMUNITY OR ORGANIZATION.
BASICALLY WHAT THAT MEANS IS,
VERY MUCH SIMILAR TO THIS
COMMERCIAL RULE, YOU ARE NOT
SUPPOSED TO FLY OVER PEOPLE, YOU
ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO GO TOO HIGH,
YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO GO NEAR
AIRPORTS, ETC.
THERE ARE CERTAINLY QUESTIONS
ABOUT HOW WELL THAT IS ENFORCED.
WE HAVE SEEN HUNDREDS OF REPORTS
OF DRONES FLYING NEAR PLANES AND
WHATNOT.
ESSENTIALLY, THE RULES ARE VERY
SIMILAR.
EMILY: I WAS SPEAKING TO THE
SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION,
ANTHONY FOXX, LAST WEEK, ABOUT
THIS VERY ISSUE AND THE FACT
THAT OUR RULES FOR HOBBYISTS
COULD POTENTIALLY GO FURTHER.
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHETHER
MORE REGULATION IS NEEDED IN
THAT AREA, OR WHAT?
JAY: WE THINK MORE EDUCATION IS
NEEDED.
REALLY IT'S ABOUT LETTING PEOPLE
KNOW WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT BE
DOING RATHER THAN ANY FORM OF
REGULATION AGAINST THEM, AND
THAT SEEMS TO BE WORKING VERY
WELL.
REALLY MAKING SURE THERE IS
MATERIAL IN EVERY BOX TO LET
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY SHOULD AND
SHOULD NOT BE DOING.
EMILY: TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT
SECRETARY FOX HAD TO SAY ABOUT
THESE NEW RULES AND WHAT SORT OF
INDUSTRY THEY COULD HELP OPEN UP
WHEN IT COMES TO DRONES.
TAKE A LISTEN.
>> IT WILL REALLY OPEN THE DOOR
TO MANY, MANY MORE COMMERCIAL
USES.
ON THE OTHER HAND, AS WE HAVE
COMMERCIAL USES, THE HOBBYISTS,
AIRPLANES, THE INTEGRATION OF
ALL THOSE DIFFERENT USES INTO A
SINGLE SYSTEM IS GOING TO BE THE
MOST COMPLICATED PART OF THIS.
EMILY: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE
INDUSTRIES THAT THIS WILL AFFECT
MOST.
THERE IS BEEN A LOT OF TALK
ABOUT AGRICULTURE,
TRANSPORTATION.
WHAT DO YOU SEE?
ALAN: ON THE GROUND, IMAGING IS
THE NUMBER ONE VERTICAL.
THAT WOULD BE THINGS LIKE REAL
ESTATE PHOTOGRAPHY, EVENT
PHOTOGRAPHY, WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHY
.
ANYBODY WHO'S A PHOTOGRAPHY IS
NOW BASICALLY A DRONE
PHOTOGRAPHER, AND PROBABLY WILL
BE GOING OUT TO GET A PART 107
LICENSE.
THE REMAINING LARGE AREAS ARE
INSPECTIONS, AND THAT COULD MEAN
ANYTHING FROM ROOF INSPECTIONS
TO SELL TOWER INSPECTIONS TO ANY
OTHER NUMBER OF THINGS PEOPLE
EXPECTED WITH HUMAN BEINGS THAT
ARE MORE EFFICIENT AND SAFELY
DONE WITH DRONES.
EMILY: WHAT ABOUT AMAZON?
HOW FAR OFF IS AN AMAZON DRONE,
DELIVERING MY PACKAGES TO MY
DOORSTEP?
>> AMAZON IS DOING MOST OF ITS
TESTING IN CAMBRIDGE AND THE
U.K. RIGHT NOW.
WE DON'T KNOW HOW FAR THEY HAVE
GOTTEN WITH IT.
FROM A REGULATORY POINT OF VIEW,
THERE ARE SOME STUMBLING BLOCKS
INSIDE DEPARTMENT 107 REGULATION
THAT THEY, GOOGLE AND OTHERS
WISH COULD HAVE GONE FURTHER.
WHICH IS REALLY HAVE TO SEE HOW
THE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPS AND HOW
THE PROCESS DEVELOPS AROUND
THESE DELIVERIES.
EMILY: ALAN, AS THE PERSON
REPORTING ON THESE ISSUES, WHAT
DO YOU THINK IS THE NEXT
FRONTIER, THE NEXT STORY, THE
NEXT DEVELOPMENT WHEN IT COMES
TO DRONES AND DRONES REGULATION?
ALAN: IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE
SEEING A CRITICAL MASS HERE OF
CHANGE.
WE ARE GOING TO SEE BY THE END
OF THE YEAR RULES THAT WILL
ALLOW DRONES TO FLY DIRECTLY
OVER PEOPLE.
IT WILL BE RELATIVELY SIMPLE AT
FIRST, COVERING THE DRONE WITH
HOME SO IF IT FALLS HE WILL NOT
HURT ANYBODY.
THE NEXT STEP WILL BE TO GIVE
BROADER PERMISSION TO FLY LONG
DISTANCES, SO REAL ROADS, POWER
COMPANIES WANT TO BE ABLE TO FLY
THESE THINGS MILES AND MILES
OVER INFRASTRUCTURE TO INSPECT
THEM AND USE VIDEO LINKS.
ONCE THAT HAPPENS, I REALLY
THINK WE WILL SEE SOME
TREMENDOUS GROWTH, AND THEN
AFTER THAT, PROBABLY THESE
DELIVERIES WE ARE TALKING ABOUT.
EMILY: BLOOMBERG NEWS AVIATION
REPORTER AND VERIFY CEO JAY
BREGMAN, OFFERING ON-DEMAND
DRONE INSURANCE.
THANK YOU BOTH FOR JOINING US.
A STORY WE ARE WATCHING,
E-REGULATORS RAISING CONCERNS
OVER WHATSAPP PRIVACY CHANGES.
THE FACEBOOK OWNED MESSAGING
SERVICE WOULD ALLOW, ONCE
UPDATED, TO BE USED FOR
ADVERTISING AND WOULD ALLOW
BUSINESSES TO REACH ITS MORE
THAN ONE BILLION USERS.
EU REGULATORS REACTED TODAY BY

NEED TO REMAIN IN CHARGE OF

ITALIAN AND BRITISH PRIVACY

REPORTS OF UBER SHUTTING OUT

FIAT AND SAMSUNG DISCUSS A
POSSIBLE DEAL.
♪
EMILY: A STORY WE'RE WATCHING IS
A PARTNERSHIP BREWING BETWEEN
FEAR CHRYSLER AND SAMSUNG?
THE ITALIAN CARMAKER IS LOOKING
FOR A TECH TIE UP SO IT DOESN'T
GET LEFT HIND IN THE RACE FOR
SELF DRIVING CARS.
IN RECENT MONTHS WE HAVE SEEN
FIAT CHRYSLER PURSUING TALKS
WITH APPLE, GOOGLE, UBER, AND
AMAZON.
HERE IS HOW THE CEO DESCRIBED
HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH SAMSUNG
CALMEST EKING WITH BLOOMBERG TV
IN ROME.
SERGIO: WE HAVE A VERY GOOD
RELATIONSHIP WITH SAMSUNG, BOTH
AS A SUPPLIER AND POTENTIAL
STRATEGIC PARTNER.
WHAT I DID SAY WHEN I WAS IN
STERLING YESTERDAY IS THAT THE
OPPORTUNITY IS AN OPPORTUNITY
THAT HAS BEEN LOOKED AT BY A
VARIETY OF PEOPLE.
I THINK IT HAS STRATEGIC VALUE
TO US.
EMILY: AS WE PREVIOUSLY
REPORTED, SAMSUNG IS IN ADVANCED
TALKS WITH THE AT TO BUY SOME OR
ALL OF THE AUTOMAKERS CAR PARTS
BUSINESS.
ANALYSTS SAY A DEAL INVOLVING A
RALLY COULD BECOME THE BASIS FOR
FIAT TO DEVELOP SELF DRIVING
CARS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH A
TECH.COMPANY
-- TECH COMPANY.
SOME RIVALRY BREWING IN SILICON
VALLEY.
UBER IS REPORTEDLY BLOCKING A
SENIOR ALPHABET EXECUTIVE FROM
ATTENDING THE STARTUPS TOWARD
MEETINGS.
UBER IS SAID TO BE KEEPING
INFORMATION FROM A BOARD
OBSERVER AND EXECUTIVE AT
ALPHABETS VENTURE-CAPITAL ARM,
GOOGLE VENTURES.
THE DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS
MOUNTING TENSION BETWEEN THE TWO
COMPANIES.
UNGER HAS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED
THAT GOOGLE HAS ITS OWN RIGHT
HEALING AVENUE IN DEVELOPMENT, A
PROJECT THAT DOVETAILS WITH THE
SEARCH GIANT'S DRIVERLESS CAR
AMBITIONS.
IF GOOGLE WERE TO LAUNCH SUCH A
SERVICE, IT WOULD LIKELY COMPETE
DIRECTLY WITH UBER.
HERE TO GIVE US ALL THE DETAILS
IS OUR BLOOMBERG REPORTER, ERIC
NEWCOMER.
THERE ARE NEW REPORTS THAT
GOOGLE'S CHIEF LEGAL COUNSEL
ISN'T EVEN ALLOWED INTO THE
BOARD MEETING.
WHAT'S NEW?
>> WE HAVE KNOWN GOGLE-UBER --
GOOGLE-UBER FRENEMY STATUS FOR
A WHILE.
WE HAVE KNOWN GOOGLE VENTURES,
THE INVESTOR PART OF GOOGLE, HAS
KEPT ITS DISTANCE FROM UBER.
NOW WE KNOW THAT UBER IS SAYING,
ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION,
YOU NEED TO NOT COME TO OUR
BOARD MEETINGS.
EMILY: GOOGLE VENTURES INVESTED
IN UBER EARLY ON.
IT MAY NOT HAVE SEEMED EARLY AT
THE TIME BUT NOW WE ARE NEAR $70
BILLION VALUATION.
THEY HAVE CERTAIN INFORMATION.
WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE RIGHTS,
NOW THAT THOSE TWO COMPANIES ARE
GOING HEAD-TO-HEAD,
INCREASINGLY.
ERIC: THE IMPORTANT THING HERE,
IT'S ALL ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS.
THERE ARE LOTS OF INVESTORS WITH
RIGHTS TO INFORMATION, BUT AT
THE END OF THE DAY THEY REALLY
CARE ABOUT WHAT UBER EXECS THINK
ABOUT THEM AND THEY ARE NOT
GOING TO PUSH FOR --
I THINK YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
THOSE SORTS OF THINGS AS
NEGOTIATED AND SENSITIVE.
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE FULL
VISIBILITY INTO WHAT EXACTLY IS
GOING ON THERE.
EMILY: THE INFORMATION REPORTING
THAT DAVID CRANE, NEW HEAD OF
GV, THEY ARE WITHHOLDING
INFORMATION FROM HIM.
GOOGLE, WAZE IS GOTTEN INTO
RIDESHARING AND CARPOOLING.
UBER IS ALSO WORKING ON SELF
DRIVING CARS.
IT WILL BE THE FIRST TO GET A
SELF DRIVING CAR ON THE ROAD IN
PITTSBURGH.
HOW DO YOU SEE THESE COMPANIES
--
ERIC: THE CEO OF ROBER HAS SAID
-- UBER HAS SAID THAT HE SEES
SELF DRIVING CARS IS EXISTENTIAL
TO UBER'S SUCCESS.
SO, THAT IF ANYTHING PUTS THEM
ON A COLLISION COURSE.
I THINK THIS IS SORT OF
INEVITABLE, THAT THERE WOULD BE
A MORE PUBLIC VIEWING OF THE
POTENTIAL AND FUTURE TENSION OF
THE TWO COMPANIES.
EMILY: THERE ARE SOME PARALLELS
HERE TO GOOGLE AND APPLE.
ERIC SCHMIDT WAS ON APPLE'S
BOARD FOR A LONG TIME AND
EVENTUALLY RESIGNED.
COULD WE SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
HAPPENING HERE?
ERIC: IT'S VERY SIMILAR.
THE FUNNY THING WITH ALL THESE
RELATIONSHIPS IS, COMPANIES ARE
SUPER INTERCONNECTED.
UBER IS USING GOOGLE FOR
MAPPING.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, NO MATTER
WHAT, EVEN WHEN THEY ARE
COMPETING THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP.
EMILY: WE ARE GETTING A TWEET IN
HERE OVER AT THE BLOOMBERG
TERMINAL THAT ALPHABETS DAVID
GERMAN HAS LEFT THE UBER BOARD.
THERE WE ARE THEN.
WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF
THIS?
ERIC: IT FIRMS UP WHAT HAS BEEN
BREWING FOR MORE THAN A YEAR
NOW, WHICH IS THAT GOOGLE AND
UBER, THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS
DETERIORATING AND THIS IS SORT
OF A CLEAN WAY TO SAY, OK, NO.
WE SHOULD TAKE HIM OFF OUR
BOARD.
EMILY: A STORY THAT I KNOW WILL
CONTINUE.
DAVID KRANE REMAINS AN OBSERVER
ON THE UBER BOARD.
ERIC NEWCOMER, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
TOMORROW ON BLOOMBERG, DO NOT AS

RESERVE VICE CHAIR, STANLEY
FISCHER.

ANCHOR TOM KEENE ON BLOOMBERG
TELEVISION AND RADIO.
DOCTORS ARE EXAMINING THE EFFECT
OF VIRTUAL REALITY ON OUR MINDS.
HOW THE NEW TECHNOLOGY COULD
HELP WITH PAIN MANAGEMENT, NEXT.
♪
EMILY: FORGET MORPHINE,
HOSPITALS ARE NOW TURNING TO
VIRTUAL REALITY AS AN EFFECTIVE
TREATMENT FOR EVERYTHING FROM
INTENSE PAIN TO ALZHEIMER'S TO
DEPRESSION.
WITH THE PRICE OF HARDWARE
FALLING, VR IS OFTEN AN
AFFORDABLE OPTION.
BLOOMBERGS IN KING TAKES A LOOK
AT THE EFFECTS OF VIRTUAL
REALITY AND HOW IT AN IMPACT IN
MIND.
-- THE MIND.
>> VIRTUAL REALITY IS LIKE A
SPOTLIGHT.
THE EXPERIENCE OF THE MIND SORT
OF BEING IN THIS ENVIRONMENT
WHEN IT IS IMMERSED IN THIS SORT
OF PEACEFUL, POSITIVE
ENVIRONMENT, IT'S ALMOST LIKE
THE REST OF YOUR EXPERIENCES ARE
UNABLE TO BE NOTICED.
IT RECRUITS SO MUCH OF THE BRAIN
TO FOCUS ON THAT SPOTLIGHT THAT
EVERYTHING OUTSIDE OF THAT
ENVIRONMENT FALLS TO THE WAYSIDE
DURING THAT EXPERIENCE OF
VIRTUAL REALITY.
>> CEDARS-SINAI IN L.A. IS ONE
OF A HANDFUL OF'S BILLS
EXPERIMENTING WITH A SURPRISING
NEW TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE
SUFFERING FROM ACUTE PAIN.
>> I WONDER IF WE CAN STOP
ASKING PEOPLE HOW LONG YOU'VE
BEEN HERE AT CEDARS-SINAI.
>> I HAVE BEEN HERE FOR 4 DAYS,
FROM CHRONIC BACK PAIN.
JUST TAKING SOME MEDICATIONS AND
POSSIBLY AN EPIDURAL SOON.
>> I'M IN THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE I
HAVE A TOTAL ARTIFICIAL HEART,
AND LAST WEEK IT HAD A FAILURE.
I'VE BEEN ON THE HEART
MEDICATION FOR PAIN FOR FIVE
YEARS AND I'M REALLY TRYING TO
GET OFF OF IT.
>> I BEEN HAVING PAIN IN MY LEFT
UPPER QUADRANT IN MY RIGHT LOWER
QUADRANT THAT GOES INTO MY BACK.
I CAN'T RELAX.
I'VE HAD EVERY TEST POSSIBLE.
IF THERE WAS A SURGERY, I WOULD
DO IT TODAY.
>> CHRONIC PAIN IS MORE THAN
JUST THE PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE.
IT'S THE BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL
EXPERIENCE.
VIRTUAL REALITY HAS A WAY OF
AFFECTING PEOPLE PHYSICALLY,
EMOTIONALLY, AND TO SOME DEGREE
EVEN SOCIALLY.
>> I DECIDED TO TRY SOMETHING
DIFFERENT, SOMETHING NEW.
>> ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU READY?
>> DO YOU WANT TO GO TO ICELAND?
ARE YOU AFRAID OF HEIGHTS?
>> I'M NOT.
>> PERFECT.
>> VIRTUAL REALITY UNDOUBTEDLY
HAS AN EFFECT IN THE MIND.
IT SORT OF HIJACKS THE BRAIN.
IT CAN BE USED FOR EVIL, BUT IT
CAN ALSO BE USED FOR GOOD.
>> WHAT ARE YOU SEEING?
>> ICE FORMATIONS.
IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU CAN
GRAB ONE.
>> HONESTLY, IN THE 18 YEARS
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING MEDICINE, I
CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING I'VE
DONE THAT'S MORE EFFECTIVE, AND
YOU CAN PHYSICALLY SEE THEIR
BODY LANGUAGE CHANGE.
THEY OFTEN WILL LOOK STRAIGHT
AHEAD LIKE WE ARE LOOKING AT A
STILL IMAGE.
THE MOMENT THEY TURN THEIR HEAD,
THAT IS THE MAGICAL MOMENT.
>> IT LITERALLY IS LIKE TOTAL
PANORAMA.
>> AT THE VERY LEAST, IT DOES NO
HARM AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO
CUT DOWN ON THE NEED FOR DRUGS
LIKE MORPHINE, MAKE PATIENTS
MORE RELAXED, AND EVEN HAVING
THEM WANTING TO GO HOME SOONER.
>> WILL THIS BE SOMETHING YOU
MIGHT REACH TO BEFORE, LET'S
SAY, MORPHINE?
>> IN A MILLION YEARS I NEVER
WOULD'VE THOUGHT THEY WOULD HAVE
BROUGHT IT TO A HOSPITAL TO USE.
>> THIS HELPS ME RELAX.
WHEN THE MUSCLES RELAX, PAIN
GOES AWAY.
>> VR SEEMS TO TAKE PATIENCE OUT
OF THEIR PAIN, AT LEAST FOR A
WHILE.
IT ALSO SEEMS TO TAKE THEM OUT
OF THE CONFINES OF THEIR
HOSPITAL BEDS.
FOR THOSE TRAPPED BY THEIR
CONDITION FROM LONG PERIODS, IT
MAY HELP MITIGATE SOME OF THE
STRESS OF EATING IN HOSPITAL.
>> -- BEING IN HOSPITAL.
>> IT'S LIKE A JAIL CELL,
REALLY.
YOU STILL END UP IN THIS 4X10
ROOM.
>> WE NEED A VIRTUAL-REALITY
PHARMACY, SHELVES OF VR CONTENT
THAT IS EVIDENCE-BASED AND CAN
REACH OFF THE SHELF AND MATCH TO
MY PATIENTS' NEEDS.
THE MORE WE HAVE THAT, THE
BROADER OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE TO
ENGAGE PATIENTS WITH
VIRTUAL-REALITY.
>> THIS IS NOT ABOUT SILICON
VALLEY ENTREPRENEUR IS SOME
GREAT IT'S ABOUT WHEN AND
WHETHER WE SHOULD INTERACT
TECHNOLOGY WITH THE COMPELLING
HUMAN EXPERIENCE OF BEING A
PATIENT.
IT'S NOT A COMPUTING SCIENCE, IS
NOT AN ENGINEERING SCIENCE.

ANNOUNCER: FROM OUR STUDIOS IN
NEW YORK CITY, THIS IS "CHARLIE
ROSE." 
CHARLIE: KENNETH BRENNA IS HERE.
HE IS STARRING AT THE ARMORY
HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.
THE COMPANY FROM MANCHESTER,
ENGLAND HAS RECEIVED
EXTRAORDINARY REVIEWS.
HE REVOKED -- EVOKED MEMORIES OF
OLIVIER.
HERE IS A LOOK AT THE TRAILER.
>> WHAT, TELL ME YOU WANT SPEAK
TRUE? 
>> YOU LOOK LIKE A FLOWER.
>> IS THIS A DAGGER WHICH I SEE
BEFORE ME? 
>> THE DOOR, UNCERTAINTY DO NOT
CHARGE.
>> IT WILL BE THE DAGGER.
>> ORDER KING ALL.
>> ORDERS FROM THE PROVINCE.
CHARLIE: I AM PLEASED TO HAVE
SIR KENNETH BRENNAGH BACK HERE
THIS TABLE.
HAVE YOU BEEN WAITING TO DO
THIS? 
KENNETH: I HAVE BEEN CIRCLING
IT.
IT IS THE COPY I FIRST CAME
ACROSS ON OUR KITCHEN TABLE AND
I WAS ABOUT 10 OR 11 YEARS OLD,
MY BROTHER WAS FIVE YEARS OLDER
THAN ME, AND HE WAS DOING IT AT
SCHOOL.
I SAW THE THREE WYRD SISTERS ON
THE COVER.
THIS IS THE SAME COPY I HAVE
WITH ME EVERY NIGHT, ON MY
DRESSING ROOM TABLE.
40 YEARS OF THIS.
CHARLIE: IS IT UNIQUE TO DO IT
AT THIS TIME IN YOUR LIFE? 
KENNETH: I THINK I HAD A GREAT
OLD ACTING SCHOOL MENTOR WHO
USED TO RUN THE ACADEMY OF
DRAMATIC ART.
HE SAID YOU HAVE GOT TO WAIT
UNTIL YOU ARE THE RIGHT AGE,
WHATEVER THAT IS.
HE SAID YOU MIGHT 30'S AND 40'S,
YOU ARE TOO YOUNG.
I DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT.
I REVERED HIM.
SOMEHOW IT CAME TOGETHER THROUGH
VIRTUE, THROUGH MEETING ROB
ASHFIELD, MY BRILLIANT
CODIRECTOR AND FINDING THE RIGHT
ELEMENTS, THE ACTRESS TO BE
LEADING MACBETH.
THE ELEMENTS STARTED TO PULL
TOGETHER.
CHARLIE: YOU HAD A 10 YEAR
ABSENCE FROM SHAKESPEARE.
KENNETH: I HAD, AND LIKE MANY
THINGS IN MY CAREER, OTHERS MAY
LOOK AT IT DIFFERENTLY.
THESE ACCIDENTS HAPPEN.
MY WIFE TALKS ABOUT IT.
SHE SAYS PEOPLE SAY TO ME, DOES
HE READ SHAKESPEARE BY THE
BEDSIDE? 
I SAID, WHAT DO YOU TELL THEM? 
SHE SAID, YES, YOU DO, BECAUSE
YOU ALWAYS ARE.
SO I TOOK 10 YEARS AWAY FROM
DOING IT, BUT QUITE A LOT OF
TIME JUST READING OR BEING
EXPOSED.
IT IS ALWAYS IN MY LIFE.
CHARLIE: WHAT IS THIS DIFFERENT?
KENNETH: I SUPPOSE EVERY TIME A
GROUP OF PARTICULAR PEOPLE DO IT
, THERE IS A CERTAIN ELEMENTAL
PART OF THE PEACE, SO MAYBE THE
FIRST THING WE DO IS TO TAKE A
SPEECH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
PLAY, SPOKEN BY A CHARACTER
CALLED THE BLOODY SERGEANT,
WHICH IS THE DESCRIPTION OF A
BATTLE IN WHICH MACBETH IS
EXTREMELY BRAVE AND HEROIC,
FEARLESS IN FACT.
INTERESTING FOR A CHARACTER WHO
WILL BECOME FEARFUL FOR THE REST
OF THE PLAY.
WE DARED TAKE THAT AWAY AND PUT
WHAT HE DESCRIBES ON STAGE.
AND WE WANTED TO DO THAT FOR A
COUPLE OF REASONS.
FIRST HE SAID, WHEN YOU MEET
MACBETH, YOU KNOW A LITTLE OF
WHAT THEY REALLY MEAN OF THIS
YEAR LISTEN, SAVAGERY.
A MAN WHO YOU IMAGINE IN FIRST
PLACE SHOULD NOT HAVE THE
PROBLEMS THAT HE TURNS OUT TO
HAVE LATER ON WHEN FOCUSED WITH
ANOTHER MURDER.
IN BATTLE, HE SEEMS FEARLESS.
WHAT WE WANTED TO CHIEFLY DO WAS
INTRODUCED TO THE AUDIENCE A
THEATRICAL ENERGY WHICH WAS
HECTIC AND HURTLING, WHERE THEY
CAN LITERALLY BE A PART OF THE
HECTIC NATURE BETWEEN THE
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THESE TWO
FUNDAMENTALLY, AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE PLAY, GOOD PEOPLE WHO
MAKE BAD DECISIONS BECAUSE THE
PLAY, CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PLOT
DOES NOT GIVE YOU TIME TO THINK.
CHARLIE: THE NEW YORK TIMES
LOVED THE PLAY.
THEY CAPTURED THAT VERY THING,
HURTLING.
FROM THE BEGINNING, YOU HAVE
THAT KIND OF ENERGY.
KENNETH: THEY WERE ALSO
INTERESTED IN WHAT GOES IN THE
CARDINAL SIN POWER, AND WHY AND
HOW THESE TWO PEOPLE COULD DO
THIS EXTRAORDINARY THING.
ONE THINKS ABOUT IN PLAYS, IT IS
EASY TO THINK ABOUT IT IN
MELODRAMATIC TERMS, BUT THIS MAN
KILLED A FRIEND OF HIS, WHO IS
KING, WHATEVER, AND HE DOESN'T
VERY SWIFTLY AND WITHOUT OTHERS
BEING CONSCIOUS.
SO OTHERS DISMISS IT AS IT IS
ABSURD, IT HAPPENS TOO QUICKLY.
OUR PRODUCTION WAS TRYING TO SAY
PERHAPS THESE THINGS ONLY HAPPEN
QUICKLY WITHOUT THOUGHT.
CHARLIE: AND ABOUT HIS WIFE? 
KENNETH: SHE, I CAN'T DESCRIBE
HER AS NOT WITHOUT AMBITION BUT
A SICKNESS, TOO FULL OF THE MILK
OF HUMAN KINDNESS.
THERE ARE REMARKS OF HER BEING
ESSENTIALLY GOOD-NATURED, BUT
ONCE HE HAS HAD THIS AMAZING
SUCCESS, REVIEWS ARE BRILLIANT
AS IT WERE THAT DUNCAN SAYS
FANTASTIC, I AM GOING TO GIVE
YOU, I AM PLANTING YOU, YOU WILL
HAVE ALL SORTS OF REWARDS.
CHARLIE: A NEW NAME.
KENNETH: A NEW NAME EVEN, BUT I
AM GIVING MY JOB TO HIM, INSTEAD
OF MY SON.
AND IMMEDIATELY MAC BETH,
CERTAINLY WITH THE WITCHES IN
HIS PRONOUNCEMENT, A FEW SHORT
MOMENTS AGO, SAY, WHY SHOULD HE
BE IN THE WAY? 
I WILL HAVE TO TAKE THIS STEP
THAT LAYS IN MY WAY, WHICH I
MUST FALL DOWN OR ELSE OR LEAP.
OR LEAP, OR LEAP MEANS MURDER IN
THIS CONTEXT.
IT IS BASICALLY A WONDERFUL PLAY
FOR PUTTING PEOPLE IN THIS
UNUSUAL, EXTREME POSITION.
CHARLIE: THE WITCHES ARE GREAT.
YOU SEE THE OPENING WITH THIS
DON'T HAND KIND OF THING.
-- YOU SEE THE OPENING WITH THIS
STONEHENGE KIND OF THING.
KENNETH: IN THE LIVES OF THE
GOOD AND THE GREAT, THE POWER OF
SUGGESTION.
SOME WOULD SAY IT IS A SILLY
PLAY BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT A MAN
WHO BELIEVES HIS RISK UP.
THERE -- HIS HOROSCOPE.
CHARLIE: WOMEN OF POWER BELIEVE
IN MYTH AS WELL.
KENNETH: AND ALSO, A PLACE IN
HISTORY AND THIS IDEA OF WHAT
THE LEGACY IS.
MACBETH AND LADY MACBETH APPEAR
TO NOT HAVE CHILDREN, SO
IMMORTALITY IS NOT GUARANTEED BY
FAMILY.
SO NOW IMMORTALITY CAN PERHAPS
BE SEIZED BY HAVING A NAME IN
THE HISTORY BOOKS.
CHARLIE: THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THE TWO, IS SHE MORE MET
AMBITIOUS THAN HE IS? 
KENNETH: I THINK SHE IS EQUALLY
AMBITIOUS.
ONE OF THE THINGS WE TRIED TO
BRING IN WITH THIS SAVAGERY, SHE
SAYS GOODBYE AND HE GOES OFF TO
BATTLE, THE IDEA OF WHETHER HE
COMES HOME OR NOT IS REALLY VERY
HEAVILY QUESTIONED.
WHEN THEY DO COME BACK, WE DO
PRESENT, WE WANTED TO PRESENT
THIS FUNCTIONING RELATIONSHIP.
THEY SCARE THE PANTS OFF OF EACH
OTHER.
VERY PASSIONATE.
CHARLIE: THE PASSION COMES OUT.
KENNETH: IAN MCKELLEN WOULD
ARGUE THERE ARE NO SUCCESSFUL
MARRIAGES IN SHAKESPEARE EXCEPT
TO THE MCBETHS, WHICH THEY BOTH
DIE AND THEY BOTH KILL A KING
ALONG THE WAY.
I FIRST THOUGHT THE CONVERSATION
THAT WAS ESSENTIAL TO THE SHOW,
TO THE PERFORMANCE IS THAT HE
ADORES HER.
SHE IS A NATURAL COMPANION FOR
HIM, AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW,
THE BREAKUP -- 
CHARLIE: IS SHE STRONGER OR
WEAKER? 
KENNETH: I CAN'T -- THEY BOTH AT
DIFFERENT TIMES INVOKE THE DARK
WORLD.
SHE IS THE FIRST ONE TO SAY
RIGHT, I AM INVITING EVIL INTO
THE ROOM.
WE ARE IN A WORLD WHERE WE
BELIEVE IN IT.
YOU AUDIENCE HAVE JUST ENOUGH
BECAUSE THEY WERE HANGING AROUND
THE STONES AND THEY WERE SCARY,
INVITING THEM IN.
SHE HAS TO DO IT IN THE FIRST
TIME IN AN FIRST TIME OUT.
HE, THE BALANCE OF PULITZER --
OF POWER SWITCHES.
AND THEN WITH THIS MAIL-FEMALE
POINT OF VIEW, HE SAYS LET'S NOT
DO IT TONIGHT, SHE SAYS YOU HAVE
GOT TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY.
THEN HE BECOMES PRESIDENT AND
SAYS LEAVE EVERYTHING ALONE, BUT
HE WILL SWEAR OFF -- 
CHARLIE: AND THE PROPHECY FROM
THE WITCHES.
WHAT THEY SAID, THEREFORE HE
WENT OFF KILLING ANYBODY.
KENNETH: HE SPENDS ELITE TRYING
TO SWEAR THE CIRCLE.
-- ESSENTIALLY TRYING TO SWEAR
THE CIRCLE.
INSTEAD OF BEING THE FATHER OF
KINGS, HE TRIES TO BUILD BOTH
HIM AND HIS SON.
HIS DETERMINATION TO LEAVE NO
STONE UNTURNED MEANS HE WON'T
EVER SLEEP AGAIN.
AND THERE IS NO SATISFACTION.
AND THE FIRST MOMENT WE SEE HIM
ASKING, HE IS WITH HER, AND THEY
CELEBRATE.
THE PRODUCTION HOUSE WALKS ON AT
THE CORONATION.
HE SAYS, TO BE THUS IS NOTHING.
TO BE SAFELY THUS.
I AM HERE, I GOT A CROWN, AND IS
NOTHING.
CHARLIE: SAFELY.
KENNETH: TO BE SAFELY, AND THEN
HE SPLURGES IN PARANOIA.
CHARLIE: YOU THOUGHT ABOUT DOING
IT IN THE 20TH -- WAY IN THE
FUTURE, A VERY FUTURISTIC KIND.
WHAT DREW YOU AWAY FROM THAT TO
WHERE YOU ARE? 
KENNETH: THIS DIFFICULT THING OF
WHEN YOU COME UP WITH A SORT OF,
WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A SORT OF
CONCEPT FOR THE WORLD OF THE
PLAY, AND ALL OF THESE PLAYS ARE
VERY ELASTIC SO THEY CAN ADAPT.
SHAKESPEARE CAN SURVIVE ANYTHING
WE STRUCK HIM UP WITH.
BUT MANY TIMES, THE IDEA HAS TO
DO WITH PRODUCTIVE QUALITY.
YOU MIGHT GET, YOU SET THE
MERCHANT OF VENICE IN THE NEW
YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, AND YOU GET
A RESONANCE WITH THE WORLD OF
MONEY, BUT IS ALSO ABOUT LOVE,
WHETHER THE GIRL IS GOING TO
CHOOSE THE BOY OR WHATEVER IT
MIGHT BE.
SO THE FUTURISTIC MCBETH FELT AS
THOUGH IT POTENTIALLY DENIED THE
SAVAGERY AND PRIMITIVE NATURE OF
SOME OF THESE.
AND MALCOLM LATER ON SAYS WE
WILL MAKE THOSE WHO HELPED ME
HERE EARLS, THE FIRST THAT
SCOTLAND EVER HAS.
YOU SENSE THE JOURNEY FROM
PRIMITIVE TO MORE SENSIBLE WHERE
PEOPLE IN POWER WILL GIVE YOU AN
HONOR.
CHARLIE: IT IS FASCINATING ABOUT
SHAKESPEARE.
FIRST OF ALL, I THINK I READ
THAT JAMES V, WHO BECAME JAMES I
OF ENGLAND, WOULD COME TO
SHAKESPEARE PLAYS.
KENNETH: HE WAS OBSESSED WITH
THE SUBJECT.
CHARLIE: THE STORY OF MACBETH,
THEY THINK HE GOT FROM THE
CHRONICLES? 
KENNETH: YES, SURE.
SHAKESPEARE WAS FANTASTICALLY
COMPREHENSIVE IN WHERE HE WENT
FOR ALL OF HIS STORIES.
AND ALSO, HE KNEW HOW TO BORROW,
AND HE KNEW HOW TO BE INSPIRED.
WE DID RECENTLY, ALEX AND I, THE
RADIANT.
A FAMOUS SPEECH ABOUT THE PART
SHE SAT ON LIKE A BURNISHED
THRONE.
CHARLIE: THERE IS A COMPARISON
BETWEEN THE TWO.
KENNETH: THE ESSENTIAL FOCUS ON
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TO COME
LOCATED PEOPLE, A POWERFUL MAN
WITH A BRILLIANT WOMAN, AND THEY
HAVE A BALANCING IMPACT.
BUT THE BARD SPEECH IN THOMAS
NORTH'S LIVES OF THE ANCIENT
ROMANS, ETC., SHAKESPEARE
COULTERS FAIRLY COME
INTENSIVELY.
HE SCATTERED HIS GATHERINGS, BUT
-- 
CHARLIE: EVERY WRITER STEALS A
GREAT DEAL.
KENNETH: YEAH, YEAH.
CHARLIE: THE RESULTS OF THIS IN
TERMS OF, WHEN YOU, THERE ARE
THESE SOLILOQUIES YOU HAVE WITH
LINES, TOMORROW AND TOMORROW AND
TOMORROW, DID YOU APPROACH THOSE
DIFFERENTLY? 
THAT YOU WANTED TO, IN YOUR OWN
RENDITION NOT TO BE DIFFERENT
FROM ANYONE ELSE WHO HAD BEEN
MACBETH, BUT SOME SENSE OF HOW
YOU WANTED TO TAKE THESE
DIFFERENT MOMENTS? 
AND DELIVER THEM? 
KENNETH: IT IS A QUESTION, FOR
INSTANCE WITH TOMORROW AND
TOMORROW AND TOMORROW, IT GREW
ORGANICALLY OUT OF THIS IDEA
THAT ASIDE FROM THE SORT OF FAST
AND EXISTENTIAL HOWL AS YOU MAY
EXPECT IT TO BE, IT IS ALSO --
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SPEECH
-- A SPEECH OF MOURNING FOR HIS
WIFE.
IN OUR PRODUCTION, THAT IS SO
UNDERLINED THE PASSION BETWEEN
THEM, THE DYNAMIC BETWEEN
PAINFUL, PERSONAL LOSS OF A
WOMAN THAT HE ADORED THROUGH HIS
OWN STRUTTING AND FRETTING AND
IDIOCY, IF YOU LIKE, INFORMS THE
WAY THAT CAME OUT.
IT BECAME VERY PERSONAL.
WE WANTED TO TAKE AWAY -- WHAT I
HAVE SEEN SOMETIMES IN VERSIONS
OF THE PLAY WHICH IS PERFECTLY
FINE BUT NOT TO MY TASTE, THAT
IT BE TO DRY, TOO INTELLECTUALLY
EXTREME.
CHARLIE: YOU DID NOT WANT THAT.
KENNETH: I DID NOT WANT IT TO BE
DRY.
VISCERAL, PASSIONATE, AS MUCH
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE
PLAY AS THERE IS LESS OPTICAL
INTELLIGENCE.
IT CAN GET VERY DRY BECAUSE THE
POETRY IS OUT DENSE, SO
BRILLIANT, SO COMPLEX.
THE DOUBLE UP WITH SHAKESPEARE
IS THAT IF YOU CONNECT ALL OF
THAT BRILLIANCE, ALL OF THAT
INTELLECTUAL FIREPOWER AT THIS
INCREDIBLE LEVEL WITH THIS SENSE
THAT YOU ARE WATCHING REAL LIVE
HUMAN BEINGS, AND THERE BEFORE
THE GRADE -- THE GRACE OF GOD GO
ALL OF US.
CHARLIE: DEALING WITH LIFE AND
DEATH AND HORROR.
KENNETH: YEAH, SURE.
CHARLIE: OR RAGE AND GUILT.
KENNETH: PEOPLE, MY GOODNESS ME,
YOU CAN FEEL THE ATMOSPHERE IN
THE AUDIENCE.
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THE
BEGINNING OF THE PLAY AND
PERHAPS WITH THE AUDIENCE,
BACKING AWAY FROM THIS WITH
THEIR FINGERS THROBBING, THEY
HAVE DONE IT.
KING DUNCAN, I KILLED ONE OF OUR
FRIENDS.
NOW WHAT DO WE DO THEY BECOME
LIKE CHILDREN ALMOST.
IN THAT MOMENT PEOPLE MAY NOT
KILL A KING, BUT THEY ARE GOING
TO DO THINGS FOR WHICH THEY CAN
NEVER RECOVER.
IN ONE NANOSECOND, LIFE WILL
NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN.
YOU FEEL ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE GO,
OH MY GOD.
THAT COULD BE ME.
CHARLIE: EITHER THE CHOICE YOU
MADE OR THINGS THRUST UPON YOU.
KENNETH: IT IS TERRIBLY MOVING.
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE BEEN
THRILLED WITH IS PEOPLE FIND
THIS MOVING.
WHY SHOULD YOU FEEL MOVED OR
EVEN SOME PATHETIC TO CHARACTERS
WHO PERFORM SUCH HEINOUS ACTS,
BUT SOMEHOW SHAKESPEARE'S
MASTERY -- 
CHARLIE: GENIUS.
KENNETH: BY THE END WHEN HE
LOSES HER AND CONVEY EITHER IN
LADY MACBETH SORT OF SCENT INTO
WHAT MAY APPEAR TO BE MADNESS,
OR WHAT YOU ALREADY SENSE WITH
MAC BETH AT THE END, SORT OF A
GRAND THING TO SAY, BUT THE
BLEAKNESS IN HIS SOUL IS SO
PROFOUND, IT IS CHILLING.
THE GLIMPSE OF A KIND OF DARK
ETERNITY THAT HE SHOWS US IS SO
TERRIFYING THAT YOU CAN'T HELP
BUT BE MOVED BECAUSE THE PRICE
HE HAS PAID FOR THIS MOMENT OF
RECKLESS AMBITION IS SO DEEP AND
PROFOUND AS TO SHAKE ONE TO THE
VERY CORE ON HIS BEHALF.
CHARLIE: AND LEAD TO HIS DEATH.
KENNETH: YEAH.
ISN'T IT STRANGE? 
IN THE END HE IS -- HE IS
FEARLESS AND BATTLE IN THE
BEGINNING.
THROUGH THE POWER OF SUGGESTION,
HE IS FEARFUL AND GUILT LADEN,
DREAM AND -- WHAT THE
SHAKESPEARE SEEM TO ADMIRE IN
HIS SOLDIER POETS, BOTH FELLOW,
MACBETH? 
IT IS BLOOD AND GUTS.
HE IS RIGHT THERE IN THE END.
I AM GOING TO KISS THE GROUND
BEFORE MALCOLM'S FEET.
HE HAS THE FOREST MOVED IT, YOU
WEREN'T BORN OF WOMAN AND A BEAR
AGAINST ME.
YOU KNOW WHAT? 
COME AND GET IT.
I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT.
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT? 
SHOW ME SOMETHING.
HE JUST HANGS IN THERE.
SOMEHOW THERE IS A PROFOUND
RESPECT FOR THIS MAN.
I NEVER RAN AWAY.
AND HE TALKS TO HER, AND
COMPLIMENT THEM BOTH, TWO WORDS,
TWO TIMES USES THE WORD
DAUNTLESS.
AND SHAKESPEARE ADMIRES, AND I
DO, PEOPLE WHO TAKE WHATEVER
LIFE THROWS AT THEM, ONE FOOT IN
FRONT OF THE OTHER.
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO? 
SHAKESPEARE OFTEN SAYS THAT.
YOU WANT TO FEEL GRANDER, BUT
SOMETIMES THAT IS ALL YOU HAVE
TO DO IS SHOW UP.
CHARLIE: IN YOUR OWN PANTHEON,
IS THERE 1, 2, 3 AMONG
SHAKESPEARE'S WORKS? 
KENNETH: GOSH, WHAT A QUESTION.
YOUR LIFE CHANGES, YOU HAVE OR
EXPERIENCE, YOU REACTED
DIFFERENTLY TO THESE THINGS.
YOU HAVE HAD MILLIE BRILLIANT
CAP -- MANY BRILLIANT
CONVERSATIONS WITH HAROLD BLOOM.
AND THE POLISH SCHOLAR, FAMOUS
FROM THE 1960'S, WE CALLED HIM
OUR CONTEMPORARY.
AND HAMLET SUMS UP THE PROCESS
OF LIVING, THAT APPLIES ACROSS
MANY OF THESE PLAYS.
RIGHT NOW ONE'S SOUL IS SHAKEN
WITH WHAT MACBETH DOES TO THE
AUDIENCE.
WE ARE THERE.
WE ARE THE LUCKY VESSELS OR
WHICH THIS RING PASSES CURRENTLY
IN THIS -- THIS THING PASSES
CURRENTLY IN THIS SHOW.
CHARLIE: FIVE MINUTES BEFORE YOU
GO ON, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO YOURSELF?
KENNETH: I AM MEDITATING.
CHARLIE: CLEARING YOUR MIND.
KENNETH: MY FAVORITE QUOTE FROM
SHAKESPEARE, FROM HAMLET IS "THE
READINESS IS ALL." 
THAT IS ALL I DO.
PEOPLE SAY YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL
TIME IN NEW YORK? 
OH, YES, BUT PARTLY BECAUSE I AM
AT THE THEATER MANY HOURS BEFORE
ANY SANE HUMAN BEING WOULD BE.
I READ THE LINES EVERY DAY, DO
THE WHOLE PLAY IN VARYING WAYS,
TRICK YOURSELF TO KEEP IT FRESH.
FIVE MINUTES BEFORE YOU GO ON,
MEDITATE.
AND THE OTHER THING, I SWEAR TO
GOD I THINK THIS IS JUST THE
MOST FANTASTIC THING THAT WE
HAVE TO DO.
IT IS REALLY TINGLING, NOT AN
EASY THING TO DO GIVEN ONE IS
AWARE OF THE SORT OF EFFORT IN
TERMS OF WHAT WE DO, BUT IT IS
ABSOLUTELY GLORIOUS, GLORIOUS
THING TO DO.
I SOMETIMES FEEL -- I'M A BIG
FAN OF SPORTS GENERALLY.
IT FEELS LIKE YOU ARE IN THE
TUNNEL WAITING TO COME OUT
BEFORE HUGE GAME.
IT IS LIKE TOURNAMENT TENNIS OR
SOMETHING.
SOME OF IT IS UP HERE, SOME OF
IT IS IN THE BODY.
IN OUR CASE WE START WITH A FIVE
MINUTE BATTLE.
THEN YOU ARE -- OH IT REVS YOU
UP.
WE FIGHT EVERY DAY.
IT IS RAINING, WE ARE IN THE
DARK AND 25 ENORMOUS FELLOWS
COME OUT WITH COLD STEEL.
CHARLIE: YOU HAVE GOT TO BE
ATHLETIC, TOO.
.
KENNETH: IT IS MORE ABOUT THE
DISCIPLINE REQUIRED ON THIS
PARTICULAR JOB THAN EVER BEFORE.
CHARLIE: GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE.
KENNETH: THANKS VERY MUCH.
CHARLIE: BACK IN A MOMENT.
♪
♪
CHARLIE: MARK ROLLINS IS HERE.
HE WON A TONY AWARD FOR HIS
PERFORMANCE IN BOEING, BOEING.
HE IS BACK ON BROADWAY PLAYING
THE LEAD IN TO SHAKESPEARE PLAYS
IN REPERTORY.
HE IS KING RICHARD IN RICHARD
III AND ANOTHER IN 12TH NIGHT.
HE SERVED AS ASSISTANT DIRECTOR.
CHARLESWOOD OF THE NEW YORK
TIMES HAS WRITTEN HIS PRESENCE
ON BROADWAY THIS SEASON HAS
PROVIDED A MINIATURE ACTING
CLASS IN SHAKESPEAREAN ACTING.
I AM PLEASED TO HAVE MARK
ROLLINS AT THE TABLE.
WHAT A NIGHT.
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? 
THESE TWO PLAYS COMING HERE FOR
YOU TO SHOW YOUR STUFF? 
MARK: HAS TAKEN QUITE A FEW
YEARS.
IN PARTICULAR, THE ARTIST,
DIRECTOR AND CLOTHING AND SET
DESIGNER AND THE MUSICAL
DIRECTOR, AND THE KIND OF CORE
PLAYERS ARE PEOPLE THAT WORKED
WITH ME A LOT WHEN I WAS
ARTISTIC DIRECTOR AT THE GLOBE.
WHEN MY TIME FINISHED, MY 10
YEARS FINISHED, I IMMEDIATELY
STARTED TO WANT TO PRESERVE OR
CARRY ON THE ESSENTIAL CORE WORK
OF WHAT WE DID, WHICH WAS A VERY
CAREFUL, AND I HOPE RIGOROUS,
ATTEMPT TO EXPLORE WHAT I CALL
ORIGINAL PLAYING PRACTICES.
HOPEFULLY KNOWN FROM
SHAKESPEARE'S DAY.
SO IT TOOK A LONG TIME.
WE HAD TO FIGURE OUT A WAY OF
MOUNTING TO PRODUCTIONS THAT
WOULD BE POPULAR ENOUGH TO RAISE
ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE A WHOLE NEW
WARDROBE OF CLOTHES AS THE
ELIZABETHANS SPEND THEIR MONEY
OF WHAT THEY WERE ON THEIR
BACKS.
CHARLIE: WHAT WAS THE TERM YOU
USE IN TERMS OF ORIGINAL
PRODUCTION? 
MARK: ORIGINAL PLAYING
PRACTICES.
THAT INSPIRED WHAT I WANT TO
MAKE IN AMERICAN -- THE AMERICA
THAT FOUNDED THE GLOBE.
NOT ONLY INTELLECTUAL INQUIRY
INTO HOW THE PLATE MIGHT HAVE
ORIGINATED, WHAT CONDITIONS
SHAKES YOUR IMAGINED WHEN HE
WROTE THESE -- SHAKESPEARE
IMAGINED WHEN HE WROTE THESE
INCREDIBLE PLACE BUT YOU COULD
EXPLORE WITH LIVE AUDIENCES AND
LIVE PLAYS.
SO HE SPENT THE LAST 25 YEARS
BUILDING THE GLOBE THEATER AND
DIED IN 1993, AND I BECAME
ARTISTIC DIRECTOR IN 1995.
HIS THINKING ABOUT THE GLOBE WAS
REALLY THE INSPIRATION FOR ME,
WHICH WAS HE DEMANDED THREE
THINGS.
I'M A VERY THOROUGH RESEARCH --
THREE THINGS, VERY, VERY
THOROUGH RESEARCH, MATERIALS,
THE FIRST FACT BUILDING SINCE
THE GREAT FIRE.
A THOUSAND OAK TREES WENT INTO
IT, LINE CLOTH, ALL KINDS OF OLD
BUILDING TECHNIQUES AND ORIGINAL
CRAFT SHOULD BE USED AS WELL.
CHARLIE: SO THE PREMISE IS IT
WOULD BE MORE INSIDE OF
SHAKESPEARE'S HEAD IF WE DID
THAT? 
KENNETH: WE CONFIRMED -- 
MARK: WE CONFIRMED WE WOULD
LEARN MORE ABOUT THE REASON HE
WROTE THE PLACE AND THE REASON
HE WROTE THEM.
-- THE PLAYS AND THE REASON HE
WROTE THEM.
THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES, HOW
FAST IT TAKES, HOW FAST DID THEY
PLAY, WERE THE PLACE CUT TWO
HOURS, DID THEY PLAY VERY
RAPIDLY? 
WAS IT TWO HOURS JUST TO DO WITH
AMPHITHEATERS, VERSUS PLAYING
INSIDE? 
FOR AN ACTOR, THE SPACE IS
REMARKABLE.
IT IS DAYLIGHT.
THE ONLY PLAYED IN THE
AFTERNOON.
THERE ARE TWO WHOPPING GREAT
PILLARS, SO THERE IS NOWHERE YOU
CAN STAND WHERE SOME PEOPLE IN
THE AUDIENCE WON'T SEE YOU, BUT
EVERYONE CAN HEAR YOU LIKE A
BELL.
TO THE FACT THAT AT THAT TIME A
COMMENTATOR LIKE MYSELF, IF THEY
WENT TO THE GLOBE AND SAY, I
WANT TO HEAR JULIUS USER, THEY
NEVER SAID, I WENT TO SEE A
PLAYER AT THE GLOBE, THEY WENT
TO HEAR IT.
IT IMMEDIATELY DEMANDED IN MY
TIME AT LEAST, A LOT MORE RIGOR
ON ELOQUENCE.
CHARLIE: BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT
THESE TWO PLAYS, 10 YEARS AS
ARTISTIC DIRECTOR AT THE GLOBE
THEATER.
IF YOU WERE ASKED TO GIVE A LAST
LECTURE ABOUT SHAKESPEARE, WHAT
WOULD YOU WANT US TO KNOW? 
MARK: WHAT COMES TO THE TOP OF
MY HEAD MAY NOT BE THE DEEPEST
ANSWER, BUT YOU JUST CAN'T, YOU
WILL NEVER GET TO THE BOTTOM OF
HIS SENSE OF HUMOR AND SENSE OF
WIT AND HUMOR.
IT IS WELL-KNOWN THAT ONE OF THE
GREAT THINGS HE IS REALLY GOOD
AT DOING IS MARRYING OPPOSITES,
JUXTAPOSING, OPPOSING SOUNDS,
HOT EYES, COLD FIRE.
ROMEO SAYS AT ONE POINT. ALSO
JUXTAPOSING TRAGEDY AND COMEDY.
AND HIS DEEP SENSE OF HUMOR EVEN
THE MOST TRAGIC MOMENTS -- EVEN
IN THE MOST TRAGIC MOMENTS STILL
STAGGERS ME.
I DON'T GENERALLY FIND IT
MYSELF.
I FIND IN PERFORMANCE WITH AN
AUDIENCE THERE IS SOMETHING
ABOUT -- 
CHARLIE: THE AUDIENCE TELLS YOU
WHAT IS YOURS.
MARK: IT IS A COLLECTIVE THING
THAT HAPPENS WHEN A BUNCH OF
PEOPLE FOCUS ON ONE THING.
MAYBE RELIGIONS KNOW THIS AND
HAVE KNOWN IT FOREVER, BUT IT
HAPPENS IN THEATERS AS WELL.
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE FOCUSING ON
ONE TOPIC OR ONE-STORY, AND THE
CASE OF SHAKESPEARE, AND THEY
ARE ALL IN THE SAME ROOM, IT
FEELS LIKE EACH INDIVIDUAL IS
CAPABLE OF SOMETHING MORE WHEN
WE ARE TOGETHER FOCUSED ON
SOMETHING, AS IF THE INTERNET IS
A MANIFESTATION OF SOMETHING
THAT EXISTS NATURALLY IN HUMAN
CONSCIOUSNESS.
THAT THERE IS A COLLECTIVE
CONSCIOUSNESS IN THE ROOM.
CHARLIE: THE BRAIN, THE
COALESCING OF ONE THING IS MUCH
LARGER THAN THE SUM OF THE
INDIVIDUAL PARTS.
KENNETH: SO THE -- 
MARK: THE WHICH BECAME THE
GLOBE, WHICH IS MORE RECTANGULAR
OR SQUARE SHAPED, AND THE GLOBE
IS CIRCULAR.
THAT COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF
PLAYING THERE FOR 10 YEARS
REALLY AWAKENED THIS TO ME, MORE
THE SENSE OF HUMOR OF THE
AUTHOR.
IT IS THE THING I WOULD SAY THAT
I WOULD, I WOULD HOPE WOULD TAKE
A LONG TIME BEFORE THE UNIVERSE
DESTROYS THAT.
CHARLIE: YOUR INTEREST IN
SHAKESPEARE GOES WAY BACK, TO
HIGH SCHOOL? 
MARK: IT DOES.
I SKIPPED THE REST OF THE PARTY
AND JUST PLAYED HAMILTON WHEN I
WAS 16.
CHARLIE: YOU HAVE SINCE PLAYED
HAMILTON -- HAMLET, ROMEO,
MACBETH.
MARK: I HAVE BEEN 52 PRODUCTIONS
OF PLAYS BY SHAKESPEARE OR HIS
CONTEMPORARIES, MIDDLETON,
PEOPLE WHO AT THE TIME -- 
CHARLIE: IS IT ANY BETTER
TRAINING FOR AN ACTOR? 
MARK: I HOPE SO.
THERE ARE MUCH BETTER ACTORS
THAN ME.
CHARLIE: NO, NO, TO GET INTO
SHAKESPEARE AND SHAKESPEAREAN
CALENDARS.
IS THAT THE BEST POSSIBLE
TRAINING FOR AN ACTOR? 
MARK: NO, I WOULD NOT SAY THAT.
I AM NOT SOMEONE WHO'S ONLY
OPINION IS SHAKESPEARE SHOULD BE
MEANT FOR EVERYONE OR LOVED BY
EVERYONE.
CHARLIE: OR SOMEHOW BECAUSE OF
THE RANGE, IT GIVES YOU AN
OPPORTUNITY TO DIG DEEP IN
UNDERSTANDING HUMAN NATURE,
THEREFORE UNDERSTANDING ACTING
OR LARGER ABILITY TO INHABIT
DIFFERENT CHARACTERS? 
MARK: IT DEPENDS HOW YOU
APPROACH IT.
YOU AND I COULD GET A SET OF
PAINTS WHERE WE DO NOT
NECESSARILY COME UP WITH THE
SAME THING.
CHARLIE: IT DOES NOT COME FROM
THE PAINTING, IT COMES FROM THE
HEAD.
MARK: IT COMES FROM YOUR LIFE
AND THE WAY IN WHICH YOU DEAL
WITH SHAKESPEAREAN MATERIAL.
I DON'T KNOW THAT ROBERT ORDERED
TRACY OR CLIFF -- BRANDO
ACTUALLY GIVES THE BEST SHAKES.
PERFORMANCES FOR MY TASTE I HAVE
EVER HEARD LIKE MARK ANTHONY.
ALSO YOU GET THE TESTING
PERFORMANCE FROM GILDER, VERY
FAST.
INCREDIBLY FAST.
CHARLIE: WHY IS BRANDO AS MARC
ANTHONY A GOOD? 
MARK: BECAUSE HE IS SO PRESENCE.
THOSE WORDS HAD NEVER BEEN SAID
BEFORE, AND HE ABSOLUTELY NEEDS
TO CONVINCE THE FRIEND, THE
ROMANS, THE COUNTRYMEN -- 
CHARLIE: THAT HAS BEEN SAID AT
THIS TABLE BEFORE.
CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT THESE WORDS
HAVE NEVER BEEN SAID BEFORE, AND
I AM JUST THE ONE.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.
IT IS GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE.
♪
CHARLIE: STEPHEN FRY IS HERE, HE
IS A WRITER, DOCUMENTARY MAKER
AND LYRICAL ACTIVIST.
HE HAS INTERVIEWED STEVE JOBS,
BEEN TO PRESENT AND HE THOUGHT
HE WOULD DEVOTE HIS LIFE TO
STUDYING SHAKESPEARE.
HE'S MAKING HIS BROADWAY DEBUT
PLAYING MALVOLIO IN
SHAKESPEARE'S 12TH NIGHT.
I AM PLEASED TO HAVE HIM HERE IN
THIS TABLE.
HOW IS IT TO BE ON BROADWAY IN
THIS REMARKABLE PRODUCTION AND
LAYING WITH -- 
STEPHEN: IT IS REMARKABLE NOT
JUST BECAUSE IT IS THE GREATEST
STAGE ACTING IN THE WORLD, MARK
RYLANCE PLAYING RICHARD THE
THIRD, IT IS A DOUBLE BILL.
THE GREAT SAM WANAMAKER, WE HAD
TO BRING IN SLIGHTLY.
THE GLOBE HAD BEEN LIKE A TABLE.
IT WAS LIKE A WOODEN O, AND TV
IS A WOODEN O.
THAT IS LIKE EXPANDING IT.
SO YOU HAVE HALF OF IT ANYWAY
HIS PEOPLE STANDING.
IT IS THE YARD, AND THEY ARE
CALLED THE GROUNDLINGS.
THEY WOULD PAY A PENNY.
THERE WERE GRANDER PEOPLE,
ARISTOCRACY WOULD SIT AND WATCH.
IS MORE OR LESS THE SAME NOW.
PEOPLE QUEUE FOR A LONG TIME IN
LINE TO GET A STANDING UP SEATS
, BECAUSE THEY LOVE IT.
AND THE RELATIONSHIP YOU HAVE
WITH THE AUDIENCE IS, THERE IS
NOTHING LIKE IT.
YOU REALIZE EVERY SOLILOQUY IS A
CONVERSATION.
CHARLIE: IT IS AN ALL-MALE CAST.
STEPHEN: IT IS LIKE AN ORIGINAL
PRACTICES CAST.
SO EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT OF THE
PLAY IS AS FAR AS DRASTICALLY WE
KNOW, ABSOLUTELY AS IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN IN SHAKESPEARE'S DAY.
WE ALSO NOTE 12 NIGHT WAS
PERFORMED INDOORS, IN A TEMPLE,
ONE OF THE HOLES, MEDIEVAL HOLES
THE -- HALLS USED BY LAWYERS.
WE KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
BECAUSE IT HAS NOT CHANGED.
AND IT HAPPENED A LOT BECAUSE IT
WAS PRETTY FAMOUS.
DURING THE HOURS OF DAYLIGHT,
YOU CAN USE THE WOODEN THEATER,
BUT YOU HAVE THE REST OF THE
YEAR TO KEEP YOUR ACTORS AND
FROM STARVATION.
SO YOU 02 LAWYERS -- YOU GO TO
LAWYERS HALLS AND PLAY YOUR
PLAY.
AND THIS NEW ONE WAS CLEARLY
WRITTEN FOR INDOOR.
YOU CAN SORT OF TELL.
AND FOR INTELLIGENT LAWYERS AND
PEOPLE TO COME WATCH, WHICH IS
NOT TO SAY IT IS A VERY
DIFFICULT PLAY.
IT IS HILARIOUS, AND IS FAST.
CHARLIE: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
YOUR CHARACTER, BUT LET ME GO
BACK.
DID YOU WANT TO BE A SIX.
SCHOLAR? 
-- DID YOU WANT TO BE A
SHAKESPEAREAN SCHOLAR? 
CAMBRIDGE.
STEPHEN: I FOUND IT EASIEST TO
WRITE ON SHAKESPEARE, I LOVED
HIS PLAYS, PERFORMING THEM AT
CAMBRIDGE.
I THOUGHT I WOULD DO A THESIS,
DOCTORAL THESIS ON SOME ASPECT
OF SHAKESPEARE.
AND GO TO A CORNER OF THE
COLLEGE SOMEWHERE.
ONE OF MY CONTEMPORARIES HAS
BECOME THE GREATEST
SHAKESPEAREAN SCHOLAR IN
BRITAIN, JONATHAN BATES.
CHARLIE: TALK TO ME ABOUT THE
PART.
MALVOLIO? 
STEPHEN: MALVOLIO.
VERY SOME -- VERY HARD TO SAY
WHO IS RIGHT.
AMERICAN ENGLISH IS SAID TO BE
THE CURRENT ENGLISH OF
SHAKESPEARE.
MALVOLIO MEANS, IT IS SORT OF
LATIN, AND IT MEANS ILL WILL.
THIS CHARACTER, WHICH MEANS ILL
DISPOSED.
ALSO RATHER BIZARRELY THERE ARE
THESE AND A GRAMMATIC
CONNECTIONS -- ANAGRAMATIC WITH
VIOLA AND MALVOLIO.
VIOLA IS IN MOURNING AND THAT
HER BROTHER DIES.
SO SHE IS IN CHARGE OF THIS VAST
ESTATE AND SHE HAS A STEWARD,
MALVOLIO.
AND SHE HAS AN UNCLE, UNCLE
TOBY, WHO IS AT DRINKER.
AND SHE HAS A CHAMBERMAID AND A
FOOL WHO TELLS US THINGS YOU
DON'T LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT.
AND THE NEARBY DUKE IS DEEPLY
INTO LOVE WITH HER, BUT HE
SWEARS IN SEVEN YEARS YOU WILL
WEAR A VEIL.
THE SHIPWRECK HAPPENS WHERE HER
TWIN BROTHER AND SISTER, EACH
BELIEVE THE OTHER DROWNED.
THE SISTER COMES UP AND THE SEA
CAPTAIN WHO HAS RESCUED HER, SHE
SAID, WHAT CAN A WOMAN TO ON HER
OWN, WHAT IS IT? 
OH, MY BROTHER IS DROWNED, HOW
WILL I GET BACK TO WHERE I COME
FROM? 
I HAVE THIS TRUNK OF CLOTHES
WITH MY BROTHER CLOTHES.
ADDRESS ME AS A MAN, TAKE ME --
DRESS ME AS A MAN, TAKE ME TO
THE LOCAL PLACE.
AND THIS MAN IS A UNIT, SO
PROBABLY A BLACK BOY.
SHE DRESSES AS A BOY, CALLED
HERSELF ROSARIO.
AND THEN OLIVIA STARTS TO FALL
IN LOVE, BUT WE KNOW SHE IS A
GIRL.
AND SEBASTIAN HAS SURVIVED AND
LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME, AND HE
IS BEING TAKEN AWAY BY ANTONIO,
AN OLD PIRATE.
WE DON'T KNOW HOW, BUT IT IS
USED BY THOSE WHO PUSH THE
HOMOEROTIC NATURE OF
SHAKESPEARE.
HE TALKS ABOUT ABSOLUTE DEVOTION
AND LOVE, PURE LOVE OF
SEBASTIAN.
THEY NEVER MEET UNTIL THE FINAL,
ABSOLUTELY FARCICAL MOMENTS
WHERE THEY ARE ON STAGE AT THE
SAME TIME LOOKING IDENTICAL.
AND ANTONIO, HE SAYS SEBASTIAN,
ARE YOU? 
HE SAYS, HOW CAN YOU TELL? 
HE SAID, HOW HAVE YOU DIVIDED
YOURSELF? 
AND THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER, AND
THE CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
AND IT MEANS THAT VIOLA CAN
ACTUALLY MANDATE -- MARY
SEBASTIAN, WHO LOOKS EXACTLY THE
SAME AS THE GIRL SHE WANTED TO
MARRY, AND THE GIRL TO MARRY THE
DUKE.
AND I HAVE A TERRIBLE TRICK
PLAYED ON ME BECAUSE I AM A
SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME, A
PURITAN.
I AM DESCRIBED AS A CURATIVE.
HE TALKS ABOUT THE DEVIL,
WHETHER HE THINKS WILL IMPRESS
PEOPLE.
BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T LIKE OTHER
PEOPLE.
I LIKE TO BE THE BOSS, AND I AM
PLEASED WITH MYSELF AND ASSUME
EVERY BUDDY ADORES ME.
THEY PLAY THIS VERY, VERY CRUEL
TRICK ON ME.
IT LOOKS AS IF IT IS A SECRET
FROM OLIVIA, THE COUNTESS, TO ME
TO SAY SHE LOVES ME AND TELLING
ME TO WHERE PARTICULAR CLOTHES
-- WEAR PARTICULAR CLOTHES.
AND TO SMILE ALL THE TIME.
AND SHE HATES THE OTHER PERSON,
AND DOES NOT LIKE PEOPLE SMILING
WHEN SHE IS GRIEVING FOR HER
BROTHER.
SO IT IS ULTIMATELY MALVOLIO THE
FOOL WHO ENDS UP IN PRISON.
CHARLIE: TELL ME HOW YOU
APPROACHED, AND WHAT WAS IT FOR
YOU AS AN ACTOR TO GET INSIDE OF
MALVOLIO? 
STEPHEN: SOME PEOPLE MENTION HE
IS US POMPOUS -- A POMPOUS, SELF
REGARDING ASS.
PEOPLE OFTEN FIND IT
PRETENTIOUS.
OUR JOB IS SIMPLY TO ENTERTAIN
PEOPLE.
WE DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO
EXPLAIN THE PROCESS, BUT PEOPLE
ASK SO WE RIGHTFULLY AND HER.
AND YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE -- WE
RIGHTFULLY ANSWER.
AND YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THESE
ARE REAL PEOPLE.
IN GENERAL -- MOBILE YOU THINKS
HE IS TAKING THE HOUSE --
MALVOLIO THINKS HE IS TAKING
CARE OF THE HOUSE.
HE THINKS HE WOULD MAKE A
WONDERFUL HUSBAND FOR OLIVIA AND
THINKS IT THERE IS AN EXAMPLE,
THE LADY OF THE STRAIGHT MARRIED
THE WARDROBE.
THERE ARE LOCAL REFERENCES TO
TIMES WHEN A SERVANT HAS MARRIED
THE MISTRESS OR MASTER.
SO HE JUST GOES OFF INTO A
FANTASYLAND.
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE PLAYED HIM
QUITE WICKED OR HIGHLY COMIC.
CHARLIE: THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
♪
♪
CHARLIE: JOHN LYTHGOE IS HERE.
HE HAS WON EMMYS AND TONY AWARDS
ON STAGE, TWICE OSCAR-NOMINATED
FOR HIS WORK IN FILM.
HE IS PLAYING ONE OF THE MOST
DEMANDING AND CHALLENGING PARTS
EVER WRITTEN FOR THE STAGE.
OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW I AM TALKING
ABOUT KING LEAR.
THIS IS A SHAKESPEARE IN THE
PARK PRODUCTION AT DELACORTE
THEATER IN NEW YORK CENTRAL PARK
THROUGH AUGUST 17.
I AM VERY PLEASED TO HAVE JOHN
LITHGOW ON THIS PROGRAM.
JOHN: GREAT TO BE HERE, CHARLIE.
CHARLIE: HOW DOES JOHN AND KING
LEAR COME HERE TOGETHER? 
JOHN: THE PLATE IS MUCH GREATER
THAN I AM.
I HAVE BEEN NAGGING SOMEONE TO
CONSIDER ME FOR IT.
PROBABLY, THE FIRST I MENTIONED
IT TO HIM IS PROBABLY LONG
BEFORE I SHOULD HAVE PLAYED IT.
BUT NOW I THINK I HAVE JUST
ENTERED THAT INTERESTING WINDOW
OF OPPORTUNITY FOR LEAR, WHEN
YOUR YOUNG ENOUGH TO PLAY IT
WHEN YOU STILL HAVE THE STRENGTH
BUT OLD ENOUGH TO PLAY IT
BECAUSE YOU CAN BRING
AUTHENTICITY TO AN OLD MAN
LOSING HIS VIABILITY.
I KNOW IT BETTER THAN I EVEN
REALIZED.
I HAVE SEEN IT SO MANY TIMES IN
MY LIFE.
I PLAYED IT IN COLLEGE.
BUT I FIGURED IT IS GOING TO BE
SUCH A DEMANDING PART.
THE REHEARSAL PERIOD IS GOING
TO BE SO, SO TOUGH.
THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO IS
TO GO HOME AND STUDY WORDS AT
NIGHT.
SO I LEARNED IT COMPLETELY COLD
ON THE FIRST DAY OF REVERSAL.
THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER DONE
THAT.
SURE ENOUGH, I MEAN, IT WAS A
PROCESS OF STAMINA BUILDING,
REHEARSING IT.
CHARLIE: TALK ABOUT LEARNING.
YOU HAD A UCLA STUDENT COMING
IN, HE WOULD YOU USE A YOU KNEW
THE LINES THAT LED TO -- HE
WOULD CUE YOU SO YOU KNEW THE
LINES TO COME IN? 
JOHN: IN MY DAYS ON THIRD ROCK
FROM THE SUN, I WORKED OUT AN
EXTREMELY EFFICIENT WAY OF
MEMORIZING GREAT GOBS OF
MATERIAL BECAUSE IT CAME AT YOU
VERY FAST AND WAS VERY WORDY AND
FAST-PACED SHOW.
I TRAINED MY ASSISTANT TO FEED
ME MY LINES WITH A THREE MINUTE
PAUSE, THREE SECOND PAUSE
BETWEEN EVERY SINGLE WORD.
AND I WOULD DRILL THE LINE IN
ALL THOSE PAUSES, AND I CAN
LEARN A SPEECH LIKE THAT ONCE
THROUGH.
THAT IS HOW I WENT ABOUT
STUDYING.
CHARLIE: THE IDEA OF MEMORIZING
THINGS IS A GREAT FASCINATION
FOR ME.
JOHN: IT GETS HARDER AS YOU GET
OLDER.
CHARLIE: MAKING SPEECHES.
JOHN: YES, RIGHT, THAT WHOLE
THING.
WITH LEAR, THERE IS ALSO A
SERVER PER -- SUPERB INTERNAL
LOGIC TO THE WRITING.
I HAVE ABSORBED IT OVER THE
YEARS, ALL THOSE BRILLIANT AND
VIVID SPEECHES.
CHARLIE: WHAT IS THE CHALLENGE
OF PLAYING IT OUTSIDE? 
JOHN: IT IS LESS OF A CHALLENGE
THAN A MARVELOUS OPPORTUNITY.
IT IS A BIG PLAY FULL OF
GIGANTIC PASSIONS AND GIGANTIC
IDEAS, AND I AM A VERY, VERY
TOLERABLE ACTOR.
IT IS AS BIG AS THE BIG
OUTDOORS.
AT THE DELACORTE WITH HIS HUNGRY
AUDIENCE, AN AUDIENCE OF
PASSIONATE NEW YORK THEATERGOERS
WHO HAVE WAITED ALL DAY TO GET
THEIR TICKETS, THEY ARE SO
HUNGRY FOR IT, THEY ARE
COMPLETELY GRIPPED BY IT.
WHEN THE ELEMENTS COME ALONG, WE
HAD TWO NIGHTS OF RAIN, AND YET
WE PERFORMED THE THING ANYWAY,
THEY STAY RIGHT WITH US.
IN FACT, THEY THINK IT IS EVEN
BETTER.
AFTER ALL, I DO GET TO SAY "BLOW
WINDS." 
CHARLIE: THE IDEA OF SO MANY
GREAT ACTORS PERFORMING THIS,
DID PREPARATION INCLUDE
WATCHING, UNDERSTANDING, LOOKING
AT THOSE PERFORMANCES NOT TOO
INTERPRETED -- NOT TO COPY THEM
BUT TO UNDERSTAND THE RANGE OF
INVITATION -- OF INTERPRETATION?
JOHN: I CALCULATED THIS OVER THE
YEARS, AND YOU REMEMBER ALL
SORTS OF THINGS ABOUT INDIVIDUAL
PERFORMANCES.
THE MOST VIVID I THINK WITH THE
VERY FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES I
SIZE, I SAW -- COUPLE OF TIMES I
SAW, I SAW POLSKA APPEALED DO
IT.
THAT WAS LOOK -- PAUL SCOFFIELD
DO IT.
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF LEARS,
AND I STOPPED SEEING THEM.
THE LAST ONE WAS DEREK JACOBI.
I DID NOT SEE FRANK GORE SIMON
RUSSELL BEALE OR OTHERS.
BUT AT SOME POINT I HAD TO MAKE
IT COMPLETELY MY OWN WITH NO ONE
SITTING ON MY SHOULDER.
CHARLIE: DID YOU SEE IT, WHAT
THE PRODUCTION PUT ON BY YOUR
FATHER? 
JOHN: NO, HE DID NOT PUT IT ON,
BUT WHEN HE PUT KING LEAR ON, I
WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD.
MY PARENTS YOU I WOULDN'T LAST
TO THE END.
NO, THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT WAS
IN 1962, THE FIRST SEASON OF
SHAKESPEARE IN THE PARK AT THE
DELACORTE WITH FRANK SILVERA IN
THE ROLE.
AND HE COMPLETELY THROTTLED ME.
THAT, YOU REMEMBER, YOU REMEMBER
JUST THE IMPACT OF A PLAY LIKE
THIS.
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I SAW
DEATH OF A SALESMAN.
CHARLIE: ARE THERE OTHER THINGS
YOU VERY MUCH WANT TO PLAY THAT
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS
YOU HAVE DONE, ARE THERE MISSING
ELEMENTS FOR YOU IN TERMS OF
GREAT CHARACTERS? 
JOHN: I WOULD SAY THE ONLY ONE
WASJOHN: KING LEAR.
I DON'T HAVE ANY BUCKET LIST TO
PLAY OR PART ANYMORE.
I AM ABOUT TO DO A DELICATE
BALANCE ON BROADWAY, AND I AM
THRILLED TO BE DOING THAT, BUT
IT IS NOT SOMETHING I AM WAITING
MY WHOLE CAREER TO DO.
KING LEAR IS.
IN MY EXPERIENCE, ALL OF THE
MOST EXCITING THINGS I HAVE DONE
HAVE BEEN OTHER PEOPLE'S BRIGHT
IDEAS, THINGS THAT I NEVER EVEN
THOUGHT OF MYSELF FOR.
OTHER PEOPLE THINK OF YOU IN
WAYS THAT YOU DON'T, SOMETIMES
IN WAYS YOU DON'T THINK OF
YOURSELF.
CHARLIE: TELL ME WHO HE IS, WHO
IS LEAR?
JOHN: IN OUR LEAR, WE SEE HIM AS
A VERY EXUBERANT AND MANIC AND
EXCITING MAN, BELOVED MONARCH.
BUT HE IS AGING TO THE POINT
WHERE HE IS PROBABLY ALWAYS HAD
A STRAIN OF MANIC TEMPER.
AND IT IS DAN SULLIVAN'S
WONDERFUL CONCEPT, IN MY OPINION
, THE FIRST TIME YOU SEE HIM HE
IS EXTREMELY EXCITED ABOUT THIS
PLAN FOR DIVIDING HIS KINGDOM.
LIKE IT IS SOMETHING HE HAS NOT
REALLY THOUGHT THROUGH YET.
AND HIS FOOL IS IN THE SCENE.
YOU GET A SENSE OF HIM BEING A
VERY ROBUST MAN WITH A HUGE,
OPEN HEART, AND A GREAT SENSE OF
HUMOR, BUT HE HAS AGED MORE THAN
PEOPLE REALIZE.
CHARLIE: SOME PEOPLE ASK THE
QUESTION, IS HE MAD FROM THE
BEGINNING, OR DOES HE LOSE HIS
MIND OVER THE PROCESS OF THE
PLAY? 
JOHN: THAT IS ANNEXED TO A GOOD
QUESTION, AND IS THE NUMBER ONE
CHALLENGE IS CALCULATING HOW HE
GOES MAD.
THERE IS BEGINNINGS OF A
PROPENSITY OF MADNESS.
I THINK WHEN HE EXPLODES
COMPLETELY IRRATIONALLY AT
CORDELIA, IT IS A SHOCK TO HER.
SHE HAS PROBABLY SEEN HIS TEMPER
BEFORE, BUT SHE HAS NEVER SEEN
HIM LIKE THIS.
SHE HAS NEVER SEEN HIM THAT
INSANE.
THIS IS THE FIRST IN HIS WHOLE
LIFE -- THE PERSON IN HIS WHOLE
LIFE HE LOVES THE MOST, AND IT
IS BECAUSE OF THE INTENSITY OF
THAT LOVE THAT HIS ANGER HAS
SUCH A REACTION.
FOR EVERYONE, IT IS A NEW SHOCK.
THEY TALK ABOUT HOW WE ARE
SEEING MORE AND MORE OF THIS.
AND THEN IN SUCCEEDING SCENES,
YOU SEE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF
MADNESS AS HE DECLINES INTO A
REAL DERANGEMENT AND DEMENTIA,
AND THE ENTIRE CHALLENGE WITH
THEM, SULLIVAN'S LIKE EXQUISITE
GUIDANCE, IS JUST FINDING THOSE
BENCHMARKS, FINDING THE MOMENTS.
FOR AN EXAMPLE, THE MOMENT WHEN
HIS MADNESS, HE HAS THESE HUGE
TEMPER TANTRUMS WITH HIS
DAUGHTERS, ALL THREE OF THEM.
THAT PROPELLED HIM A CERTAIN
DISTANCE TOWARDS MADNESS.
BUT THEN HE IS SHOT OUT IN A
WILD AND CRAZY STORM.
THEN HE MEETS A MAD BEGGAR, AND
THE SIGHT OF THAT MAD BEGGAR,
POOR TOM, WHO IS EDGAR IN
DISGUISE, SORT OF TAKES IT ALL
INTO YET ANOTHER DEGREE.
SUDDENLY HE SEES, THIS IS THE
SOLUTION.
THIS IS AN ON ACCOMMODATED MAN,
NO MORE WITH SUCH A BORE -- POOR
BEAR FOUR.
HE IS GOING MAD.
IT IS TAKING HIM TOWARD -- 
CHARLIE: AS HE IS GOING MAD, IT
IS TAKING HIM TO SOME SORT OF --
JOHN: YEAH, MADNESS IS VISION.
IT IS CAUTERIZING WOUNDS,
CLEARING HIS BRAIN.
CHARLIE: WHEN YOU RECITE
SHAKESPEARE, WHEN YOU SPEAK
SHAKESPEARE, WHAT DO YOU FEEL? 
JOHN: I AM SO IN TOUCH WITH THE
GODS OF EXPRESSION.
JOHN: I FEEL LIKE IT IS A
MUSICIAN, SIGHTREADING HARMLESS
CHAMBER MUSIC.
A LOT OF SHAKESPEARE IS VERY
FAMILIAR TO ME BY NOW, SO IT IS
LIKE A LOT OF CLASSICAL MUSIC IS
FAMILIAR TO MUSICIANS, IT IS
JUST, I READ THOSE SPEECHES.
THERE IS THIS INCREDIBLE
INTERSECTION OF POETRY AND
EMOTION THAT SHAKESPEARE, TO BE,
HE IS THE VERY BEST EXAMPLE OF
THAT.
YOU CAN LOOK AT IT PURELY IN
TERMS OF THE BEAUTY OF THE
LANGUAGE, OR YOU CAN LOOK AT IT
IN TERMS OF THE POWER.
CHARLIE: THE MEANING.
JOHN: AND SHAKESPEARE'S
EXTRAORDINARY EMPATHY.
HE MANAGED TO DO THE SAME THING
WITH THE SAME PHRASES, YOU KNOW,
THAT THING I JUST QUOTED YOU.
CHARLIE: WHERE DO YOU PUT LEAR
IN ALL OF THE CHARACTERS YOU
HAVE PLAYED IN SHAKESPEARE? 
JOHN: I ACTUALLY HAVE NOT DONE
THAT MUCH.
CHARLIE: HOW MANY HAVE YOU DONE?
JOHN: I HAVE DONE ABOUT 20
PLAYS, BUT MOST OF IT WAS BEFORE
I WAS 20 YEARS OLD AND IN SMALL
ROLES.
I DID PLAY MACBETH IN COLLEGE.
I PLAYED MALVOLIO WITH THE ROYAL
SHAKESPEARE COMPANY A FEW YEARS
AGO.
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I
HAVE TAKEN ON ONE OF THE
GIGANTIC ROLES.
CHARLIE: IS IT SOMETHING YOU
WISH YOU HAD DONE MORE? 
JOHN: I STUPIDLY TURNED DOWN
HAMLET A FEW TIMES.
I HAD OTHER THINGS TO DO.
CHARLIE: WAS IT THINGS LIKE
TELEVISION? 
JOHN: I THINK IT WAS OTHER PLAYS
OR -- 
CHARLIE: THERE IS THIS SORT OF
THING THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT OF
THE THEATER THINK -- THAT WOULD
BE ME -- THAT EVERY ACTOR FEELS
LIKE IT IS WORTH HIS SOUL, I
HAVE TO TAKE ON HAMLET.
YOU DID NOT FEEL THAT? 
JOHN: I DID NOT HAVE A BURNING
DESIRE.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, TO BE
HONEST, WHAT I LIKE WORKING ON
MOST IS NEW MATERIAL.
I LOVE WORKING WITH WRITERS AND
CREATING SOMETHING THAT NOBODY
HAS SEEN BEFORE.
I THINK THERE MAY BE SOMETHING
BEAUTIFUL GOING ON.
THIS IS VERY MUCH MY FATHER'S
WORLD.
AND I, AND I AM A TERRIBLE SNOB.
I ONLY WANT TO BE IN GREAT
PRODUCTIONS OF SHAKESPEARE.
CHARLIE: THANK YOU FOR JOINING
US, SEE YOU NEXT TIME.

TODAY, I'M JOINED BY THE
LEGENDARY MIKE BARNICLE.
>> GIVEN TRUMP'S HISTORY AND
EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED
DURING THE COURSE OF THIS
CAMPAIGN AND ALL THE REST, TRUMP
IS GOING TO TALK TO
AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS.
DOES HE HAVE A CHANCE OF DOING
RESPECTIVELY WELL WITH
AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS?
CAN HE GET TO ROMNEY LEVELS?
>> HE CANNOT.
HE LACKS FAMILIARITY WITH
AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS IN THIS
COUNTRY.
THE THINGS THEY ARE FAMILIAR
WITH HIM ABOUT, THAT IS ONE
THING.
THE THINGS THAT THEY ARE ALSO
FAMILIAR WITH HIM ABOUT DO NOT
WORK TO HIS FAVOR.
HE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT
GETTING THE BLACK VOTE AND
APPEALING TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS
WHILE STANDING BEFORE GROUPS
THAT LOOK LIKE THE ADMISSION
COMMITTEE'S FURTHER THE AUGUSTA
NATIONAL AND SOMETIMES, HIS
TWEETS CAN BE MISREAD BY PEOPLE.
>> TRUMP POINT BEFORE WHITE
AUDIENCES AND TALKED ABOUT BLACK
VOTERS IN CONDESCENDING WAYS.
SOME SAID THAT THE FIRST THING
THAT HE HAD TO DO WAS TALK TO
BLACK AUDIENCES AND YOU SHOULD
GIVE HIM CREDIT.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT MOST MAFIC
-- MOST AFRICAN-AMERICANS KNOW
THAT HE SPENT HALF THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION AS ATTACKING
OBAMA AS ILLEGITIMATE AND, FOR
MOST AFRICAN-AMERICANS THAT I
KNOW AND FOR MANY ACROSS THE
COUNTRY, IT HAS PUT THEM OUT OF
REACH FOR DONALD TRUMP FOREVER.
THEY REGARD THAT AS RACIST.
>> DONALD TRUMP PURSUED THIS
WITH A VEHEMENCE THAT WAS CRUEL
AND STUPID, IN RETROSPECT.
>> THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN HAS A NEW
NICKNAME FOR HILLARY.
"HIDING HILLARY." 
TODAY, THE 260TH DAY, THERE WERE
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CLINTON
FOUNDATION AND THE CLINTON TEAM
HAS RESPONDED TO CALLS FOR PRESS
ACCESS BY SAYING THAT SHE HAS
GIVEN INTERVIEWS WITH 2600
QUESTIONS IN 2016.
WHILE WE ARE ON THE TOPIC OF THE
CLINTONS AND THE PRESS, THERE
WAS A PLANE THAT WAS SEPARATE
FROM THE PRESS CORPS.
IN THE 1960'S, THE PRESS
TRAVELED ON THE CANDIDATES'
PLANES.
THERE HAVE BEEN DISAGREEMENTS
ABOUT WHETHER PRESS CONFERENCES
ARE A THING OF THE PAST IN THE
DIGITAL AGE.
>> THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT
THE ONLY REASON YOU CARE ABOUT
THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE PRESS.
SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE TRUE
AND WE DO HAVE THE ELEMENTS OF
THE GRANDSTANDING REPORTERS.
ONE OF THEM, YOU SEE RIGHT HERE.
>> WHERE?
>> BEHIND YOU.
HILLARY CLINTON HAS A SITUATION
WHERE SHE HAS TO ADDRESS PEOPLE
WITH REGULARITY AND SHE DOES NOT
HAVE CONTROLS OR CONSTRAINTS
OVER THE INTERVIEW.
IT IS DIFFERENT THAN A
ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEW.
IT IS A FREE-FLOWING THING AND
SHE IS QUESTIONED BY PEOPLE WHO
KNOW HER BEST.
BOTH CANDIDATES SHOULD DO THIS.
>> I AGREE WITH YOU, ALMOST
COMPLETELY.
THE PRINCIPAL REASON FOR A PRESS
CONFERENCE HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH
THE CLINTON GLOBAL INITIATIVE.
IF YOU ARE SITTING AT HOME AND
WATCHING THIS PROGRAM, YOU WANT
TO KNOW WHAT HILLARY CLINTON IS
GOING TO DO ABOUT SYRIA AND
ALEPPO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN AND AROUND
THE GLOBE IN THESE SITUATIONS?
YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT.
>> THE LOGICAL EXTENSION OF THIS
IS, SHE HAS NOT BEEN ASKED
QUESTIONS VERY OFTEN AND THERE
ARE BETTER CHANCES OF HER
GETTING THESE QUESTIONS, IF SHE
MEETS THE PRESS.
DONALD TRUMP CALLED ON HILLARY
CLINTON TO RELEASE RECORDS.
THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN RESPONDED
AND THEY SAID THAT THEY HAVE
RELEASED MORE INFORMATION AND
THAT "HEALTH" HAS BEEN AN
ADJECTIVE-LADEN LETTER FROM HIS
PHYSICIAN.
LISTEN TO HIS DOCTOR DESCRIBE
WRITING THE LETTER.
>> I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS ALL DAY
AND I GET RUSHED AND I WAS
ANXIOUS.
I TRIED TO GET IT DOWN.
>> I THINK SOME OF THE WORDS DID
NOT COME OUT EXACTLY AS PLANNED.
>> YOU THINK HE IS THE BEST.
IT WORKS OUT JUST FINE.
>> THERE ARE ARGUMENTS ABOUT
TRANSPARENCY.
ON THE QUESTION OF HEALTH.
TRUMP IS GOING ON OFFENSE.
WHO HAS THE UPPER HAND?
>> YOU JUST SAW WILLIE NELSON AS
A DOCTOR.
>> THAT WAS WILLIE NELSON AND
THE DUDE FROM THE LEBOWSKI.
>> I DO MY OWN GROCERY SHOPPING
AND I MEET ORDINARY PEOPLE.
THIS CAMPAIGN IS SCARY, WITHOUT
PONDERING THESE HEALTH
STATEMENTS.
WE HAVE TO KNOW THEIR PHYSICAL
HEALTH.
THE MENTAL HEALTH IS ON EXHIBIT
EVERY DAY.
DONALD IS LOSING.
>> I FIND IT TROUBLING.
HILLARY CLINTON COULD TURN
AROUND AND SAY THAT SHE IS HAPPY
TO RELEASE THESE.
BUT IT IS TRUE.
HILLARY HAS RELEASED MORE THAN
HE HAS, AND THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
MIKE: WAS THAT A REAL DOCTOR?
JOHN: THIS ASTERISK KNOWLEDGE OF
OR WHATEVER, PRETENDING TO BE
HIS INTERNIST.
ACCORDING TO THAT MAN, THE
HEALTHIEST MAN TO ENTER THE
OFFICE OF PRESIDENT FOREVER.
MIKE: IT IS NO WONDER THAT I
ALSO AGREE WITH YOUR INSTINCT,
HAVING SEEN THAT DR. AND THIS
DISCUSSION.
THE ODDS ON 10 TO BE LOW.
THIS BACK AND FORTH HAS BECOME
-- 
JOHN: LUDICROUS, EVEN THAT WE
ARE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION IS
KIND OF CRAZY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT
DOCTOR? WOULD YOU LET THAT GUY
TREAT YOU?
MIKE: HE HAS BEEN MY POSITION
FOR MANY YEARS.
LOOK AT ME.
I AM THE PICTURE OF HEALTH.
AND A HILLARY CLINTON WORKER HAS
ANNOUNCED SHE IS SEPARATING FROM
ANTHONY WEINER.
NORMALLY, THIS WOULD NOT WARRANT
OUR ATTENTION ON THE SHOW, BUT
TODAY, DONALD TRUMP MADE IT
POLITICAL, BY APPLAUDING ABEDIN,
TALKING ABOUT ALLOWING ANTHONY
WEINER SUCH CLOSE PROXIMITY TO
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.
JOHN, DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO
WORK THIS INTO THE NEWS.
DOES THIS HAVE ANY POLITICAL
RELEVANCE WHATSOEVER?
JOHN: NO.
MIKE: I AGREE.
JOHN: IN TERMS OF THIS MATTERING
TO ANYBODY OUT THERE IN AMERICA
WHO IS DETERMINING WHO THE NEXT
PRESIDENT SHOULD BE, AND IT DOES
NOT MATTER.
MIKE: WE WILL MOVE ON.
JOHN: OK, EVERYTHING COLIN
KAEPERNICK RELATED.
STAY TUNED.
