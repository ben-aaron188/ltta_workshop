RAMY: I'M RAMY INOCENCIO IN FOR
EMILY CHANG AND THIS IS
"BLOOMBERG WEST."
INVESTORS DITCHING HP.
PLUS FLYING TO APPLE'S DEFENSE
IN A TAX DISPUTE IN EUROPE.
AND WHAT ARE PUBLIC MARKET
INVESTORS LOOKING FOR WHEN THEY
DECIDE TO BACK A STARTUP?
WE WILL LOOK AT OUR WEEKLY
INVESTING ROUNDTABLE.
FIRST TO OUR LEAD -- SHARES OF
HP ARE LOWER IN AFTER-HOURS
TRADING.
THIS IS THE SIDE OF THE COMPANY
FORMALLY KNOWN -- FORMERLY KNOWN
AS HEWLETT-PACKARD AND IS KNOWN
FOR ITS PRINTERS.
IT BEAT ESTIMATES AND SALES OF
COMPUTERS WERE FLAT.
GUIDANCE FOR THE FULL YEAR
MISSED ANALYST EXPECTATIONS.
JOINING US TO DIG INTO THE
FUTURE OF HP PRINTERS AS
COMPUTERS IS OUR BLOOMBERG
CONTRIBUTOR EDITOR DAVID
KIRKPATRICK AND ARE SENIOR
ANALYST.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE EARNINGS --
HOW BAD WAS THIS?
GUEST: THE QUALITY OF THE
NUMBERS WAS VERY NEXT.
THERE WAS A LOT OF INVENTORY
RESHUFFLE IN THE CHANNEL.
I THOUGHT EXECUTION IS GETTING
BETTER AND THEY ARE FOCUSING ON
THE RIGHT THING, BUT Q3 WAS OK
AND Q4 GUIDANCE, I THOUGHT THE
PC BUSINESS PERFORMED WELL AND
THEY ARE FOCUSING ON THE RIGHT
THING, THEY ARE FOCUSING ON THE
RIGHT THING AND IN THE PRINTING
BUSINESS, THEY ARE TAKING A
DIFFERENT TACK IN THAT THEY ARE
WILLING TO PLACE WEAKER PROFIT
PRINTERS FOR THE SUPPLY CONTRACT
IN THE LONG RUN.
I THINK IT IS ALL THE RIGHT
FOCUS THERE'S A LOT OF MESSINESS
NEAR TERM THAT SHOVELS OUT.
RAMY: UBS CAME OUT WITH A NOTE
POINTING OUT 80% OF ITS PROFITS
CAME FROM PRINTERS WHICH I FOUND
QUITE SURPRISING BECAUSE WHEN
YOU THINK ABOUT HP -- I HAD HP
COMPUTER YEARS AGO AND I WAS
THINKING OF THAT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IN TERMS OF
DIVERSIFICATION?
DAVID: THEY ARE NOT A VERY
DIVERSIFIED COMPANY AT THE
MOMENT.
I THINK THEY ARE IN A FITTING
FROM THE SEPARATION OF THE OTHER
PART OF HP AND WE CAN FOCUS ON
THESE BUSINESSES AND THE THAT
THEY ARE HAVING GROWTH IN THE PC
BUSINESS NOW AND GET CREDIT FOR
THAT.
I WAS OUT THERE JUST LAST WEEK
BY COINCIDENCE AND THEY HAVE
SOME PRETTY COOL TECHNOLOGY
COMING OUT OF THEIR PRINTER
BUSINESS, A LOT OF WHICH IS
RELATED TO GOING TOWARD DIGITAL
PRINTING WHICH IS EXTREMELY
SOPHISTICATED.
THEY HAVE TECHNOLOGY FOR DIGITAL
EQUIPMENT THAT IS
STATE-OF-THE-ART AND COULD
GENERATE GREAT GROWTH
OPPORTUNITY.
RAMY: YOU WERE TALKING EARLIER
ABOUT 3-D PRINTING AND
SEMI-CONDUCTORS.
DAVID: THEY HAVE 3-D PRINTING
TECHNOLOGY THEY CLAIM IS
SUPERIOR TO ANYONE AND CAN BED
THEN INTO THE DEVICES THEY
CREATE.
THEY USE THE SAME PRINTER HEADS
THEY USE FOR THEIR BIG
INDUSTRIAL PRINTERS IN THE 3-D
PRINTERS, SO THEY ARE ABLE TO
LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY THEY ALREADY
HAVE TWO GET INTO WHAT COULD BE
A NEW BUSINESS.
RAMY: DO YOU THINK THIS IS THE
FUTURE?
GUEST: I HAVE A LACKADAISICAL
OPINION, TO PUT IT MILDLY.
I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A BIG
ENOUGH MARKET.
3-D PRINTING GENERALLY.
WHAT THEY ARE DOING, GOING AFTER
THE OFFICE PRINTING MARKET, THE
BIG MACHINES IN OFFICES, ON THE
THIRD FLOOR IN THE CORNER, THAT
IS A MARKET HEAVILY CORNERED BY
JAPANESE OFFICE EQUIPMENT
MAKERS.
THAT IS AN INTERESTING MARKET
BECAUSE THE DEVICE IS POSSIBLE
AND THE SUPPLIES GOING TO THEM
HAVE A FASTER REFRESH RATE OR
CONSUMPTION RATE AND IT MAKES
FOR A PROFITABLE SUPPLY MARKET.
THAT IS A VERY INTERESTING
MARKET BUT I'M NOT SURE THE 3-D
PRINTING MARKET IS ANYTHING MORE
THAN A SMALL MARKET.
DAVID: I WAS INTRIGUED BY SOME
OF THEIR TECHNOLOGY FOR PRODUCT
TURNING LABELS AND PRINTING JOBS
AND THEY NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO
EMBED UNIQUE CODES INTO AN
INDIVIDUAL UNIT OF A PRODUCT OR
MAGAZINE THAT CAN BE READ WITH A
CAMERA.
IT IS AN INTERESTING NEW SLANT
ON WHAT YOU COULD DO WITH
DIGITAL PRINTING AND THEY CLAIM
THERE IS SOME GROWTH THERE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
GUEST: THE TECHNOLOGY IS COOL
AND NEED BUT IS IT A BIG ENOUGH
OR GET?
THE MARKET NEEDS TO BE LARGE,
PROFITABLE AND GROWING.
HP NEEDS TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES
THAT ARE NOT REALLY COOL.
IT NEEDS TO ATTACK THREE PRONGS
OF ANY MARKET GOES AFTER.
RAMY: WE HAVE SEEN MIGRATION
FROM CONSUMER TO BUSINESS.
LET'S MOVE TO PCS -- IN TERMS OF
LEVELING OFF, TAKE THAT.
GUEST: WE SAW NUMBERS FROM THE
MARKET RESEARCH FIRMS SUGGESTING
THAT THE U.S. FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN YEARS HAD YEAR ON YEAR
GROWTH.
EASY ELEMENTS OF THE PC MARKET
DOING WELL -- GAMING IS DOING
WELL, CONVERTIBLES, CONFESSIONAL
PRO CONSUMERS, IT'S A SMALL
SEGMENT BUT THESE ARE PRICED AT
$1200 OR $1500 AND UP OF.
THERE ARE SEGMENTS AND HP HAS
DONE A BETTER JOB FOCUSING ON
THAT SEGMENT AND IT'S ONE OF THE
TOP THREE FROM A SHARE
PERSPECTIVE, SO IT IS DOING WELL
FOR THE QUESTION IS IS IT
SUSTAINABLE AND WE SAW SOME
STRONG GAINS IN 2014 IN
COMMERCIAL PCS, WHETHER THE
CONSUMER IS READY TO TAKE THE
BATON AND REPLACE THESE VERY OLD
PCS WITH NEW ONES.
RAMY: I WANT TO PULL BACK ON THE
ENTIRE FOCUS.
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HPE AS ONE
ENTITY.
DO YOU THINK THE SPINOFF IS
WORKING FOR THEM?
DAVID: THEY NEED CLARITY ON
THESE IS THIS IS THAT WERE
MUDDIED TOGETHER INTO ONE
COMPOUND HOLE.
HPE IS IN MANY WAYS A SOFTWARE
COMPANY.
I THINK THE FACT HP IS GAINING
MARKET SHARE ON LENOVO WHICH IS
NUMBER ONE IN PCS IS SIGNIFICANT
AND SOMETIMES FOCUS CAN REALLY
BENEFIT A COMPANY AND I THINK
THEY HAVE MORE POTENTIAL FOCUS.
I WOULD BE MILDLY OPTIMISTIC
ABOUT THIS COMPANIES PROSPECT AS
AN INDEPENDENT UNIT.
GUEST: WHEN WE WENT IN TO THE
SECURITY ANALYST, EVERYONE SAID
HBT WAS THE ENTITY TO OWN AND
HPE WAS GOING INTO THE CLOUD
WHERE IT HAD WEAKER POSITIONING.
FAST FORWARD ONE YEAR AND THE
EXACT OPPOSITE HAS OCCURRED.
IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE WHERE
WE GO FROM HERE GIVEN THAT HP
QUEUE HAS TAKEN A BEATING.
IF THEY ARE DOING THE RIGHT WING
AND PRINTERS, THERE COULD BE A
STORY HERE.
DAVID: AND THE STOCK IS UP.
NOT TODAY.
RAMY: WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE.
OUR BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE
REPORTER AND DAVID KIRKPATRICK
IS STAYING WITH US.
GARVIN FALLING ALMOST 6% TODAY
AFTER GOLDMAN SACHS DOWNGRADED
THE STOCK AND HOLD TO A CELL
AMID INCREASED COMPETITION.
THEIR BIGGEST COMPETITORS ARE
FIT AND APPLE, BOTH EXPECTED TO
RELEASE DEVICES LATER THIS YEAR.
COMING UP, TIM COOK MARKS FIVE
YEARS AT THE HELM OF APPLE.
WE WILL TAKE A LOOK BACK AT HIS
TENURE, NEXT.
♪
A MILESTONE FOR THE TOP MAN AT
APPLE -- TIM COOK MARKS HIS FIVE
YEAR ANNIVERSARY AT THE HELM OF
THE WORLD'S MOST PROFITABLE
COMPANY.
WE TAKE A LOOK BACK AT HIS
TENURE.
>> IN AUGUST, 2011, TIM COOK WAS
TAKING OVER FROM A LEGEND.
MANY INVESTORS FEARED THAT
WITHOUT STEVE JOBS AT THE HELM,
APPLE WOULD BE HEADED FOR
DECLINE, BUT FIVE YEARS ON, COOK
HAS DEFINED APPLE IN HIS OWN
WAY.
FIRST OFF, BUSINESS HAS BOOMED
UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP.
APPLE'S MARKET CAP DOUBLED,
SURPASSING EXXON MOBIL TO BECOME
THE WORLD'S MOST VALUABLE
COMPANY, BUT THE STOCK HAS
LAGGED THE AS -- THE NASDAQ AND
HUNDRED.
IN MARCH OF 2012 UNDER PRESSURE
FROM CARL ICAHN, COOK GRANTED
SHAREHOLDERS THEIR FIRST
DIVIDEND IN 17 YEARS PLUS A $10
BILLION BUYBACK SCHEME.
COMPANY DATA SHOWS APPLE CASH
HOLDINGS NEARLY DOUBLED FROM
$121 BILLION TO $232 BILLION.
BUT WITH 93% OF THAT MONEY HELD
OFFSHORE, HE HAS TAKEN HEAT FROM
REGULARS AND THE U.S. SENATE,
ACCUSING APPLE OF USING
SUBSIDIARIES IN IRELAND TO
REDUCE ITS TAX BILL.
NOW TO PRODUCT -- UNDER TIM
COOK, APPLE'S TORY IS ALL ABOUT
THE ICONIC IPHONE.
IN JULY, APPLE SOLD IT BILLION
UNIT AND THE CATEGORY ACCOUNTS
FOR NEARLY 57% OF APPLE'S
REVENUE.
BUT INVESTORS ARE WAITING ON
ANOTHER MAJOR PRODUCT WIN,
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE COMPANY HAS
SEEN IPHONE REVENUES TO CLIMB
FOR THE FIRST -- REVENUE DECLINE
FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS YEAR.
SOME THINK APPLE IS OVER
DEPENDENT ON THE IPHONE AND
WORRY ABOUT THE IMPACT OF
COOLING DEMAND AND CHINA.
THEN THERE IS TIM COOK, A
PERSON.
TIM COOK BECAME THE MOST HIGH
PROFILE OPENLY GAY EXECUTIVE IN
THE U.S. AND HAS BECOME A PUBLIC
ADVOCATE FOR THE LGBT COMMUNITY.
JUST TAKEN A STAND ON PRIVACY,
FACING OFF WITH THE F THE EYE IN
A VERY PUBLIC CONFRONTATION OVER
ENCRYPTION.
AND COOK IS PUSHING CLEAN
CREDENTIALS, FUNDING RENEWABLE
POWER SOURCES FOR THE COMPANY'S
DATA CENTERS AND SETTING
AMBITIOUS RECYCLING TARGETS
WORLD APPLE DEVICES.
WITH TIM COOK HITTING HIS
STRIDE, LET SEE WHAT APPLE'S 
I'VE YEARS WILL LOOK LIKE.
JOHN: GREAT REPORTING THERE.
AS WE JUST MENTIONED, 93% OF
APPLE'S CASH HOLDINGS ARE HELD
OFFSHORE.
IT HAS SPARKED INVESTIGATIONS BY
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION.
AT STAKE, POSSIBLY BILLIONS OF
EUROS IN UNPAID TAXES.
THEY ARE NOW CALLING THE
EUROPEAN COMMISSION A TAX
AUTHORITY THAT THREATENS GLOBAL
TAX REFORM DEALS.
JOINING US TO DISCUSS THIS IS
ALEX WEBB FROM SAN FRANCISCO.
STILL WITH ME IN THE SEO IS
DAVID KIRKPATRICK.
DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS
CRITICISM HERE?
DO YOU THINK IN ALL HONESTY AND
FAIRNESS AS A JOURNALIST, IS IT
WARRANTED?
>> IT SEEMS THIS IS TO SOME
EXTENT A PLAY BETWEEN THE U.S.
TREASURY AND AUTHORITIES IN
EUROPE TO SEE IF THEY ARE GOING
TO PAY THE TAXES WHERE THEY ARE
GOING TO PAY THEM AND THIS IS
THE TREASURY SAYING WE WANT THIS
TO BE PAID HERE, NOT IN EUROPE
AND THEY SUGGESTED IS AN EITHER
OR SCENARIO, NOT US.
RAMY: SHOULD APPLE TO BE ALLOWED
TO DO THAT?
DAVID: ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
AMAZES ME IS THEY HAVE SO MUCH
PROFIT TO DEAL WITH AND THEY
HAVE THIS EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT
OF PROFITABLE REVENUE HE HAS
CREATED.
IT IS AN AMAZING PROBLEM TO HAVE
THEM PROBABLY NO COMPANY HAS
EVER HAD BEFORE.
RAMY: TREASURY SECRETARY JACK
LEW HAS SAID THE EUROPEAN
COMMISSION IS UNFAIRLY TARGETING
U.S. COMPANIES, INCLUDING APPLE,
STARBUCKS AND FIAT CHRYSLER AND
AMAZON.
ARE U.S. COMPANIES BEING
TARGETED UNFAIRLY?
GUEST: FROM A REGULATORY POINT
OF VIEW, I WOULD SAY YES.
THERE'S NOT A REAL UNDERSTANDING
OF THE GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY AND
WHAT THE EU IS TRYING TO DO, THE
WAY THEY HANDLE PERSONAL DATA,
STORING EVERYTHING LOCALLY, IT'S
NOT REASONABLE THESE COMPANIES
TO OPERATE THE WAY THEY DO AND
STRUCTURE THEIR DATA THAT WAY.
THERE'S A VERY PAROCHIAL
NATIONAL AND REGIONAL APPROACH I
DON'T THINK REALLY SERVES ANYONE
WELL.
RAMY: DO YOU THINK THIS IS
SOMETHING EASILY WRAPPED UP? IS
THE NEXT CAP HERE?
JOHN: -- ALEX: I'M ESSENTIALLY
BIASED BECAUSE I AM A BRIT BUT
AIR IN MIND THAT EUROPE IS NOT A
SINGLE NATIONSTATE, IT IS 27
STATES AND ALAN THINK OF THOSE
IF YOU ARE THE COMMISSION OR
RELEVANT AUTHORITY IS VERY
DIFFICULT.
THE ATMOSPHERE ON THE MAINLAND
IS CLEARLY TO TAX HELL OUT OF
THEM AND BRITAIN, IT'S A BIT
MORE LACKADAISICAL.
THE BALANCE IN THOSE INTEREST IS
A PRIORITY FOR THEM AND THAT
LEADS TO THAT ON A REGULATORY
LEVEL.
RAMY: AS A BRIDGE AND AN EXPERT,
DO YOU THINK SOME OF THIS IS
BECAUSE THESE ARE AMERICAN
COMPANIES QUESTION MARK IS THERE
AN ELEMENT OF THAT KIND OF
DISCRIMINATION?
ALEX: I'M WARY OF STEPPING IN TO
STEREOTYPES BUT IF YOU ARE
FRENCH, THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE.
IF YOU ARE GERMAN OR RISH,
PERHAPS LESS THE CASE.
THERE IS A FEELING THAT IF MONEY
IS BEING EARNED IN EUROPE, IT
SHOULD BE TAXED IN EUROPE IN
ORDER TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES
EUROPE IS GOOD AT PROVIDING FOR
IT CITIZENS.
RAMY: TIM COOK AND DONALD TRUMP,
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN SILICON
VALLEY DO NOT CARE FOR DONALD
TRUMP AND TIM COOK HAS SAID HE
PROBABLY DOESN'T.
THERE IS AN OPEN LETTER FROM 100
TECH LEADERS THAT SAYS DONALD
TRUMP IS A DISASTER.
EVEN KNOW THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE
DID PROPOSE SLASHING TAXES FROM
35% TO 10%, HE'S STILL NOT
GETTING TRACTION.
WHAT MORE CAN HE DO? CAN HE DO
ANYTHING?
DAVID: A TRUMP ABOUT TECH?
I DON'T THINK EITHER CANDIDATE
TALKS ABOUT THE CATALYTIC ROLE
OF TECH IN THE ECONOMY AND I
DON'T THINK THEY SHOW A
TREMENDOUS UNDERSTANDING.
FRANKLY, HILLARY'S POLICY
PROPOSALS ARE IMPRESSIVE.
DOES SHE EVER TALK ABOUT THAT
STUFF PUBLICLY QUESTION MARK
HARDLY AT ALL.
FROM A POLICY PROPOSAL REVIEW,
TRUMP HAS ALMOST NOTHING.
I THINK HE COULD DO A LOT MORE,
BUT I DON'T EXPECT IT FROM THEM.
RAMY: WHAT DO YOU THINK HE COULD
DO, IF ANYTHING?
ALEX: AS MUCH AS ANY COMPANY
SAYS THEY WANT TO GO OUT AND
CHANGE THE WORLD, ULTIMATELY,
THEY ARE A PROFIT-MAKING
MACHINE.
IF YOU ARE BALANCING THAT
AGAINST THE APPEARANCE OF YOUR
CUSTOMER BASE, SOMEONE LIKE
APPLE IN PARTICULAR, THEY TEND
TO GO FOR THE MORE PREMIUM
CUSTOMER, THE HIGH EARNERS.
PERHAPS AS A CALCULATION
BALANCING THAT AGAINST WHO THE
POTENTIAL TRUMP DEMOGRAPHIC
MIGHT THE.
THAT SEEMS TO SUGGEST THERE'S NO
WAY THEY WOULD SACRIFICE ANY
MORAL STANDPOINT THEY HAVE ON
POLICY FOR A QUICK BUCK BECAUSE
THE DOWNSIDE SEEMS TO BE A LOT
MORE CONSIDERABLE FROM A
REPUTATION STANDPOINT.
RAMY: TIM COOK IS REPORTEDLY
HOSTING A FUNDRAISER FOR HILLARY
CLINTON ON THURSDAY NIGHT.
WHAT APPEALS ABOUT HILLARY
CLINTON TO SILICON VALLEY FOLKS?
ALEX: THIS IS WHERE WE LIKE TO
SAY THEY ARE OUT TO CHANGE THE
WORLD AND THE SENSIBILITY IN
TERMS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
AROUND THE TOWN.
THERE ARE A FEW PROMINENT
REPUBLICANS, BUT IF YOU DRIVE
AROUND SAN FRANCISCO, IT'S HARD
TO SEE A HILLARY POSTER UNTIL
RECENTLY.
IT WAS ERNIE SUPPORTERS
THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND THAT
SPEAKS TO THE NATURE OF THE
POLITICAL LANDSCAPE.
RAMY: IN THAT PIECE, OUR
COLLEAGUE TALKS ABOUT THAT APPLE
NEEDS TO HAVE A NEW PRODUCT.
UNDER THE WATCH OF TIM COOK, THE
ONLY THING THAT HAS COME OUT IS
THE WATCH.
ARE THEY LEVELING OUT WITH SOME
KIND OF INNOVATION CURVE?
DAVID: THEY SUPPOSEDLY HAVE A
CAR -- THEY ARE A VERY SECRETIVE
COMPANY.
THE WATCH WAS CLEARLY NOT A HOME
RUN.
IT IS HARD TO FAULT TIM COOK
GIVEN THE EXTRA GRAYSCALE OF
GROWTH HE HAS DONE AS AN
EXECUTION ALL LEADER, KEEPING
THE IPHONE BUSINESS GROWING.
HAVE THEY INNOVATED IN ANY
FUNDAMENTAL WAY?
NO.
I LOOK AT THEM IN COMPARISON TO
AMAZON AND THEY HAVE COME OUT
WITH A CATALYTIC, NEW DEVICE --
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF APPLE
WOULD HAVE COME OUT WITH
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BUT THEY
DIDN'T.
RAMY: WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
SPEAKING OF APPLE, CHECK OUT
THESE STOCKS WE ARE WATCHING --

IT'S NOT ENTIRELY NEW.
FIDELITY OWNED SHARES OF

IN 2012, BUT IT'S BECOMING MORE
COMMON RECENTLY AS MORE STARTUPS
ACHIEVE TOWERING VALUATIONS.
ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF
SNAPCHAT, DROPBOX OR AIRBNB,
MORE THAN $10 BILLION.
MY COLLEAGUE IS STANDING BY WITH
OUR GUEST, THE SOARING CAPITAL
MANAGING DIRECTOR WHO, AFTER 14
YEARS IS EXPANDING THE GROWTH
HOLDINGS IN THE TECH SPACE AND
THE RED ROCK CAPITAL COFOUNDER.
TAKE IT AWAY.
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SPACE
OF INVESTING IN INVESTOR
CAPITAL.
IT CHANGING TO MEDICALLY AND WE
SEE A LOT OF NEW ENTRIES
INCLUDING PLACES LIKE YOURS.
THERE'S SO MUCH MONEY AND EVEN
KNOW THERE HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT
OF A DOWNTURN, WHAT MAKES YOU SO
CONVINCED WE NEED NON-
CONVENTIONAL PLAYERS IN HERE
WHEN THERE IS ALREADY SO MUCH?
GUEST: YOU HAVE COMPANIES
RAISING A LOT MORE MONEY, 40
MILLION, $50 MILLION, AND YOU
HAVE A CONVERGENCE OF
EARLY-STAGE INVESTOR INC..
YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME OF THE
OTHER ASPECTS FOR THE COMPANY
AND I THINK COMING AT IT FROM A
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT ANGLES IS
IMPORTANT OR IT TO MATURE INTO A
BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY.
>> WE HEAR ABOUT HOW SILICON
VALLEY IS SO RELATIONSHIP DRIVEN
AND IT'S ALL ABOUT WHO YOU KNOW
AND HOW SILICON VALLEY COMPANY
CAN SAY TO AN ENTREPRENEUR THAT
WE CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO
INVESTORS.
WE CAN BRING YOU THE COO AND WE
HAVE THE EXPERTISE.
DO INVESTORS HAVE IN-HOUSE
EXPERTISE THAT IS NEEDED?
GUEST: I THINK SOME ARE WORKING
TOWARD IT.
I'M A LITTLE SKEPTICAL WHEN I
SEE MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES
WRITING BIG CHECKS BECAUSE IS IT
THE LORE OF THE RETURN OR HAVE
THEY DONE NOT ONLY THE VALUATION
WORK, WHICH IS THE EASY PART,
BUT THE ANALYSIS?
WE RECENTLY HAD A CLIENT ASK US
NOT TO INVEST ANY MONEY
SPECIFICALLY IN PRIVATE
COMPANIES BECAUSE IT COMES WITH
THE ONGOING VALUATION THIS AND
IT DEPENDS ON THE STRUCTURE.
MAYBE IF THEY PUT IN ON A
COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT TRUST, IT
MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE IF WE
HAVE A DOWNTURN AND PEOPLE ARE
KNOCKING ON THE DOOR FOR
LIQUIDITY.
>> WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE
COMING IN REEVALUATING HOW THEY
USE TART UPS AND WE HAVE SEEN
VALUATIONS DUMBING DOWN.
WHERE DO YOU STAND ON THAT?
HOW OUT OF WHACK HAVE THINGS
GOTTEN AND HOW COMFORTABLE ARE
YOU VALUATIONS ARE WHERE THEY
SHOULD BE RIGHT NOW?
GUEST: YOU HAD A LOT OF
NONTRADITIONAL MONEY COME INTO
THE MARKET AND USUALLY WHEN THAT
COMES IN, VALUATION GOES UP.
THERE ARE OTHER DEALS THAT
SHOULD NOT BE FUNDED THAT ARE.
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR,
THAT HEALED BACK AND VALUATIONS
BECAME A LITTLE MORE REALISTIC.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF
FUNDS RAISED, IT WAS A BUMPER
YEAR WHICH TO ME SAYS THIS IS AN
INVESTOR LED DOWNTURN AND I
DON'T THINK INVESTORS ARE
DISAPPOINTED FOR TOO LONG.
GUEST: I THINK WHEN WE TAKE A
STEP BACK AND YOU LOOK AT MY
THAT EQUITY, FOCUSING THEIR
MONEY RIGHT NOW, YOU SEE IT
THROUGH A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
LENS.
WE SEE IT AS THE LOWER TURN
ENVIRONMENT HAS LEFT INVESTOR
LANDS THAT HAVE NOT LOWERED
RETURN RATES TO SOME DEGREE
CHASING THE RETURN AND THAT
SOMETIMES DOES NOT END WELL,
SAME THING FOR THE SOVEREIGN
WEALTH FUND.
>> WE HAVE HEARD FROM REGULARS
AND WASHINGTON THAT THEY HAVE
WESTON'S ABOUT NONTRADITIONAL
INVESTORS.
IS THERE ENOUGH -- ENOUGH
EXPOSURE WHICH BY NATURE ARE
VERY CLOSE TO MAY WANT TO GROW
AND DO NOT WANT THE SCRUTINY
FROM OUTSIDE.
IF YOU ARE BRINGING IN A MUTUAL
FUND, SHOULD THERE BE A MID-TIER
OF REGULATION OR WE NEED CERTAIN
DISCLOSURES WE ARE NOT GETTING
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY
NONTRADITIONAL INVESTORS?
GUEST: I THINK THE QUESTION IS
WHETHER MUTUAL FUND HOLDERS
SHOULD BE INVEST RING IN THAT
MARKET.
WITH THE QUESTION OF REGULATION,
IT CAN HAMPER GROWTH AND DO YOU
WANT THAT IMPLICATION?
>> YOU TALK ABOUT GROWTH STAGE A
LOT.
TALK ABOUT HOW IT'S
DISTINGUISHED ME EARLIER STAGES
AND LATER STAGES AND WHY IS THAT
IMPORTANT?
>> WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DATA
WHEN IT COMES TO CUSTOMERS AND
REVENUE PROFITS.
YOU HAVE AN IDEA AND A PRODUCT
YOU ARE TRYING TO CHASE AFTER
AND IT IS REALLY THE NUMBERS.
YOU ARE LOOKING AT PROFITABILITY
MARGIN RATIOS AND I THINK YOU DO
HAVE COMPANIES THAT HAVE A BIT
OF A PROVEN TRACK RECORD, BUT IT
IS STILL VERY PEOPLE ORIENTED.
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THREE
PARTS, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE
IT TO THE NEXT JOB.
I THINK IT IS AN AREA WHERE YOU
DON'T WANT TO REPURPOSE TALENT
IN AREAS THAT ARE ONLY LOOKING
AT NUMBERS.
I THINK YOU CAN MAKE A LOT OF
MISTAKES THERE.
>> YOU HAVE THEN A PIONEER IN
ENLISTING PRIVATE EQUITY.
TELL US HOW YOUR RISK APPETITE
IS DISTINCT FROM OTHER TYPES OF
INVESTORS.
>> WE GOT INADVERTENTLY CAUGHT
UP IN THIS ALTERNATIVE
INVESTMENT CRAZE AND PRIVATE
EQUITY IS AN ASSET CLASS.
WE ARE INVESTING IN TERMS THAT
ARE FEEDER FUNDS TO TOP FIRMS
TRYING TO GIVE THE INVESTOR THAT
BUFFER AND I THINK THE SEC
SHOULD BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT
PROPER DISCLOSURE AND THESE
COMPANIES ARE PUBLIC SO THEY
HAVE TO MEET THAT DISCLOSURE
HURDLE WHICH HELPS PROTECT THE
INVESTOR.
I THINK IF YOU ARE PRIVATE, YOU
NEED TO TELL SOMEONE THAT
SOMETHING MATERIAL IS UP BECAUSE
THAT IMPACTS TRADITIONAL LPS.
WE HAVE TRIED TO CREATE A
PRODUCT THAT HAS THAT
TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE THEY ARE
GOVERNED BY TRADITIONAL
REGULATORY BODIES IN THE U.S.
AND OUTSIDE THE U.S. 
>> LOOKING AT THE IPO MARKET
WHICH HAS HAD SOME ROUGH PATCHES
THIS YEAR, WE'VE SEEN A LITTLE
ACTION THIS YEAR.
WHAT IS YOUR OUTLOOK AS WE HEAD
INTO THE END OF THE YEAR AND FOR
BOTH OF YOU, WHAT DO YOU SEE AS
THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN IPO'S AND
LIKE THE BIG PUBLICLY TRADING --
TRADED COMPANY COMING IN AND
CLEANING UP SOME OF THESE
STARTUPS THAT THEY'VE JUST GOT
SO MUCH CASH AND THEY ARE
WORRIED ABOUT THIS GUY COMING IN
EATING THEIR LUNCH?
GUEST: WE ARE LESS CONCERNED
ABOUT WHETHER THEY ARE GOING TO
GO PUBLIC OR BE ACQUIRED.
WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THEY ARE
GOING TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER A
QUALITY PRODUCT AND MAKE QUALITY
EARNINGS OFF OF THAT.
WHETHER WE ARE ACQUIRED AGO
PUBLIC IS A SECONDARY THOUGHT
BUT I THINK THE MARKET IS
OPENING AND THE TECH IPOS HAVE
REALLY PERFORMED WELL IN THE
MARKET.
>> IN THE LAST COUPLE OF SECONDS
BEFORE WE GO TO COMMERCIAL?
>> WE WOULD PREFER TO SEE
STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, BUT AS A
GENERAL RULE, EARNINGS ARE NOT
GROWING AFTER SHARE BUYBACKS ARE
ABATED.
YOU HAVE TO ASK WHAT IS THEIR
REAL MOTIVE?
ARE THEY BUYING REVENUES OR A
STRATEGIC IT FOR THEIR BUSINESS?

THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
COMING FROM SEVERAL YEARS AT IN

TALKING ABOUT LONG-TERM
INVESTING IN VENTURE CAPITAL.
ONE COULD ARGUE COMPANIES AND
THEIR GROWING VENTURE CAPITAL
FUNDS ARE SOMEWHAT OF A
NONTRADITIONAL PLAYER HERE.
TELL ME WHAT KIND OF EXPERTISE
YOU BRING FROM INTEL CAPITAL AND
HOW YOU SEE THAT CHANGING AND
MORE COMPANIES FEELING LIKE THEY
NEED TO HAVE A VENTURE CAPITAL
FIRM.
GUEST: I THINK IF THEY WANT TO
GO INTO THE VENTURE SPACE, YOU
NEED TO HAVE THAT TALENT.
IT IS DIFFERENT ASSET CLASSES
AND EACH ONE REQUIRES A
DIFFERENT WAY TO LOOK AT THE
COMPANY AND EVALUATE WHETHER
THAT IS A QUALITY ONE OR NOT.
WHAT SORENSON DECIDED TO DO WAS
BRING THEM INTO THE ENVIRONMENT
AS OPPOSED TO REPURPOSE THING
TALENT.
I THINK YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH
DIFFERENT GROWTH CURVE FOR
LEARNING CURVE AND THAT CAN LEAD
TO MISTAKES.
TOM: WHAT KIND OF IMPACT DO YOU
SEE THEM HAVING ON THE TESTING
ENVIRONMENT?
GUEST: IF THEY HAVE A DEDICATED
GROUP WITH EXPERTISE IN THE AREA
THEY ARE PURSUING BIOTECHNOLOGY
OR MEDICAL DEVICES, THAT MAKES
GOOD SENSE.
TIMES WHERE CAPITAL IS CHEAP,
KEY TO WHAT THEIR SHAREHOLDERS
WANT TO SEE, IT MAY BE AN
ENJOYABLE ADVENTURE.
TOM: YOU HAVE A LOT OF CASH
SITTING IN THESE LOCATIONS AND
GROWING PRESSURE FROM INVESTORS
TO FIND A WAY TO PUT IT TO WORK.
TO WHAT EXTENT ARE WE SEEING
THIS KIND OF INVESTMENT AS A
RESPONSE TO INVESTOR PRESSURE?
GUEST: HE SAW THIS IN THE 90'S
AND AS GOT CLOSE TO 2006 AND TO
THE SEVENTH OF THEY PUT THEIR
CAPITAL INTO VENTURE DEALS.
THE BY HIGH AND SELL LOW
STRATEGY, IT'S NOT WORTH IT.
TOM: GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT
RIGHT NOW IS HOT HEADING INTO
THE END OF THE YEAR.
HOW DO YOU SEE THAT CHANGING?
>> I'M NOT SURE I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT IS HOT.
REAL ASSETS INCLUDING STARTUPS,
I WILL SAY STABLE CASH FLOW IS
GETTING A PREMIUM.
PEOPLE ARE UNDERSTANDING
VALUATION MAY BE STRETCHED AND
COULD THEY STRETCHED FOR A
WHILE, BUT IF PEOPLE CAN SHOW
THEY HAVE CLASS -- HAVE CASH
FLOW BUSINESS MODELS, THEIR CASH
FLOWS THEY STABLE, THOSE ARE

ACTIVIST YOURSELF?
WE SEE THE VENTURE CAPITALISTS
HAVING TO ADVISE AND ALL KINDS
OF AREAS WHERE MAYBE THEY
HAVEN'T HAD TO AS COMPANIES STAY
PRIVATE LONGER.
HOW MUCH DO YOU SEE YOUR SELF
INSERTING YOURSELF INTO
MANAGEMENT?
GUEST: BEING A PART OF HIS MORE
THE CORRECT WAY TO PUT IT.
WHEN WE ARE IN THE BOAT AND
ROWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION, I
HAVE FULL MY WEIGHT AS WELL.
AS THE BUSINESS BECOMES MORE
COMPLICATED AND AN ENTREPRENEUR
IS DOING IT, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE
PEOPLE WHO CAN AUGMENT THE
COMPANY.
TOM: ARE THERE AREAS YOU ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT HEADING INTO
NEXT YEAR?
REMIND ME HOW MUCH YOU HAVE IN
EMERGING MARKETS?
GUEST: OFTENTIMES, WE HAVE A
HOLDING BASE BUT MOST ASSETS ARE
IN NORTH AMERICA.
I'M NOT SURE IF WE ARE SO
CONCERNED GEOGRAPHICALLY AS WE
ARE WITH CERTAIN SECTORS AND
SECTORS ARE STARTING TO FEEL
FROTHY IN THOSE SECTORS, BE IT
CYBER SECURITY.
TOO MUCH MONEY CHASING TOO
NARROW AND OPPORTUNITY, MUCH
LIKE STORAGE THAT WILL BECOME
COMMODITIZED UNLESS YOU HAVE THE
EXPERTISE TO PICK THE LEADER FOR
UP TOM: HOW MUCH OF A WILDCARD
IS THE ELECTION IN NOVEMBER?
HOW MUCH DO YOU SEE THAT
BRINGING CAUTION TO THE MARKET?
GUEST: I THINK WHEN YOU ARE
INVESTING AT THE STAGE THAT WE
DO THE EXODUS FOUR OR FIVE OR
SIX YEARS OUTCOME IT'S LESS OF
AN ISSUE.
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT A COMPANY
THAT CAN WEATHER MULTIPLE
STORMS.
GUEST: I THINK PEOPLE ARE
GENERALLY IGNORING IT.
THEY ARE TIRED OF THE LAW AND
GOOD INVESTORS LOOK PAST THINGS,
PARTICULARLY IN PRIVATE EQUITY
AND INJURE CAPITAL, THEY KEEP
THEIR HEAD DOWN.
