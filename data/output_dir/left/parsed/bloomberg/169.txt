 STOCKS CLOSING LOWER,
SLIPPING FROM ALL-TIME HIGHS.
JOE: "WHAT'D YOU MISS?"
SCARLET: THE TAKE ON THE
ELECTION, FISCAL STIMULUS, AND
THE FED'S NEXT MOVE.
JOE: GEORGE MAGNUS WAYS IN ON
THE ECONOMY AND TRADE AFTER THE
BREXIT VOTE.
>> A LIVE UPDATE FROM WASHINGTON
, GOING DARK IN COLORADO AND
PENNSYLVANIA.
SCARLET: WE BEGIN WITH MARKET
MINUTES.
STOCKS RETREATING FROM RECORD
HIGHS.
HOUSING STARTS BEAT ESTIMATES,
CPI SOFTER THAN EXPECTED, BUT IT
IS THE COMMENTARY FROM FED
OFFICIALS THAT MAY HAVE CHANGED
THE TONE IN THE MARKET.
JOE: SOME OF THOSE SAFETY YIELD
PLACE LEADING THE WAY DOWN
TODAY.
OLIVER: I'M GOING TO START WITH
THAT.
THAT IS A CLEAR STORY TO EMERGE,
LOSSES IN UTILITIES AND
TELECOMMUNICATIONS STOCKS.
DOWN OVER 1%, TO GROUPS THAT HAD
SUPPORTED THE MARKET FOR SO
LONG.
EVEN WHEN THE EXPECTATION FOR
RATE HIKES ARE NOT CHANGING TOO
MUCH, WE SAW A BUMP UP IN NEXT

LOOK AT THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR,
DOWN TODAY, ONLY FOR STOCKS IN

2%.
OIL VERSUS THE ENERGY STOCK
INDEX, A BIT OF DIVERSIONS.

ENERGY STOCKS, PRETTY FLAT
DESPITE THE GAINS.
JOE: ON THE GOVERNMENT BOND
MARKET FRONT, THE SPREAD TO
BETWEEN THE TWO-YEAR AND THE 10

SOME INTERESTING STUFF WITH THAT
SLIGHTLY WEAKER CPI PRINT,
CAUSING SOME FLATTENING, THEN

FIZZLING.
WE HAVE SEEN A BIG RALLY AND
OIL LATELY.
NEARLY 2% TODAY.
THAT CHART EXPLAINS A LOT.
SCARLET: THOSE ARE TODAY'S
MARKET MINUTES.
JOE: PAUL KRUGMAN JOINS US NOW.
I WANT TO READ A QUOTE AND GET
RIGHT INTO THE BIGGEST STORY IN
THE WORLD, THE ELECTION, WHAT IT
MEANS FOR THE ECONOMY, DONALD
TRUMP WAS RECENTLY QUOTED IN AN
ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORK TIMES.
WE HAVE THE QUOTE HERE.
IF WE CAN BRING IT UP, THIS IS
IT.
HE WAS BASICALLY SAYING WE NEED
TO SPEND MORE.
IT IS CALLED PRIMING THE POP.
TO SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO DO THAT
A LITTLE BIT TO GET THINGS
GOING.
WE HAVE NO CHOICE -- OTHERWISE,
WE ARE GOING TO DIE ON THE VINE.
>> ON THIS, HE IS RIGHT.
IT IS PRETTY MUCH BY ACCIDENT.
IT IS TRUE.
I THINK I UNDERSTAND.
MY STRONG GUESS IS THAT
HILLARY'S ECONOMIC ADVISERS
WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE MORE
DEFICIT SPENDING, BUT THEY
FIGURE IT IS PROBABLY NOT A GOOD
THING TO SAY BECAUSE THE PUBLIC
DOES NOT LIKE THAT, AND SO SHE
IS BEING CAUTIOUS.
MINIMAL INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING,
WE NEED MORE.
>> HOW DO YOU COME TO THIS
CONCLUSION THAT HE CAME TO THIS
WITHOUT THE RIGHT REASONS?
>> ON ECONOMICS, HE HATES CHINA
AND TRADE.
EVERYTHING ELSE, HE IS FOR TAX
CUTS FOR THE RICH, INCREASES FOR
THE RICH, HE IS ON ALL SIDES OF
IT.
THIS WEEK, HE IS SAYING THAT'S
WHAT HE WANTS TO DO, BUT THERE
IS NO ACTUAL PLAN.
SCARLET: WHAT DOES HIS HISTORY
OF BORROWING AND SPENDING TO
BUILD HIS EMPIRE TELL YOU ABOUT
HOW HE WOULD APPROACH THE
NATIONAL ECONOMY?
>> WE HAVE THIS ILLUSION THAT
BUSINESS EXPERIENCE HAS A LOT TO
DO WITH RUNNING ECONOMIC POLICY,
BUT THEY ARE BOTH DIFFERENT
DOMAINS.
IT DOESN'T TELL US MUCH ABOUT
WHAT HE WOULD DO.
AND PARTICULAR, THE TRUMP STYLE,
BAR A LOT OF MONEY, THEN WALK
AWAY FROM IT.
THAT ISN'T GOING TO WORK FOR THE
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, SO NOT
USEFUL.
JOE: REGARDLESS OF WHETHER HE
STUMBLED INTO THIS BY ACCIDENT,
HIS ECONOMIC VIEWPOINT DOES NOT
SEEM TO BE IN LINE WITH THE
CLASSIC AM CONSERVATIVE,
REPUBLICAN VIEWS WE HAVE HEARD
LATELY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE REASON IS
THAT YOU HAVE CONSERVATIVE
VOICES GETTING BEHIND HIM.
>> THE USUAL SUSPECTS.
THE SAME OLD GANG.
THEY ARE MAKING A JUDGMENT THAT
WHAT HE WOULD ACTUALLY DO ARE
THE ONES THEY WANT.
ALSO, THEIR THING HAS ALWAYS
BEEN LET'S BE WHERE POWER IS,
AND THEY THINK THIS IS THEIR
BEST CHANCE.
OBVIOUSLY THERE WILL BE NO ROOM
FOR THEM, NO ONE WILL BE
LISTENING TO THEM IF HILLARY
CLINTON WINS.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THEY
NEVER REALLY CARED ABOUT
DEFICITS.
EXCEPT WITH WHICH A STICK TO
BEAT PRESIDENT OBAMA.
IT IS ALL CAMPAIGN RHETORIC.
WHAT THEY DO BELIEVE IN OUR TAX
CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY, AND TRUMP
IS PROMISING THAT.
>> HAS HIS BACKGROUND, BUT HE'S
TRYING TO TARGET AMERICANS WHO
ARE LOOKING TO HIM TO BRING THEM
UP.
, CHIP THAT ECONOMIC MALAISE IN
THE U.S. IS CONTRIBUTING TO HIS
SUPPORT BASE?
-- HOW MUCH IS THAT ECONOMIC
MALAISE IN THE U.S. CONTRIBUTING
TO HIS SUPPORT BASE?
>> ECONOMIC ANXIETY IS NOT A
GOOD PREDICT OR OF WHO IS A
TRUMP SUPPORTER.
MAYBE IF THE COUNTRY WAS
LOOMING, WAGES RISING, AND
MANUFACTURING STRONG, ALL OF
THAT ANXIETY WOULD BE ON HOLD,
BUT I'M NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THAT.
THE IDEA THAT THIS IS WHAT IT IS
ABOUT.
CHINA BASHING, TRADE, ALL OF
THESE SUBTERRANEAN AND PULSES
DRIVING THE REPUBLICAN VOTE ARE
NOW COMING TO THE SURFACE.
SCARLET: LET'S TALK ABOUT
HILLARY CLINTON.
YOU HAVE WRITTEN THAT HER VISION
IS NOTABLE FOR ITS LACK OF
OUTLANDISH ASSUMPTIONS.
SHE IS NOT JUSTIFYING HER
PROPOSALS THAT THEY WOULD CAUSE
A RADICAL QUICKENING OF THE U.S.
ECONOMY.
STRENGTHENING THE SOCIAL
SECURITY SAFETY NET BY TAXING
HIGH-INCOME EARNERS.
>> IT IS CENTER-LEFT GOVERNANCE,
AN OBAMA THIRD TERM.
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE ORBIT
THINK THAT CLINTON-TYPE POLICY
WITH MORE INFRASTRUCTURE
SPENDING MIGHT HAVE A BIGGER
IMPACT ON GROWTH THAN SHE IS
WILLING TO ASSUME.
SHE IS ESSENTIALLY ASSUMING
NOTHING IN TERMS OF GROWTH
IMPACT, BUT THEY ARE NOT WILLING
TO BET THE FARM ON IT.
IT IS PARTLY A QUESTION OF
WHETHER WE WILL SEE MORE.
THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT TAX
INCREASES AT THE TOP END, FAIRLY
SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONS TO
OBAMACARE, SO IT'S NOT THAT IT
IS MINOR, BUT IT IS A
CONTINUATION OF THE SAME KIND OF
GOVERNANCE WE HAVE HAD.
JOE: IS THE TIME FOR FISCAL
STIMULUS OVER?
>> 2-3 YEARS AGO, THE U.S.
ECONOMY WAS WELL BELOW CAPACITY.
THE FED WAS NOT THAT EFFECTIVE.
QUANTITATIVE EASING IS MARGINAL
TOOL AT BEST.
NOW THE ECONOMY MIGHT BE AT FULL
EMPLOYMENT, BUT WE DON'T KNOW
THAT.
SUPPOSE THERE IS TROUBLE IN
EUROPE OR CHINA.
SUPPOSE THERE ARE MORE PROBLEMS
OUT OF HOUSING.
WE HAVE VERY LITTLE ROOM TO
MANEUVER.
THE FED CAN'T DO MUCH MORE THAN
IT IS DOING.
FISCAL POLICY WOULD BE USEFUL AS
INSURANCE, AN ADDITIONAL SORT OF
DEMAND, AND WE KNOW IT CAN'T THE
STARTED ON SHORT NOTICE.
THERE IS A PRECAUTIONARY CASE
FOR BUSINESS STIMULUS RATHER
THAN WE NEED IT RIGHT NOW.
OF COURSE, WE CAN BORROW VERY
CHEAPLY AND WE NEED
INFRASTRUCTURE.
SCARLET: I WANT TO BRING IN
SOMETHING CARL ICAHN SAID.
>> I THINK TRUMP'S POLICIES ARE
POSSIBLY THE ONLY THING THAT
WILL SAVE US FROM GOING DOWN
THIS DECLINE WE ARE IN ON
PRODUCTIVITY.
SCARLET: THE LATEST PRODUCTIVITY
NUMBERS WERE DISAPPOINTING.
WHAT DO INVESTORS, BIG BUSINESS,
POLICYMAKERS MISUNDERSTAND THE
MOST ABOUT PRODUCTIVITY?
>> I'M NOT SURE THAT INVESTORS
MISUNDERSTAND, BUT I THINK WHAT
CARL ICAHN IS PRETENDING TO
MISUNDERSTAND IS THAT THE
PRESIDENT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH
THAT.
THE PRODUCTIVITY SLOWDOWN IS A
GLOBAL PHENOMENON.
WE ARE IN A LULL AND
TECHNOLOGY.
THERE IS NOTHING A PRESIDENT CAN
DO ABOUT THAT.
>> WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO
DISCERN IF THERE IS SOME KIND OF
MARKET REACTION TO A CLINTON OR
TRUMP PRESIDENCY, AND IT'S HARD
TO FIGURE OUT AT THIS POINT.
IT SHOULD INVESTORS BE
CONCERNED?
HOW ARE PEOPLE TRADING IN MAKING
MONEY AND MARKETS THE THINKING
ABOUT IT?
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WOULD
DO.
THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE HE
WOULD STAY IN THE BOUNDS OF
ANYBODY'S NOTION OF
RESPONSIBILITY.
ONE NUCLEAR WAR CAN SPOIL YOUR
WHOLE DAY.
NEVER MIND MY INVESTMENTS, HOW
ABOUT MY LIFE?
SCARLET: STICK WITH US.
WE WILL DISCUSS MORE AFTER THE
BREAK ON WHETHER IT IS TIME FOR
CENTRAL BANKS TO CHANGE COURSE
AND MOVE AWAY FROM THEIR CURRENT
MO.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
♪
SCARLET: WE ARE HERE WITH PAUL
KRUGMAN.
WE HAVE THE FEDERAL RESERVE
THINKING ABOUT A RETHINK OF
MONETARY POLICY.
WHAT DOES THE FEDERAL RESERVE
KNOW WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT?
>> NOT MUCH.
THERE IS AN ACCUMULATION OF
EVIDENCE THAT MONETARY POLICY IS
PRETTY INEFFECTIVE.
WE CAME INTO THIS THINKING
MONETARY POLICY AT ZERO RATES
WAS INEFFECTIVE, THEN QE, THEN
NEGATIVE RATES, WHICH I HAVE TO
ADMIT I DID NOT THINK WAS
POSSIBLE, BUT IT IS NOT ACTUALLY
DOING VERY MUCH.
YOU HAVE NEGATIVE RATES IN
EUROPE AND THEY STILL CAN'T MOVE
INFLATION.
MASSIVE QE, HOW MUCH GOOD DID
THAT DO?
SO IT LOOKS AS THOUGH WE ARE
GOING BACK TO SQUARE ONE.
IT WAS THAT THE ONLY THING YOU
COULD DO TO CREDIBLY PROMISE
HIGHER INFLATION, AND ONLY BY
CHANGING, CREATING THE
IMPRESSION OF A REGIME CHANGE
EVEN AFTER RECOVERY, THAT WAS HE
ONLY WAY MONETARY POLICY WAS
GOING TO GET TRACTION, AND WE
ARE MOST OF THE WAY BACK TO THAT
VIEW RIGHT NOW.
SCARLET: WAS THE PRESIDENT OF
THE SAN FRANCISCO FED CORRECT IN
SAYING WISHES AT HIGHER
INFLATION TARGETS.
>> I HAVE BEEN FOR THAT FOR A
WHILE.
I WENT TO THE ECB RESEARCH
CONFERENCE AND SAID THAT.
THEY WERE ALL POLITE AND IGNORED
ME.
THAT'S WHERE I CAME IN AND 19 98
TALKING ABOUT JAPAN, THE SAME
THING.
JOE: WE GOT THIS NOTE FROM JOHN
WILLIAMS WHERE HE LAID OUT
POSSIBILITY FOR RETHINKING,
COMMITTED TO HIGHER INFLATION,
MORE AGGRESSIVE STABILIZERS, AND
WHEN I READ IT, I THOUGHT THIS
IS STUFF PEOPLE HAVE THEM
TALKING ABOUT FOR YEARS.
I GUESS THE REAL STORY IS THAT
IT'S COMING FROM SOMEONE SO
CENTRAL AT THE FED.
>> A LOT OF IT IS HISTORY.
THERE WAS BLOOD, SWEAT, TEARS,
AND TOYA TO GET INFLATION DOWN,
AND THE ALL SETTLED ON THIS 2%
TARGET, AND VERY HARD TO SAY
THAT MAYBE THAT WAS SET TO LOW.
THAT IS SOMETHING THEY HAVE BEEN
RELUCTANT TO RETHINK, AND EVEN
NOW.
THE NEWS THAT ANYONE AT THE FAT
IS WILLING TO ENTERTAIN THAT
NOTION -- AT THE FED IS WILLING
TO ENTERTAIN THAT NOTION -- 
>> WOULD YOU WANT TO SEE NEXT
WEEK?
>> I AM MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN
READING RESEARCH PAPERS.
IF A RADICAL RETHINK IS GOING TO
HAPPEN, IT WILL NOT HAPPEN IN
OPEN DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR.
IT WILL HAPPEN BEHIND CLOSED
DOORS.
I THINK I HAVE BEEN BLACKBALLED
FROM JACKSON HOLE SINCE I
CRITICIZE ALAN GREENSPAN YEARS
AGO.
THE VALUE IS TO HAVE THE CENTRAL
BANKERS EXPOSED TO SMART
ACADEMICS.
>> WE WILL LOOK INTO THE
BLACKLISTING.
JOE: YOU WERE IN JAPAN AND MET
PRIME MINISTER SHINZO ABE, I'M
CURIOUS WHAT YOUR PRESCRIPTION
IS FOR JAPAN, AND HAVING SEEN
THE ABENOMICS EXPERIENCE OVER
THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WITH MIXED
RESULTS, WHAT IS YOUR TAKE AWAY?
WHAT DID YOU LEARN?
>> WE ARE SEEING THE LIMITS OF
MONETARY POLICY.
ABENOMICS WAS THE SUPPOSED TO BE
FISCAL EXPANSION, UNORTHODOX
MONETARY POLICY, AND FISCAL
REFORM.
THE SECOND ERROR NEVER CAME
ALONG.
THERE HAS BEEN NOTE NET FISCAL
STIMULUS.
THERE WAS A CONSUMPTION TAX
HIKE, A BIG MISTAKE.
I WAS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO HELP
TO PERSUADE ABE NOT TO DO
ANOTHER ROUND.
I AM AN ADMIRER OF GOVERNOR
KURODA.
I THINK THE CENTRAL BANK OF
JAPAN HAS DONE WONDERS THINGS
GIVING ITS HISTORY AND
CONSTRAINTS, BUT HAS NOT HAD THE
BACKING OF AN EXPANSIONIST
MONETARY POLICY.
SCARLET: CAN THE BOJ GET DONE
WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO?
>> I THINK SO.
JAPAN NEEDS A HIGHER INFLATION
TARGET.
THEY NEED TO GO FURTHER.
SCARLET: ARE THEY AS CONSTRAINED
AS THE FED IS?
IS THE BOJ CONSTRAINED IN THE
SAME WAY?
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
SHINZO ABE CAN DO STUFF IN A WAY
THAT THE U.S. PRESIDENT CANNOT.
THEY HAVE DECADES OF STAGNATION.
THEY HAVE BECOME THE MOST
ADVENTUROUS POLICYMAKERS IN THE
ADVANCED WORLD.

JOE:JOE: I AM HERE WITH PAUL

I WANT YOUR TAKE, A LOT OF
DEBATE LATELY ON THE STATE OF
MACRO ECONOMICS.
YOU HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT IT.
PEOPLE COMPLAIN THE MAINSTREAM
HAS GONE OFF IN A BAD DIRECTION.
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON IT?
>> 1970'S, A STRONG CRITIQUE OF
KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS, STAGFLATION
WAS A BIG SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM,
AND IN RESPONSE, EVERYBODY MOVED
OFF TOWARDS MODELS WHERE PEOPLE
WERE RATIONAL, RUSSIAN
EXPECTATIONS, LIMITED ROLE FOR
GOVERNMENT POLICY, AND A BIG
MATHING UP.
IT HAS TURNED OUT THAT ALL OF
THOSE MODELS HAVE BEHAVED BADLY
SINCE 2007.
THEY HAVE NOT HANDLED THE EVENTS
WELL.
IN SOME WAYS, OLD-FASHIONED WAYS
HAVE WORKED BETTER.
JOE: YOU HEAR TALK ABOUT
MAINSTREAM, THE MMT SCHOOL,
WHERE YOU FALL ON THIS DEBATE?
>> NEITHER.
I AM IN THE -- MACRO AS WE DID
IT FROM 1936-1970 TURNS OUT TO
HAVE A LOT OF INSIGHT TO THE
CURRENT SITUATION.
THERE ARE PLACES WHERE I AGREE
WITH THEM, BUT I DON'T NEED

I DO BELIEVE IN STAYING HONEST

I DON'T THINK IT WAS
DELIBERATELY DECEPTIVE.
I JUST DON'T THINK IT WAS

A YEAR LATER, IS CHINA'S
MONETARY POLICY AND CURRENCY
POLICY ON A MORE SOUND FOOTING?
>> IT IS ON AN EVEN KEEL
COMPARED WITH THIS TIME LAST
YEAR.
AT THE TURN OF THE YEAR, WE HAD
ANOTHER PERIOD OF PANIC FOR MUCH
THE SAME REASON IN DECEMBER AND
JANUARY.
THE PBOC INTRODUCED A BASKET,
TRYING TO MANAGE THE THE
CURRENCY, AND DECEMBER, CAPITAL
CONTROLS OF BEEN TIGHTENED, THE
ECONOMY IS LOOKING MORE STABLE
THANKS TO ROBUST STIMULUS
PROGRAM INTRODUCED, SO FOR THE
TIME BEING, THINGS CERTAINLY
LOOK MUCH MORE CALM.
MATT: ARE YOU OF THE OPINION
THAT WE SHOULD BE PAYING CLOSER
ATTENTION TO THE SIGNALING OF
THE UNDERLYING CHINESE ECONOMY
OR ARE THINGS THAT STRONG THAT
WE CAN MOVE ON AND MOVE PAST THE
DEPRECIATION?
>> MY FEELING IS THAT IF GLOBAL
MARKETS WERE GUILTY OF
OVERREACTING IN AUGUST LAST YEAR
AND JANUARY THIS YEAR, THEN I
THINK AT THE MOMENT THAT THEY
ARE BEING A LITTLE COMPLACENT.
MAYBE MARKETS HAVE HAD JUST TOO
MANY THINGS TO THINK ABOUT, FED
POLICY, BREXIT.
THE REASONS THAT THINGS HAVE
CALMED IN THE CHINESE MARKET
IS BECAUSE OF AN EXTERNAL GROWTH
IN CREDIT AND A BIG FISCAL BOOST
WITH THE SHARE OF GOVERNMENT
SPENDING RISING THREE PERCENTAGE
POINTS OF GDP AND LAST 18
MONTHS.
A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING
, COMPENSATING FOR THE DECLINE
IN PRIVATE INVESTMENT FOR THE
FIRST TIME SINCE RECORDS BEGAN,
SO THE PROBLEM IS THAT THESE
THINGS WON'T BE ABLE TO
CONTINUE.
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WON'T BE
ABLE TO SUSTAIN THESE THINGS.
THERE ARE SOME GREAT DISSENSIONS
GOING ON WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT
AS TO WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE
PURSUING THESE POLICIES IN THE
FIRST PLACE, SO MY HUNCH IS THAT
THINGS WILL START TO SLOW DOWN
DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE
YEAR IN THE ECONOMY, AND THE
RENMINBI WILL WEAKEN AGAIN.
SCARLET: WHAT IS THE COST OF
CHINA MAINTAINING STABILITY AT
ALL COSTS?
>> THE COST IS THAT IN THE SHORT
RUN, WHICH IS TO SAY FOR THE
FORESEEABLE FUTURE, WE HAVE
EXACTLY THIS KIND OF SITUATION
WHERE NOBODY REALLY PAYS A HUGE
AMOUNT OF ATTENTION TO WHAT IS
GOING ON, BUT AS MOST ECONOMISTS
WOULD PROBABLY RECOGNIZE OR
CONCEDE, AND THE LONGER THE
CURRENCY AND POLICY STANCE
CONTINUES WITH CREDIT GROWING TO
TIMES OR THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT
OF NOMINAL GDP AND WITH FISCAL
STIMULUS AS WELL, THE BIGGER THE
BURDEN OF ADJUSTMENT AND THEIR
RISK OF A FINANCIAL INSTABILITY
IS GOING TO BE, PERHAPS AT A
TIME WHEN THE CHINESE WOULD NOT
CHOOSE IT, AND THE YEAR WILL BE
REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AT THE
END OF 2017, THE 19TH CONGRESS,
WHEN THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO PUT
IT BEFORE HIS PEOPLE.
THE LONGER YOU DON'T ROCK THE
BOAT, THE ROUGHER IT IS LIKELY
TO BECOME.
THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE SEEN
AND OUR OWN EXPERIENCE, AND
CHINA IS LOOKING TO BE HEADED IN
THE SAME WAY.
JOE: SOMETHING YOU SAID ABOUT
THE NARRATIVE ON CHINA STABILITY
GETTING STALE, THE CITY'S
ECONOMICS SURPRISE INDEX FOR
CHINA TOOK A SHARP LEG DOWN
AFTER MEDIOCRE RETAIL SALES,
FIXED ASSETS, SO WE ARE ALREADY
SEEING THE INABILITY FOR CHINA
TO HOLD UP THAT CREDIT AND
FISCAL DRIVEN STABILITY THAT WAS
A STORY FOR THE FIRST HALF OF
THE YEAR?
>> YES, THAT IS RIGHT.
THE SECONDARY STORY AWAY FROM
THE HEADLINES IS THAT THE MORE
THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO SEVCON
-- SIR, CENTCOM
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO NEXT
TIME?
WILL THEY INCREASE FISCAL
SPENDING FURTHER, CUT INTEREST
RATES AT A TIME WHEN THE ECONOMY
DOES NOT NEED IT?
ARE THEY GOING TO ALLOW CREDIT
TO GROW?
THESE ARE ISSUES WHICH WERE
RAISED BY A SO-CALLED AUTHORITY
OF SOURCE THAT EVERYBODY
UNDERSTANDS AS CLOSE TO THE
PRESIDENT IN MAY, AND NOTHING
HAS HAPPENED.
THIS IS THE ISSUE REALLY.
IT IS JUST NOT SUSTAINABLE, AND
THE LONGER THE GOVERNMENT TRIES
TO STICK TO THIS OLD MODEL OF
KEEPING THE ECONOMY GOING AT ANY
COSTS, SUBSCRIBING TO THE 6.5%
TO 7% GDP TARGET, THE MORE
DAMAGING IT IS LIKELY TO BECOME.
IF WE COULD ONLY PREDICT WITH
CERTAINTY THAT IT HAS A LIFESPAN
OF THREE MONTH'S OR FOUR MONTHS,
THAT WOULD BE SO MUCH EASIER AS
AN INVESTOR, BUT YOU CAN'T DO
THAT.

MORE PROTRACTED AND COMPLEX.

BRIEFLY BEFORE THE REFERENDUM,
POLITICIANS SAYING THAT IF THE

NOTION OF OUR INTENTION TO QUIT

DECISION, AND THAT DIDN'T
HAPPEN.
IN JULY, PEOPLE WERE TALKING

NOW WE ARE SEEING ALL SORTS OF

GOVERNMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND,
THE GERMANS AND FRENCH HAVE

LITTLE BIT MORE NOW.
ARGUABLY THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE

LINEUP OF DATA IN THE U.K.,
UNEMPLOYMENT, RETAIL, AND
LARGELY THE MARKET IS LOOKING AT
THESE NUMBERS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
IS GOING TO GO WRONG AND HOW BAD
BREXIT WILL BE, BUT WHEN YOU SEE
RISK ASSETS DOING WELL, IS THERE
A CHANCE HERE THAT PERHAPS THERE
WILL BE A CERTAIN POINT THAT WE
CAN SAY THE DATA IS NOT CROPPING
UP YET AND MAY BE THE FALLOUT IS
NOT AS BAD AS WE EXPECTED?
>> THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION, AND
IT HAS AN A AND B ANSWER.
A, THE VOTE AFFECTS THE
POTENTIAL LEVEL OF DEMAND IN THE
ECONOMY.
WE HAVE NOT HAD ANYTHING OTHER
THAN ANECDOTE ABOUT WHAT IS
GOING ON IN THE REAL ECONOMY,
AND IT IS ONLY A MONTHS WORTH OF
DATA, SO WE WON'T GET A REAL
FEEL FOR THIS UNTIL OCTOBER.
THE DOE CONCERN IN THE
GOVERNMENT'S CONCERN HERE IS
THAT WE COULD GET TIPPED INTO A
RECESSION IF INVESTMENT SPENDING
AND EMPLOYMENT HIRES, IF THESE
THINGS DRY UP, THEN WE WILL GO
OVER THE EDGE.
THAT IS A POSSIBILITY.
IT IS BY NO MEANS A SHOE IN.
I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH THIS OR
SAY THAT IT IS NOT IMPORTANT,
BUT IF WE DID HAVE A RECESSION,
IT WOULD NOT BE A 2008-2009 KIND
OF DOWNTURN, BECAUSE THE BANKING
SYSTEM IS FUNDAMENTALLY OK, SO
WE WERE NOT HAVE CREDIT
RECESSION, THAT KIND OF
DOWNTURN, AND WE WOULD RECOVER
FROM A BUSINESS DOWNTURN WITHIN
A REASONABLE TIME.
THE B IN MY VIEW IS MUCH MORE
IMPORTANT, THE ECONOMY'S
POTENTIAL TO GROW OVER THE NEXT
5-10 YEARS.
IF WE SCREW UP AND MAKE A MESS
OF TRADE AND INVESTMENT, BOTH
BRITISH COMPANIES AND FOREIGN
COMPANIES THAT WANT TO SET UP IN
THE U.K., IF WE RESTRICT THE
IMPORTED SKILLED LABOR, THESE
ARE THE THINGS THAT WILL REALLY
IMPACT THE BRITISH ECONOMY'S
ABILITY TO GROW SATISFACTORILY,
AND THAT WOULD BE MUCH MORE
DANGEROUS THAN SIX MONTHS OF A
RECESSION.

NON-TARIFF BARRIERS THAT IS
GATHERING MOMENTUM THROUGHOUT
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.
MOST OF THE PERPETRATORS ARE
G-20 ECONOMIES THAT WE WANT TO
DO OUR TRADING WITH.
THE THIRD THING IS THAT THE
BRITISH ECONOMY DEPENDS A LOT ON
SERVICES EXPORTS.
WE SELL MOST OF OUR SERVICES TO
THE EU, THE UNITED STATES, AND
JAPAN.
WE WILL NOT BE SELLING A LOT OF
SERVICES TO THE CHINESE COME THE
INDIANS, AND EMERGING COUNTRIES.
IF THESE NONTARIFF BARRIERS COME
INTO EFFECT, THEY WILL BE A BIG
PRICE TO PAY.
JOE: GEORGE MAGNUS, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
SCARLET: COMING UP, A NEW POLL
SHOWS DONALD TRUMP TRAILING
HILLARY CLINTON BY WIDE MARGINS
IN VIRGINIA AND FLORIDA.
IS IT TOO LATE FOR DONALD TRUMP
TO TURN IT ALL AROUND?
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.
♪
OLIVER: HILLARY CLINTON IS
EXPANDING HER LEAD INTO HE
BATTLED GROUND STATES.
A WASHINGTON POST POLL SHOWS
CLINTON WITH A 14 POINT LEAD
OVER TRUMP AND VIRGINIA.
A NEW POLL HAS THE DEMOCRAT UP
BY NINE POINTS IN FLORIDA.
LET'S FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING
ON.
WELCOME.
WHAT GIVES ON THE LATEST POLL?
ANYTHING HAPPENED BETWEEN LAST
TIME AND NOW?
>> IT IS GETTING WORSE FOR
TRUMP.
VIRGINIA IS STARTING TO LOOK OUT
OF REACH.
I THINK HIS CAMPAIGN IS MORE
WORRIED ABOUT THE POLLS IN
FLORIDA.
OLIVER: TRUMP THROUGH THE
PRIMARIES WAS ALL ABOUT THE
POLLING, BUT NOW HE'S NOT
TALKING ABOUT IT SO MUCH.
IS HE GIVING ANY COMMENTARY ON
THE LATEST NUMBERS?
>> HE SEEMS LIKE HE IS
RECONCILING HIMSELF TO THE IDEA
THAT HE MIGHT JUST LOSE.
HE HAS MENTIONED A COUPLE OF
TIMES THAT IF HE LOSES, HE WILL
TAKE A LONG VACATION.
IT'S INTERESTING THAT SOME OF
HIS SUPPORTERS ARE DISMISSING A
LOT OF THESE POLLS AND INSISTING
THAT RALLY ATTENDANCE IS A
BETTER MEASURE OF SUPPORT FOR
THE CANDIDATE THAN POLLING, EVEN
THOUGH THE POLLING WAS QUITE
ACCURATE DURING THE PRIMARIES
WHEN IT SAID HE WOULD WIN, AND
HE DID.
JOE: YOU SOUND A LITTLE
SKEPTICAL OF THE RALLY MEASURES.
THERE HAS BEEN TALK OF THE
PEOPLE URGING THE RNC TO CUT AND
RUN TO AVOID A DOWN BALLOT
BLOODBATH.
DO YOU SEE ANY CHANCE OF THAT
HAPPENING?
>> IT SEEMS UNLIKELY TO ME.
THAT WOULD BE A MAJOR DEPARTURE
FROM STANDARDS AND NORMS FOR THE
PARTY COMMITTEE TO ABANDON THE
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND
TIREDLY.
-- CANDIDATE ENTIRELY.
THERE WAS SOME REPORTING THAT
THE CHAIRMAN WOULD DO THAT
UNLESS HE ENDORSED PAUL RYAN,
AND THEN DONALD TRUMP CAME OUT
AND ENDORSED HIM.
I THINK HE WILL HAVE THE PARTY
SUPPORT THROUGH THE ELECTION.
SCARLET: WHAT IS NEXT FOR DONALD
TRUMP, I FOREIGN POLICY SPEECH,
AND ECONOMIC POLICY SPEECH.
HE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE PUTTING A
LOT OF STOCK INTO CAMPAIGNING IN
PLACES LIKE VIRGINIA, SO HOW
DOES HE TURN THE MOMENTUM
AROUND?
>> TONIGHT HE IS IN WISCONSIN,
ANOTHER STATE MOVING RAPIDLY OUT
OF REACH FOR HIM, SO HE'S NOT
ABANDONING THE CHANCE TO WIN IN
THESE PLACES.
I THINK THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE
UPCOMING DEBATES AS THE NEXT KEY
TURNING POINT IN THIS CAMPAIGN.
HE HAS TO WIN THE DEBATES ARE
PROBABLY HIS CAMPAIGN IS OVER.
JOE: THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE.
SCARLET: COMING UP, WHICH YOU
NEED TO KNOW TO CARE OF FOR
TOMORROW'S TRADING DAY.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

SCARLET: DON'T MISS THIS.
U.K. UNEMPLOYMENT AND AVERAGE
WEEKLY EARNINGS TOMORROW
MORNING.
OLIVER: TARGET EARNINGS TOMORROW
AT 8:00 A.M. 
JOE: I WILL BE LOOKING AT FED
MINUTES OUT TOMORROW AT 2:00
P.M..
THE ODDS OF A SEPTEMBER HIKE
LOW, THE ODDS OF A HIKE THIS
YEAR DIMINISH, BUT WE WILL GET A
SENSE OF HOW THEY SEE RISKS TO
THE ECONOMY AND THE OUTLOOK.
SCARLET: A LOT HAS CHANGED SINCE
THEN.
JOE: WE HAD STRONG DATA, RETAIL
SALES DATA, QUESTIONABLE CPI
DATA THIS MORNING, SO A LOT TO
GO THROUGH.
OLIVER: EVEN THOUGH SENTIMENT IS
NOTHING WILL HAPPEN, THE
LIKELIHOOD OF A RATE HIKE HAS
GONE UP SCARLET: A LITTLE BIT.
