- Narrator: More than 1,000 North Koreans
try to escape the country every year.
They risk being killed,
imprisoned, or trafficked,
as they escape through China, Mongolia,
and different regions of southeast Asia.
This is Yeon Mi Park.
She escaped North Korea when
she was just 13 years old,
and she described her ordeal to us.
- I think, just life was so
unbearable in North Korea.
I found this note that my
sister left, saying that,
"Go find this person, and she
will help you to go to China."
We got that note, and my mother and I
found the person, that lady.
And then she told me that
she had a few daughters,
but she sent them all to China,
and told me she could
help us to go to China.
And we did not know that she was a broker,
or anything, just we thought,
"This stranger woman wants to help us,"
and that's how we just followed her lead
and we escaped at night,
the very same day.
Initially, I escaped to China,
and I was being sold and trafficked
and enslaved for two years there.
- Narrator: Park wasn't alone.
Around 70% of North Korean
defectors are women,
and many of them are targeted to be sold
as brides or trafficked.
Defectors are considered
illegal migrant workers,
and are sent back to North Korea
to face punishment if caught.
- My mother and myself
We crossed the Gobi Desert to Mongolia.
And, from Mongolia, we
were there a few months,
and then we flew to South Korea.
I think that when I was
crossing the Gobi Desert,
in minus 40 degrees at night
in 2009, I was 15 by then.
I think wasn't scared of dying
in that desert, I just thought,
"Even this universe abandoned me."
Like, I was punished that
I was born in North Korea.
My crime was as simple as that,
that I was born on the
wrong side of the river.
- Narrator: She and her
mother finally arrived 
in South Korea two years later in 2009.
Once a North Korean defector
makes it to South Korea,
they're granted citizenship
under the South Korean Nationality Law,
which states that any person
born on the Korean Peninsula
is eligible to be a South
Korean citizen, but first,
they have to go through
a lengthy screening
and reeducation process.
Once cleared, defectors enter
the Settlement Support Center
for North Korean Refugees,
commonly called Hanawon.
- They put us into a place
called Hanawon Resettlement.
Every thinks that once you escape,
once you arrive in the land of freedom,
people think that's the end of the story,
everyone is fine and
happy, but that's not it.
- Narrator: Defectors
spend up to three months
learning the history of
the Korean Peninsula,
along with basic life skills
like how to use an ATM,
and shop for groceries.
Many defectors are drastically
behind in education,
as North Korea emphasizes propaganda
over skills like reading and math.
It can be difficult for Hanawon officials
to address the needs of the defectors,
due to the lack of
information about North Korea.
Defectors can be unprepared
for things Hanawon doesn't teach,
such as understanding South Korea's
ultra-competitive social structure.
- Do you know how South Korean kids
like working the entire night?
They have these specific tutors,
all this unbelievable
culture of education,
that they spend all their life
to go to these universities,
and study English or that,
that you can not ever catch up with them.
- Narrator: Additionally, social disparity
and political tensions
can lead to defectors
facing discrimination from South Koreans.
- I'm not welcome.
I am a second-class citizen here.
So, that was really tiring in South Korea,
because people never said
any positive things about me,
coming from North Korea
and being a defector,
because that was a stigma,
that people just are so hard on you,
even criticize, and traumatize us
for what we've gone through
or where we are from.
That's how hard it was as a defector,
and really, really, sadly,
there has been some people, actually,
who even went back to North
Korea from South Korea.
At some point, it was so
overwhelming that I was thinking,
"Just give me enough frozen potatoes"
"I'm just gonna go back to North Korea."
- Narrator: Defectors can
face a life of medical issues
caused by malnutrition
earlier in their lives.
They're also at higher risk
of anxiety, depression, and PTSD.
The suicide rate among North
Korean defectors in South Korea
is three times higher than South Koreans,
and I think South Korea
is one of the most
high-suicide-rate countries.
- Narrator: Another challenge?
Understanding freedom
and victory it brings.
- To me, freedom was wearing jeans,
or watching movies, or
listening to hip-hop songs.
And, that's how simple it was.
Maybe wearing earrings,
because in North Korea we
don't have any freedom.
They tell us what to wear,
what to listen, what to watch.
In South Korea, for
instance, if you go shop,
there are so many tons of kinds of pants.
You gotta choose what you want to wear.
That's very simple, even
that was overwhelming for me.
But, I am very grateful that
I was born in North Korea,
today, because I'm the winner.
I survived, I fought for my freedom.
It was not given to me,
but I fought for it.
So, I want the
North Korean defectors
struggling in South Korea,
that you should be very proud of yourself,
and don't listen to anyone
say that you are not enough,
that you are different,
you are not going to win.
You are the winner already.
