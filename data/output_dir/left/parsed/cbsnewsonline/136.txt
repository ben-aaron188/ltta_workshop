IT IS JUST THIS. 
BUT, YOU MAKE ME FEEL WELCOME. 
SO, THAT IS AWESOME. 
I HAVE COME HERE FOR A LONG 
TIME, THE STATE MEANS A LOT TO 
ME. 
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW, I AM A BIG 
SHOOTER AND HUNTER AND 
FISHERMAN. 
>> THAT IS ALSO WHY I FEEL 
RIDICULOUS IN THE SUIT, BUT I 
WILL DO IT. 
OKAY? 
I HAVE BEEN COMING OUT HERE 
SINCE THE FIRST GOT A CAR. 
I WOULD LIVE IN THE BACK OF MY 
TRUCK AND FISH ALL THE RIVERS 
AND REALLY GOT TO KNOW THE 
STATE. 
THE REASON I GOT INTO MONTANA 
POLITICS WAS BECAUSE I MET YOUR 
SENATOR, STEVE DAINES IN ELK 
CAMP. 
I WAS IN ELK CAMP, I BROUGHT MY 
LITTLE SON. 
THIS WAS THANKSGIVING A COUPLE 
OF YEARS AGO. 
MY SIX-YEAR-OLD AT THE TIME, WE 
WERE DOING A GOOD LITTLE FAMILY 
FATHER SON TRIP AND I RAN INTO 
STEVE. 
WE STARTED TO TALK. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK? 
DID I SHOOT ONE? 
COME ON, MAN. 
COME ON. 
UNLIKE JOHN TESTER, WHO ONLY 
STARTED BUYING HUNTING TAGS 
WHEN THE GOP CALLED HIM OUT FOR 
NOT BEING A HUNTER. YOU KNOW 
THAT HE WENT 15 YEARS WITHOUT A 
HUNTING LICENSE, AND HE 
PRETENDS LIKE HE IS A HUNTER. 
HE WENT 15 YEARS UNTIL HE 
CALLED HIM OUT FOR IT. 
THAT IS WHY WE CALL HIM TO FACE 
TESTER. 
YOU CAN'T SAY YOU ARE ONE 
THING, YOU CAN'T SHOW UP IN 
BLAZE ORANGE BUT YOU HAVE NOT 
BOUGHT A HUNTING LICENSE IN 15 
YEARS, THAT DOES NOT WORK IN 
MONTANA, RIGHT? 
YOU COULD MAKE THAT WORK IN NEW 
YORK CITY, BUT NOT THIS SIDE OF 
THE MISSISSIPPI. 
SO, I WAS OUT AT HUNTING CAMP 
AND WE HAVE THIS GREAT 
FRIENDSHIP GOING. 
SO MANY OF THE GREAT OUTDOOR 
EXPERIENCES THAT I HAVE HAD ON 
THE RIVERS HERE YOU KNOW, WITH 
MY SON. 
I GOT TO KNOW THIS GUY. 
THAT IS A WAY THAT YOU GET TO 
KNOW SOMEBODY. 
NOT IN A BOARD ROOM, NOT ACROSS 
THE TABLE AT NEGOTIATION, NOT 
EVEN IN POLITICS. 
BUT, SHOWING HIM AROUND A 
CAMPFIRE. 
HE REALLY GET TO KNOW SOMEONE. 
AND I GOT TO KNOW STEVE. 
AND, THEN YOUR GREAT 
CONGRESSMAN WAS RUNNING. 
THEY SAID DON -- WOULD YOU COME 
OUT TO MONTANA? 
I SAID I AM FROM NEW YORK CITY. 
I'M NOT SURE IF I WILL FLY IN 
MONTANA, IT TURNS OUT IT WORKED 
REALLY WELL. 
WE HAD A GREAT TIME, WE REALLY 
MOVED THE NEEDLE. 
WE GOT TO DO A LITTLE SHOOTING. 
WE EVEN DID SOME PRAIRIE 
DOGGING. 
BUT BY THE TIME THE NEW YORK 
TIMES GOT A HOLD OF IT, WE WERE 
SHOOTING PREGNANT DOGS. 
NOT PRAIRIE DOGS. 
PREGNANT DOGS. 
SO, THAT WAS THE HEADLINE. 
I WAS SAYING -- I DON'T 
REMEMBER DOING THAT. 
BUT, WE HAD A GOOD TIME. 
THEY ARE HERE. 
COME ON, STEVE, GREG, GET UP 
HERE. 
>> THESE GUYS ARE THE REAL 
DEAL. 
I GOT TO KNOW THEM AT HUNTING 
CAMP. WE HAD A GOOD TIME. 
WHY DON'T YOU SAY SOMETHING. 
MAYBE HE CAN VOUCH FOR MY NEW 
YORK CREDIT. 
OKAY? 
>> LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, 
DONALD TRUMP JUNIOR IS A HECK 
OF A SHOT. 
BUT, I TELL YOU WHAT, EVERY 
MORNING I WAKE UP, AND I SAY -- 
THANK GOD HILLARY CLINTON IS 
NOT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
 
>> AND THEN, THERE IS ANOTHER 
THING TO SAY THANKS FOR, THANK 
GOD DONALD TRUMP IS. SO, I WANT 
TO THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE 
TRIP OUT HERE TODAY. 
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 
BRINGING YOUR DAD ALONG. 
AND WE HAD A GREAT FLIGHT OUT 
WITH THE PRESIDENT, WE SAW THE 
BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES OF MONTANA 
AS WE LANDED A FEW MINUTES AGO. 
SO, THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT. 
THANK YOU FOR MAKING AMERICA 
GREAT AGAIN. 
 
>> COME ON, HE HAD TO SAY A 
COUPLE WORDS ALSO. 
>> HELLO, MONTANA. 
 
>> WELL, I GOT REALLY CLEAR 
MARCHING ORDERS FROM YOU ALL, 
THAT WAS TO PROTECT OUR WAY OF 
LIFE AND DRAIN THE SWAMP. I AM 
PROUD TO SERVE WITH THIS GREAT 
PRESIDENT, GOT MORE WORK TO DO. 
HIS LEADERSHIP, THIS PRESIDENT 
-- HE HAS GIVEN THIS COUNTRY 
HOPE AGAIN. 
>> AND, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
 
>> I AM HONORED TO SERVE AS 
YOUR ONLY VOICE BACK AT THE 
HOUSE. 
GOD BLESS YOU AND THIS COUNTRY. 
>> THANK YOU GUYS. 
SO, WHY ARE WE HERE? 
WE ARE HERE BECAUSE WE ARE 
GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING 
ON IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW, 
WE ARE WINNING FOR THE FIRST 
TIME IN A LONG TIME. 
THE PEOPLE OF MONTANA, THEY GOT 
IT. 
THEY SAW IT IN 2016. 
THEY SAW WHAT WAS GOING ON, 
THEY HAD HEARD THE LIES THEY 
HAD BEEN FED TIME AND TIME 
AGAIN BY OUR REPRESENTATIVES 
AND THEY VOTED TO PUT SOMEONE 
IN THERE WHO WAS GOING TO TAKE 
ON THAT SYSTEM, SOMEONE WHO 
WOULD FIGHT FOR AMERICA. 
SOMEONE WHO IS ACTUALLY GOING 
TO PUT AMERICA FIRST. 
 
>> NOW, IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE, 
IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT WE 
LIVE IN A TIME -- WE -- WERE 
TALKING ABOUT PUTTING AMERICANS 
FIRST IS A BAD THING, RIGHT? 
I MEAN, I FEEL STUPID WHEN I 
TURN ON THE TV. 
PEOPLE IN FAR-OFF LANDS WHO 
HATE OUR GUTS, THEY HATE OUR 
FREEDOMS, THEY HATE OUR 
RELIGION, THEY HATE EVERYTHING 
ABOUT US. 
THESE PEOPLE ARE MORE CONCERNED 
ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS -- THAT IS 
A BIG DEAL THESE DAYS. 
THEIR FEELINGS, THEN THEY ARE 
THE SAFETY AND WELL-BEING OF 
OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS. 
AND THAT DOESN'T WORK. 
WHEN I LOOK AT THE DEMOCRATIC 
PLATFORM, I SAY I DON'T KNOW. 
I'M LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS. 
I SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. 
I SEE ALL-TIME LOW 
UNEMPLOYMENT. 
THE GREATEST JOB REPORTS EVER. 
WHEN THE NEW YORK TIMES SAYS WE 
DO NOT HAVE THE WORDS TO 
DESCRIBE HOW GOOD THESE JOB 
NUMBERS ARE, TRUST ME -- THAT 
WAS NOT EASY FOR THEM TO WRITE. 
THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT, NOT ONE 
LITTLE BIT. 
I AM SAYING -- WHAT IS THE 
OTHER SIDE'S PLATFORM? 
EIGHT IS NOT A PLATFORM. 
PAGE DOESN'T PUT FOOD ON THE 
TABLE. 
PAGE DOESN'T EDUCATE YOUR KIDS. 
PAGE DOESN'T KEEP YOU SAFE. 
ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE 
DOING, I CANNOT THINK OF A 
SINGLE MEASUREMENT WHERE WE ARE 
NOT BETTER OFF TODAY THAN WE 
WERE 18 MONTHS AGO. 
 
>> AND YET -- AND YET, THEY RUN 
ON THIS PLATFORM, EVERYTHING 
TRUMP DOES IS TERRIBLE. 
IF DONALD TRUMP CAME OUT IN 
FAVOR OF OXYGEN, THE DEMOCRATS 
WOULD SAY WE ARE AGAINST IT. 
MAYBE A GOOD TACTIC, I'M JUST 
KIDDING, BECAUSE THEY WILL SAY 
THAT I'M TRYING TO KILL PEOPLE. 
BUT, THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE 
GOTTEN, OKAY? 
WHEN I LOOK AT JOHN TESTER AND 
THIS RACE, HE SAYS ALL THE 
THINGS HE VOTED FOR TRUMP ON. 
HE TOOK OUT FULL-PAGE ADS. 
OH, WAIT A MINUTE, WHERE WAS HE 
ON JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH?  
WHERE WAS HE ON SANCTUARY 
CITIES? 
DO YOU WANT MONTANA TO BE A 
SANCTUARY STATE? 
AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY -- THE 
BIG ONE -- WHERE WAS HE ON TAX 
REFORM? 
OKAY? 
YOU KNOW WHERE HE WAS? 
HE WAS WITH CHUCK SCHUMER AND 
NANCY PELOSI. 
HE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. 
THE BIG ONE, THE ONE THAT PUTS 
MONEY IN YOUR POCKET. 
THE ONE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO TAKE 
CARE OF FAMILY. 
THE ONE THAT PUT FOOD ON THE 
TABLE. 
HE WAS NOT THERE FOR THAT ONE. 
HE SAID IT WAS ONE OF THE 
EXPLETIVE WORST BILLS EVER PUT 
BEFORE THE SENATE. THINK ABOUT 
THAT. 
THE BILL THAT IS ALLOWING ALL 
OF THESE COMPANIES TO BRING 
BACK THIS MONEY THAT IS PAYING 
BONUSES TO THEIR EMPLOYEES AND 
EMPLOYING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE. 
ALL-TIME LOW JOB NUMBERS. 
ALL THOSE POSITIVE THINGS, 
BECAUSE OF THIS BILL, HE WAS 
AGAINST IT. 
REMEMBER THAT, BECAUSE WHEN ALL 
THIS CALIFORNIA MONEY, WHEN ALL 
THIS NEW YORK MONEY STARTS 
POURING INTO THIS RACE, TO FEED 
HIS CAMPAIGN, AND THOSE LIES, 
REMEMBER WHERE HE WAS. 
REMEMBER TO STAY MOTIVATED, 
BECAUSE THE ONE THING IS -- I 
SEE A LOT OF TRUMP PEOPLE IN 
THIS ROOM --  
>> -- BUT, YOU HAVE TO STAY IN 
IT. 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME 
ENTHUSIASM FOR ALL OF THESE 
GUYS. 
AND FOR ROSENDALE, AND FOR 
EVERYONE AS YOU HAD FOR DONALD 
TRUMP. 
EVEN THOUGH HE IS NOT ON THE 
TICKET IN 2018,  THAT DOES NOT 
MEAN THAT EVERYTHING THAT HE 
HAS ACCOMPLISHED IS NOT ON THE 
TICKET. 
THE OTHER SIDE WANTS TO GET RID 
OF IT ALL. 
YOU HAVE TO STAY IN THIS FIGHT. 
YOU HAVE TO STAY MOTIVATED. 
YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR FRIENDS 
OUT THERE AND YOU HAVE TO TURN 
UP TO VOTE IN NOVEMBER. 
THAT IS GOING TO MAKE THE 
DIFFERENCE. 
THAT IS GOING TO BE EVERYTHING. 
OKAY YOU MARK I'M GOING TO BE 
COMING OUT HERE A LOT THIS 
FALL, HELPING ALL OF THESE GUYS,
I WOULD RATHER DO IT WITH A BOW 
OR A FLY ROD, BUT WE WILL DO 
THAT IN NOVEMBER AFTER 
EVERYTHING. 
BUT, WE ARE GOING TO BE OUT 
THERE FIGHTING FOR MONTANA. 
WE ARE GOING TO DO WHAT WE HAVE 
ALWAYS SAID WE ARE GOING TO DO. 
WE WILL A■LSO FIGHT FOR PUBLIC 
LAND. 
ALL RIGHT? 
THAT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS AS 
THEY COME OUT THERE AND THEY 
SAY WE ARE SELLING TALKING 
ABOUT? 
BUT, THAT IS THE BIG SOUNDBITE 
FOR THE OUTDOORSMEN. 
THE REALITY IS NOT TRUE BUT 
NOBODY IS GOING TO LOOK BEYOND 
THAT. 
IF YOU MARK REMEMBER WHAT WE 
ARE DOING, LOOK AT THE 
POLICIES. 
DO NOT BUY EVERYTHING THAT YOU 
READ. 
ADVERTISING CAN BUY AND SELL A 
LOT OF GARBAGE. 
VERY TRUE. 
THERE IS A LOT OF IT THESE 
DAYS, MAN. 
THAT IS THE REALITY. 
THINK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF 
WINNING WE COULD HAVE IF YOU 
HAD A LITTLE COOPERATION WITH 
THE MEDIA. 
IF THEY WERE HALF IS FRIENDLY 
TO US, WE DO NOT EVEN NEED ALL 
OF THE FRIENDLY THAT THEY WERE 
FOR OUR PREDECESSOR WHICH WAS 
-- HE COULD DO NO -- NO WRONG. 
IF THEY WERE 1/10 IS FRIENDLY, 
YOU GET RID OF THE NONSENSE AND 
THE NOISE, THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH 
MORE YOU COULD DO. 
THAT IS WHY YOU ARE SO 
IMPORTANT, THAT IS WHY MONTANA 
IS RELEVANT RIGHT NOW. 
THAT IS WHAT THESE GUYS ARE 
FIGHTING FOR EVERY DAY. 
AND THAT IS WHAT MATT ROSENDALE 
WILL FIGHT FOR IN NOVEMBER.  
 
>> I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THAT. 
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER WHAT WAS 
IN YOUR HEARTS IN NOVEMBER IN 
2016. 
KEEP THAT GOING. 
KEEP THAT FIGHT. 
KEEP THAT SPIRIT. 
GET OUT THERE, BRING YOUR 
FRIENDS, MAKE SURE THAT YOU 
SEND A MESSAGE TO WASHINGTON DC 
THAT YOU WANT THE JT TO 
CONTINUE WHAT HE IS DOING. 
THIS IS WHAT WILL HELP OUR 
KIDS, OUR GRANDKIDS, AND IS THE 
FATHER OF FIVE YOUNG KIDS, I 
WANT TO LEAVE THEM IN AMERICA 
THAT WE HAVE GOTTEN USED TO, 
BECAUSE THE ONE THAT I SEE ON 
TV THESE DAYS, IT IS A FOREIGN 
COUNTRY. 
OKAY? 
REMEMBER IT, KEEP THAT SPIRIT 
IN THAT FIGHT IN YOUR HEART, 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING 
US OUT HERE AND BEING SO 
WELCOME. 
IT IS AWESOME TO BE HERE. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MONTANA. 
  
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS EXPECTED 
TO SPEAK IN GREAT FALLS, 
MONTANA ANY MOMENT. 
WE WILL HAVE THAT RALLY FOR YOU 
LIVE. 
AS WE WAIT FOR THE PRESIDENT WE 
WILL GIVE YOU SOME OF THE OTHER 
DAYS HEADLINES AFTER THE BREAK. 
YOU ARE STREAMING RED AND BLUE. 
-- CBSN. 
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN 
MONTANA  FOR A RALLY IN SUPPORT 
OF CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES. 
IN HIS REMARKS, HE WILL 
UNDOUBTEDLY ADDRESS HIS 
UPCOMING DECISION TO FILL
JUSTICE ANTHONY KENNEDY'S SEAT. 
ACCORDING TO THE WALL STREET 
JOURNAL HE HAS NARROWED DOWN 
HIS NOMINEES TO THREE FEDERAL 
COURT JUDGES. 
AMY CONEY BARRETT, BRETT 
CAVANAUGH, AND AARON COVERAGE. 
HE HELD A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS 
THIS WEEK. 
THEIR REMAINING TIGHTLIPPED ON 
WHO HAS MADE THE CUT. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL ANNOUNCE 
THE NOMINEE ON MONDAY. 
>>> WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT 
HOW THE PRESIDENT IS 
APPROACHING THIS PROCESS? 
>> WELL, THIS IS CLEARLY GOING 
TO BE SOME KIND OF VICTORY FOR 
THE PRESIDENT, WHATEVER 
HAPPENS. 
HE IS GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO CHANGE THE IDEOLOGICAL 
COMPLEXION OF THE COURT BY 
REPLACING A SWING VOTE IN TERMS 
OF HAVING A CAN WITH A 
COMMITTED CONSERVATIVE, THAT 
WOULD BE TRUE OF ANY OF THE 
THREE THAT YOU MENTIONED. 
WE DO HERE SOME SUGGESTION THAT 
THE PRESIDENT MIGHT FAVOR BRETT 
CAVANAUGH WHO IS SLIGHTLY OLDER 
AND HAS A BIT MORE EXPERIENCE 
ON THE BENCH. 
THE KNOCK AGAINST CAVANAUGH IS 
THAT HE IS A VETERAN OF THE 
GEORGE W. BUSH ADMINISTRATION, 
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS -- A WELL-
KNOWN SUSPICION OR SKEPTICISM OF
BUSH VETERANS. 
>> IT IS ALWAYS INTERESTING 
WHEN NAMES GET LEAKED, THEY ARE 
USUALLY LEAKED FOR A PURPOSE. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PURPOSE 
BEHIND THIS LEAK WAS TODAY? 
>> PART OF THAT IS JUST THE 
IDEA THAT WE KNOW ALREADY, THE 
PRESIDENT IS WORKING OFF A LIST 
OF 25 NAMES THAT WERE DRAWN UP 
IN CONNECTION WITH THE 
FEDERALIST SOCIETY, A FEDERAL 
URBANIZATION -- A CONSERVATIVE 
ORGANIZATION. 
I WOULD ASSUME THE PURPOSE OF 
LEAKING THESE NAMES IS TO 
SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE THE FRONT-
RUNNERS. 
I DO NOT THINK THERE THE FRONT 
RUNNERS. 
IT IS NOT MISDIRECTION I DO NOT 
THINK. 
BUT, THE PRESIDENT DOES HAVE AN 
APPRECIATION FOR THE KIND OF 
SUSPENSE THAT CAN BE CREATED IN 
THESE MOMENTS. 
HE SEES THINGS THROUGH A 
TELEVISION LENS OFTEN. 
AND, THIS IS THE FINAL 
CONTESTANTS IN THE SUPREME 
COURT REALITY SHOW. 
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ALSO -- 
YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK AT THESE 
LIBERAL TROOPS THAT ARE 
PLANNING TO TARGET REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS LISA MURKOWSKI AND 
BLOCKED THE SUPREME COURT 
CONFIRMATION, MUCH THE WAY THEY 
ATTACKED THE REPEAL OF OBAMA 
CARE. 
WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE TRYING 
TO DO TO PUSH BACK? 
>> ESSENTIALLY, IT IS SIMPLY 
THAT REPUBLICAN SENATORS WOULD 
BE EXPECTED TO VOTE FOR A 
CONSERVATIVE JUSTICE SELECTED 
BY A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT. 
THEY ARE MAKING A CALL TO PARTY 
LOYALTY. 
AND, ALSO WE HAVE TO REMEMBER, 
GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE 
2016 CAMPAIGN, THE SUPREME 
COURT WAS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR 
CONSERVATIVE VOTERS. 
IT GOT A LOT OF THEM OVER THE 
MISGIVING ABOUT HIS COLORFUL 
PERSONAL LIFE IN THE 
BELLIGERENT LANGUAGE THAT HE 
USES, BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT 
IS SO IMPORTANT. 
I THINK THAT THE WHITE HOUSE 
CAN EXERT CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE 
ON THOSE MODERATES LIKE SUSAN 
COLLINS AND LISA MURKOWSKI, TO 
SAY THIS IS CRITICAL AND WILL 
SET THE DIRECTION. 
THESE POTENTIAL NOMINEES ARE 
COMPARATIVELY YOUTHFUL. 
SO, THAT IS A BIG -- ♪ ♪

THE STAGE RIGHT NOW IN GREAT

BUT, HE IS AN INCREDIBLE 
SUCCESS. 
HE DID A REALLY GOOD JOB.

FINALLY, THE PERSON THAT WE ARE 
HERE FOR TONIGHT, A VERY 
SPECIAL PERSON, HE RAN AN 
INCREDIBLE PRIMARY, WOULDN'T 
YOU SAY? 
RIGHT? 
ANYTIME YOU WIN, IT IS 
INCREDIBLE. 
BUT, HE DID. 
HE WAS UP AGAINST GOOD 
COMPETITION. 
AND, HE IS GOING TO BE YOUR 
NEXT SENATOR FROM THE 
INCREDIBLE STATE OF MONTANA, 
MATT ROSENDALE.  
COME UP, MATT. 
 
>> HELLO, MONTANA. 
 DO WE HAVE AN 
INCREDIBLE PRESIDENT, OR WHAT? 
 WE ACTUALLY HAVE A 
PRESIDENT WHO FIGHTS EVERY 
SINGLE DAY FOR THE PEOPLE 
ACROSS THIS GREAT NATION. 
 AND, HERE AT HOME, 
HE IS FIGHTING FOR OUR MILITARY 
MEN AND WOMEN, SERVING RIGHT 
HERE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
AND FOR ALL OUR VETERANS, AND 
FOR OUR SENIORS, IS FIGHTING 
FOR OUR FOLKS WORKING IN THE 
TIMBER INDUSTRY, AND OUR ENERGY 
PRODUCTION. HE IS FIGHTING FOR 
OUR HARD-WORKING FARMERS AND 
RANCHERS, ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
STATE. 
AND, YOU KNOW HE IS FIGHTING 
FOR OUR MINORS DOWN IN BUTTE. 
AND, THOSE COAL WORKERS, AND 
OTHERS WHO PRODUCE THAT 
BEAUTIFUL CLEAN COAL. HE IS 
ALSO FIGHTING FOR EVERYONE 
ACROSS OUR STATE WHO FEELS 
THEIR VOICES NOT BEING HEARD, 
INCLUDING THE UNBORN. 
 
>> AND I WILL BE THAT VOICE FOR 
YOU, IF YOU ELECT ME TO THE 
UNITED STATES SENATE. 
 AND I WILL FIGHT 
FOR YOU EVERY DAY, BECAUSE I 
MEAN BUSINESS ABOUT STANDING 
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP TO MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
 BECAUSE, WHAT IS 
GOOD FOR AMERICA IS GREAT FOR 
MONTANA. 
TODAY, I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE SO 
THAT I CAN HELP PRESIDENT TRUMP 
TO CONTINUE HIS GOOD WORK.  
THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP.  
THANK YOU MONTANA. 
AND, GOD BLESS EACH AND 
EVERYONE OF YOU, AND THE GREAT 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 
 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THAT 
WAS GREAT. 
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD MAN. 
THIS IS A MAN THAT LOVES THE 
PEOPLE OF MONTANA. 
HE LOVES THE PEOPLE OF THIS 
COUNTRY. 
IT IS TIME TO RETIRE LIBERAL 
DEMOCRAT JOHN TESTER. 
 
>> YOU ARE GOING TO GET A REAL 
MONTANA FIGHTER, YOU SEE IT -- 
IF YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING, YOU 
KNOW THAT HE IS A TOUGH COOKIE. 
HE IS A FIGHTER. 
HE IS GOING TO FIGHT FOR YOU. 
MATT ROSENDALE. 
  SO, JOHN TESTER 
SAYS ONE THING WHEN HE IS IN 
MONTANA, BUT I WILL TELL YOU -- 
I AM A TESTAMENT TO IT, HE DOES 
THE OPPOSITE WHEN HE GOES TO 
WASHINGTON. 
A VOTE FOR JOHN TESTER IS A 
VOTE FOR CHUCK SCHUMER, NANCY 
PELOSI, -- AND, THE NEW LEADER 
OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, MAXINE 
WATERS -- WHERE HAVE THEY GONE? 
JOHN TESTER VOTED NO ON 
REPEALING OBAMA CARE AND EVEN 
THOUGH WE GOT A LITTLE SURPRISE 
VOTE THAT EVENING, YOU ALL 
REMEMBER THAT EVENING, SOMEONE 
CAME IN WITH A THUMBS DOWN 
AFTER CAMPAIGNING FOR YEARS 
THAT HE WAS GOING TO REPEAL AND 
REPLACE. 
BUT, THAT IS OKAY. 
BECAUSE, WE -- FOR THE MOST 
PART, WE HAVE ALREADY DONE IT. 
AND, WE HAVE GREAT HEALTHCARE 
COMING OUT, AND IT'S JUST CAME 
OUT TWO WEEKS AGO. 
AND, WE GOT RID OF THE 
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, AND LOTS OF 
OTHER THINGS. 
 SOMETIMES WE HAVE 
TO DO IT THE HARD WAY, BUT THAT 
IS OKAY ALSO. 
JOHN TESTER VOTED NO ON TAX CUTS
FOR MONTANA FAMILIES HE VOTED NO
ON CUTTING THE ESTATE TAX, OR 
THE DEATH TAX FOR YOUR FARMS, 
YOUR FARMERS, AND YOUR SMALL 
BUSINESSES. 
THINK OF THAT ONE. 
THINK OF THAT ONE. 
BUT, YOU GOT IT ANYWAY, BECAUSE 
WE GOT IT PASSED. 
SO, ON YOUR FARMS -- FOR THE 
MOST PART, YOU WILL HAVE NO 
ESTATE TAX NOR DEATH TAX TO 
PAY. 
YOU CAN LEAVE YOUR FARM, YOU 
CAN LEAVE YOUR SMALL BUSINESS, 
TO YOUR CHILDREN, OR WHOEVER 
YOU WANT TO LEAVE -- DON'T 
ALWAYS LEAVE IT TO THE CHILDREN.
IF THE CHILDREN ARE GOOD 
CHILDREN, DON'T -- LEAVE IT TO 
SOMEBODY ELSE. 
BUT, YOU HAVE NO TAX TO PAY. 
PRETTY GOOD, RIGHT? 
NOBODY THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING 
TO HAPPEN. 
TESTER VOTED AGAINST IT, HE 
VOTED NO ON LEGISLATION TO STOP 
LATE-TERM ABORTIONS. 
YOU WOULDN'T THINK IT WOULD 
PLAY VERY WELL OUT HERE. 
HOW DID HE GET ELECTED? 
I MEAN, I KNOW -- I KNOW A LOT 
OF PEOPLE FROM MONTANA. YOU 
HAVE TO EXPLAIN THAT ONE TO ME, 
HOW DID HE GET ELECTED? 
ALL RIGHT. 
YOU CAN WRITE YOUR WRONG IN 
NOVEMBER, OKAY? 
YOU CAN CORRECT YOUR WRONG. 
MATT ROSENDALE.  
TESTER VOTED NO ON CASE LAW. 
THAT IS LEGISLATION NAMED FOR 
KATE STEINLE, WHO WAS GUNNED 
DOWN BY A FIVE-TIME DEPORTED 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT. 
YOU DESERVE A SENATOR WHO DOES 
NOT JUST TALK LIKE HE IS FROM 
MONTANA, YOU DESERVE A SENATOR 
WHO ACTUALLY VOTES LIKE HE IS 
FROM MONTANA.  
TESTER EVEN VOTED NO ON ENHANCED
EDITING FOR REFUGEES FROM 
TERROR STRICKEN COUNTRIES, DO 
YOU BELIEVE THIS ONE? 
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THAT? 
THE DEMOCRATS WANT OPEN 
BORDERS, WHICH MEANS LOTS OF 
CRIME. 
WE WANT TOUGH, STRONG, POWERFUL 
BORDERS, AND WE WANT TO KNOW 
CRIME, AND WE ARE GOING TO 
PROTECT ICE. 
WE PROTECT ICE. 
THEY PROTECT US, AND WE PROTECT 
THEM. 
THEY PROTECT US, AND WE PROTECT 
THEM. 
HE SAW THAT CLOWN YESTERDAY 
WITH THE -- THE STATUE OF 
LIBERTY, YOU SEE THE GUYS THAT 
WENT UP THERE -- I WOULDN'T 
HAVE DONE IT. 
I WOULD HAVE SAID LET'S GET 
SOME NUTS AND WAIT UNTIL SHE 
COMES DOWN. 
JUST GET SOME NUTS. 
YOU SEE THE BRAVERY OF DOING 
THAT? 
A LOT -- WHAT A GROUP. 
WE PROTECT ICE, AND OUR BORDER 
PATROL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
 AND OUR FIRE 
DEPARTMENTS, AND OUR FIRE 
DEPARTMENTS. 
WE PROTECT OUR PEOPLE. 
JOHN TESTER OPPOSED OUR TRAVEL 
BAN TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE, WHICH 
BY THE WAY, I AM PROUD TO 
REPORT, LAST WEEK THE SUPREME 
COURT OF THE UNITED STATES JUST 
UPHELD THE TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. [ 
APPLAUSE ] AND THEY GAVE US THE 
AUTHORITY TO PROTECT OUR NATION 
AND KEEP OUR NATION SAFE . WE 
ARE GOING TO KEEP IT SAFE. 
AS YOU KNOW, THERE IS NOW A 
VACANCY ON THE SUPREME COURT 
AND IF YOU TUNE IN MONDAY AT 
NINE, I THINK THAT YOU WILL BE 
EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THE 
SELECTION, RIGHT? 
THEY ARE ALL GREAT. 
THEY ARE ALL GREAT. 
AND I WANT TO THANK JUSTICE 
KENNEDY FOR HIS LIFETIME OF 
TRULY DISTINGUISHED SERVICE. 
HE HAD CONFIDENCE IN ME. 
HE LEFT BECAUSE HE SAID HE WILL 
PICK SOMEBODY GREAT. 
AND, SO NICE, SO NICE. 
 GREAT MAN, A GREAT 
GENTLEMAN. 
JOHN TESTER VOTED AGAINST NEIL 
GORSUCH, THE INCREDIBLE JUSTICE 
WHO SUPPORTS FULLY OUR 
CONSTITUTION. 
THAT IS A HARD ONE TO VOTE 
AGAINST, ISN'T IT? 
TESTER OPPOSED MANY OF OUR 
AMAZINGJUDGES. 
AND YET, I SEE JOHN TESTER 
SAYING SUCH NICE THINGS ABOUT 
ME I SAY YEAH, BUT HE NEVER 
VOTES FOR ME. 
HE NEVER VOTES. 
AND, I WOULD RATHER HAVE HIM 
SAY BAD ABOUT ME, BUT VOTE, 
RIGHT? 
YET, JOHN TESTER VOTED FOR 
LIBERAL OBAMA JUDGES WHO TRIED 
TO TAKE AWAY YOUR SECOND 
AMENDMENT, TRIED TO TAKE IT 
AWAY. 
BECAUSE TESTER DOESN'T SHARE 
YOUR VALUES. 
JOHN TESTER SHOWED HIS TRUE 
COLORS WITH HIS SHAMEFUL, 
DISHONEST ATTACKS ON A GREAT MAN
, A FRIEND OF MINE, A MAN THAT 
I SAID WHY DON'T YOU RUN THE 
VA? 
YOU WOULD BE GREAT. 
MAYBE ADMIRAL RONNIE JACKSON? 
AND THE REPORTS JUST CAME OUT, 
AND I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT IT, 
BECAUSE  WOULD HAVE READ IT, 
BUT IT IS LONG BUT BEAUTIFUL 
FOR RONNIE JACKSON. 
SECRET SERVICE ARE ALL OVER THE 
PLACE. 
THEY WROTE A REPORT THAT WHAT 
HE SAID WAS SO FALSE AND SO 
UNTRUE. 
IT NEVER HAPPENED. 
AND, THEY COULD HAVE RUINED -- 
THEY COULD HAVE HER AND A 
LESSER MAN. 
BUT, DR. JACKSON --; BOTH? 
HE IS AN ADMIRAL, HE IS A 
DOCTOR -- HIS SON IS A TOP -- 
REALLY, A TOP LIKE A TOP-TOP 
STUDENT AT ANNAPOLIS. 
HE GRADUATED THIS YEAR. 
HE IS INCREDIBLE. HAS AN 
INCREDIBLE FAMILY. 
YOU KNOW, I FEEL GUILTY. 
ADMIRAL JACKSON WAS GETTING 
READY TO LEAVE THE SERVICE AND 
HE SERVED MANY YEARS ADMIRABLY. 
NOT A BLEMISH. 
A LOT OF YOU KNOW -- HE 
ACTUALLY SAID I WAS HEALTHY. 
HE IS THE ONE. 
WHEN THE FAKE NEWS STARTED 
SAYING WHY IS AND TRUMP GIVING 
THE PHYSICAL? 
WHY? 
DR. JACKSON AND HIS STAFF, THEY 
WENT OUT AND THEY GAVE ME A 
PHYSICAL, THAT WAS A PHYSICAL. 
AND WHEN THEY SAID I AM VERY 
HEALTHY, THE NEWS WAS 
DEVASTATED. 
THEY DID NOT WANT TO HEAR THAT. 
BUT, HE IS A GREAT FAMILY MAN. 
AND I SAID TO HIM -- I FEEL 
GUILTY. 
I SAID HEY, DOC -- WHY DON'T 
YOU RUN THE VA? 
YOU ARE A LEADER, AND 
ADMIRABLE. 
HE IS AND ADMIRE GUY. 
>> WELL I WASN'T THINKING OF 
THAT. 
>> I SAID YOU WOULD BE GREAT. 
GO AHEAD AND DO IT. 
>> SIR, WHATEVER YOUR ORDER, I 
WILL DO. 
>> IS LIKE -- EVEN IF HE DID 
NOT WANT TO DO IT, HE SAID THAT 
TO ME. 
 
>> IN FACT, YOUR GREAT FIRST 
LADY SAID TO ME THAT SUNDAY, 
WELL, DID YOU WANT TO DO IT? 
I SAID I DON'T KNOW. 
HE SAID HE WOULD DO IT. 
BUT, THAT WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT 
IT, I DON'T KNOW. 
BUT, HE SAID IF YOU ASK, I WILL 
DO IT. 
BUT, HE DID NOT REALLY WANT TO 
DO IT. 
SO, I SORT OF FEEL GUILTY ABOUT 
THIS WHOLE THING. 
BECAUSE, WHAT HAPPENED IS HE 
SAID SIR, IF YOU WOULD LIKE ME 
TO DO IT, I WILL DO IT. 
IT WAS NOT WHAT HE HAD IN MIND. 
I PUT THEM INTO THE WORLD OF 
POLITICS. 
HOW VICIOUS IS THE WORLD? 
BUT, JOHN TESTER SAID THINGS 
ABOUT HIM THAT WERE HORRIBLE, 
AND THAT WERE NOT TRUE. 
AND THAT IS PROBABLY WHY I AM 
HERE, BECAUSE I WON MONTANA BY 
SO MANY POINTS I DON'T HAVE TO 
COME HERE. 
 
>> YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE 
FROM STATES WHERE WE HAVE THESE 
BIG LEADS. 
WE HAD 42 AND 44 -- WE WON BY 
44 POINTS OVER A DEMOCRAT. 
WE WON BY 44 POINTS OVER A 
DEMOCRAT, IT WAS CROOKED 
HILLARY, BUT STILL -- SHE IS A 
DEMOCRAT. 
AND -- YOU. 
NO, SHE GET SPECIAL TREATMENT. 
SORRY, SORRY -- SHE GET SPECIAL 
TREATMENT UNDER THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT. 
>> SORRY, SORRY, SHE GET 
SPECIAL TREATMENT UNDER THE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. 
ANYBODY ELSE IN AMERICA -- HOW 
ABOUT THAT FBI AGENT, HOW ABOUT 
THAT GUY? 
YOU THINK YOU LIKED ME? 
YOU THINK HE LIKED ME? 
YOU THINK THERE WAS A LITTLE 
BIASED THERE? 
A LITTLE BIAS? 
OH, DID WE CATCH THEM IN THE 
ACT. 
IT IS A RIG TO DEAL FOLKS, IT 
IS A RIG TO DEAL. 
I USED TO SAY IT. 
IT IS A RIGGED DEAL. 
IT IS A DISGRACE. 
AND, WE GO AWAY ON MONDAY, WE 
APPOINT AND GO AWAY, I WILL SEE 
A LOT OF PEOPLE. 
I WILL SEE NATO, AND I WILL 
TELL NATO, YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR 
BILLS. 
THE UNITED STATES IS NOT GOING 
TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING. 
WE ARE PAYING FOR ANYWHERE FROM 
70-90% TO PROTECT EUROPE, AND 
THAT IS FINE. 
OF COURSE, THE KILL US ON 
TRADE. 
THEY KILL US ON OTHER THINGS. 
THEY MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DO 
BUSINESS IN EUROPE, YET THEY 
COME IN AND SELL THEIR MERCEDES 
AND BMWS TO US. 
SO, WE HAVE $151 BILLION IN 
TRADE DEFICITS WITH THE EU AND 
ON TOP OF THAT, THEY KILL US 
WITH NATO, THEY KILL US. 
SO, WE PAY 4% OF A HUGE GDP, 
WHICH GOT BIGGER SINCE I BECAME 
YOUR PRESIDENT. 
 AND GERMANY -- 
GERMANY WHICH IS THE BIGGEST 
COUNTRY OF THE EU, GERMANY PAYS 
1%, 1%. 
AND I SAID YOU KNOW -- I CAN'T 
GUARANTEE IT, BUT WE ARE 
PROTECTING YOU, AND IT MEANS 
MORE TO YOU THAN PROTECTING US, 
BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH 
PROTECTION WE GET BY PROTECTING 
YOU. 
AND THEN -- THEY GO OUT AND 
THEY MAKE A GAS DEAL, OIL AND 
GAS FROM RUSSIA, WHERE THEY PAY 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO RUSSIA 
OKAY? SO THEY WANT TO PROTECT 
AGAINST RUSSIA, YET THEY PAY 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO RUSSIA, 
AND WE ARE THE SMOCKS THAT HER 
PAIN FOR THE WHOLE THING. 
SO, THEN -- AND BY THE WAY, I 
HAVE TO SAY THIS -- SINCE I 
CAME, WHICH WAS A YEAR AND A 
HALF -- MORE THAN $33 BILLION 
MORE IS PROJECTED TO BE PAID BY 
THOSE NATO NATIONS. 
BUT, IT IS NOT ENOUGH. 
DO THEY EVER TELL YOU THAT? 
NO. 
NO. 
BUT, BUT, I WILL TELL YOU -- 
THE SECRETARY-GENERAL, 
STOLTENBERG, HE IS TRUMP'S 
BIGGEST FAN, HE SAID THOSE NATO 
NATIONS ARE ALL GOING LIKE 
THIS. 
LESS MONEY, LESS MONEY, WHY NOT?
AND, WHEN YOU CAME IN AND YOU 
STARTED TALKING, IT WENT LIKE A 
ROCKETSHIP. 
IT WENT JUST LIKE A ROCKETSHIP. 
 SO -- ANYTIME I 
SUGGEST ANYTHING, SO WE HAVE 
GOTTEN 33 BILLION -- IT IS 
GOING TO BE MORE MONEY THAN 
THAT. 
BUT, IF THEN THEY SAY -- OH, 
LET'S SEE. 
HE IS ANGRY AT NATO. 
I GUESS -- YOU. 
HE LOVES RUSSIA. 
I LOVE RUSSIA. 
I WILL SAY THIS -- I AM MEETING 
WITH PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN 
NEXT WEEKEND GETTING ALONG -- 
LET ME TELL YOU. 
GETTING ALONG WITH RUSSIA, AND 
GETTING ALONG WITH CHINA. 
AND GETTING ALONG WITH OTHER 
COUNTRIES. 
IT IS A GOOD THING. 
IT IS NOT A BAD THING. 
IT IS A GOOD THING. 
 I WOULD SAY FOR 
STUPID PEOPLE, OR FOR POLITICAL 
PEOPLE -- BECAUSE, THEY'RE NOT 
STUPID. 
ALL THEY ARE IS GOOD AT 
OBSTRUCTION AND RESISTIN. 
YOU KNOW, THEIR WHOLE THING IS 
RESIST, RIGHT? 
BUT -- EVERY TIME IT COMES UP, 
I WILL SAY THIS. 
I WILL HAVE TO ASK THEM THIS 
QUESTION, HOW THAT HAS IT BEEN 
SINCE TRUMP HAS BEEN IN? 
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED. 
WE HAVE JUST INCREASED OUR 
MILITARY SPENDING, WE ARE AT 
$700 BILLION. 
 WE HAVE BECOME A 
NATION THAT IS EXPORTING ENERGY 
FOR THE FIRST TIME. 
WE ARE EXPORTING ENERGY. 
SO MANY THINGS -- AND YOU LOOK 
AT ALL THE MONEY THAT NATO IS 
GETTING NOW. 
THEY ARE PROBABLY SAYING IN 
RUSSIA -- YOU KNOW, IF WE DID 
LIKE THIS GUY, WE MADE A 
MISTAKE. 
WE WOULD BE BETTER WITH CROOKED 
HILLARY CLINTON. 
I THINK THAT THEY WOULD RATHER 
HAVE HILLARY, BUT -- GETTING 
ALONG WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, AND 
YOU'RE TALKING NUCLEAR POWERS 
AND ALL FAIRNESS. 
GETTING ALONG IS REALLY A NICE 
THING. 
IT IS A SMART THING. 
WE ARE GOING TO BEAT EVERYBODY. 
WE HAVE THE GREATEST MILITARY. 
WE HAVE NOW -- HOPEFULLY, WE 
WILL NEVER HAVE TO USE IT. 
YOU KNOW, THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU 
ARE NEVER GOING TO HAVE TO USE 
IT? 
IF IT IS SO POWERFUL, GOOD, 
STRONG THAT NOBODY WANTS TO 
PLAY GAMES. 
AND, THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING. 
 WE WILL NEVER HAVE 
TO USE IT. 
OF COURSE, THEN WE HAVE NORTH 
KOREA, WHERE -- YOU NOTICE 
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION,
IT SEEMED LIKE A MISSILE A 
WEEK. 
A LOT OF MISSILES AND ROCKETS 
GOING UP, A LOT OF NUCLEAR 
TESTING. 
THEY THOUGHT THERE WAS AN 
EARTHQUAKE THE SIZE OF SOMETHING
THEY HAD NEVER TESTED BEFORE. 
THEY SAID WHERE IS IT? 
O, IT IS IN KOREA SOMEPLACE. 
THEY SAID WHY DON'T YOU CHECK 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS? 
IT WAS A NUCLEAR WEAPON, ALL 
RIGHT? 
SO, SINCE THE RHETORIC STOPPED, 
WOULDN'T YOU SAY THAT WAS 
TOUGH, RIGHT? 
SO, REMEMBER, THEY SAID HE IS 
TOO TOUGH. 
HE IS GOING TO CAUSE A WAR. 
IT IS TOO TOUGH. 
NOW, THEY SAY HE IS TOO NICE, 
HE IS TOO NICE. 
HE IS TOO NICE. 
I GOT ALONG VERY NICE WITH 
CHAIRMAN KIM, I GOT ALONG VERY  
I GOT ALONG WELL. 
NOW, WHAT HAS NOT HAPPENED IN 
EIGHT MONTHS? 
FIRST OF ALL, WE GOT OUR 
PRISONERS BACK BEFORE I EVEN 
LEFT, RIGHT? 
 AND I DID NOT PAY 
1.8 BILLION BY THE WAY, IN 
CASH. 
WE DID NOT PAID 1.8, RIGHT? 
WE PAID SLIGHTLY LESS THAN 1.8, 
WE PAID NOTHING. 
AND, YET -- AND YET, IT WAS A 
VERY SMART DEAL FOR NORTH 
KOREA, GOODWILL IS VERY 
IMPORTANT. 
BUT, WE SIGNED A WONDERFUL 
PAPER. 
WE SAID THEY ARE GOING TO 
DENUCLEARIZE THEIR WHOLE THING. 
IT IS ALL GOING TO HAPPEN. 
BUT, NOW -- YOU KNOW, WAS BACK 
IN SIX DAYS. 
WHY HASN'T IT STARTED? 
WHY? 
WELL, I MEAN -- THESE GUYS -- 
OBAMA WAS VERY CLOSE TO GOING 
TO WAR. YOU HAVE 30 MILLION 
PEOPLE IN SEOUL SOUTH KOREA. 
IT IS 30 MILES OFF THE BORDER. 
AND, THAT IS A TOUGH ORDER, 
THOUSANDS OF CANNONS THEY CALL 
THEM. 
THESE ARE BIG, BIG GUNS. 
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR. 
YOU COULD HAVE LOST 30-50 
MILLION PEOPLE, YOU COULD HAVE 
HAD A WAR LIKE YOU HAVE NOT HAD 
IN A LONG TIME. 
AND, GUESS WHAT YOU HAVE NOW? 
EIGHT MONTHS, NO NUCLEAR 
TESTING, NO MISSILES, NO 
ANYTHING. 
MIKE POMPEO  IS OVER THERE 
RIGHT NOW. 
 AND THEY SAY HE, 
MEANING ME, THESE GUYS -- THE 
CROOKED PRESS, THEY ARE SO 
DISHONEST -- THEY ARE SO -- 
FAKE NEWS. 
THEY ARE THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA. 
SO, WHAT DO THEY SAY ALL THE 
TIME? 
BECAUSE, THEY DID NOT GIVE 
ANYTHING UP. 
WHAT DID THEY SAY ALL THE TIME? 
THEY SAY HE WENT THERE. 
I WENT THERE. 
I WENT TO SINGAPORE. 
WE HAD A MEETING. 
BY AGREEING TO MEET, YOU KNOW 
-- THEY CANNOT COME UP WITH 
ANYTHING ELSE -- LIKE, I DID 
NOT GIVE LIKE CLINTON AND LIKE 
OBAMA WHAT HAVE -- YOU KNOW, 
OBAMA COULD NOT MEET. 
WELL, HE SAYS THAT OBAMA COULD 
NOT MEET -- THEY WOULD NOT SEE 
HIM. 
SO, I DID NOT HAVE LIKE CLINTON 
WHERE THEY HAVE BILLIONS AND 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, I GOT 
NOTHING. 
OKAY? 
SO, THEY COULD NOT FIND 
ANYTHING. 
SO, WHAT DO THEY DO? 
THEY SAY I MET, I MET -- THAT 
IS WHAT WE LOST, FOLKS. 
HE MET. 
NOW, BY THE WAY, OBAMA WOULD 
HAVE LOVED TO HAVE MET. 
THEY WOULD NOT SEE HIM, THEY 
WOULD NOT SEE HIM. 
ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS THAT 
I ASKED WHEN I WAS OVER THERE 
-- THEY WOULD NOT SEE HIM. 
SO, I MET, THAT IS HOW WE GOT 
BEAT AND NOW THEY SAY IT WITH 
VLADIMIR PUTIN, HE IS HIGHLY 
PREPARED, AND TRUMP -- WILL HE 
BE PREPARED FOR THE MEETING? 
TRUST ME, WE WILL DO JUST FINE. 
 FAKE NEWS, BAD 
PEOPLE. 
BAD PEOPLE. 
WILL HE BE PREPARED? 
AND, I MIGHT EVEN END UP HAVING 
A GOOD RELATIONSHIP, BUT 
THEY'RE GOING -- WILL PRESIDENT 
TRUMP BE PREPARED, YOU KNOW -- 
PRESIDENT PUTIN'S KGB, AND THIS 
AND THAT -- YOU KNOW WHAT? 
PUTIN IS FINE. 
HE IS FINE. 
WE ARE ALL FINE. 
WE ARE PEOPLE. 
WILL I BE PREPARED, TOTALLY 
PREPARED, I HAVE BEEN PREPARED 
FOR THE STUFF MY WHOLE LIFE, 
THEY DO NOT SAY -- DO NOT SAY 
THAT. 
 
>> AND YOU REALLY DO, TELL YOU 
WHAT -- BECAUSE I SEE IT, I SEE 
THE WAY THEY WRITE, THEY ARE SO 
DAMNED DISHONEST, AND I DON'T 
MEAN ALL OF THEM. 
BECAUSE, SOME OF THE FINEST 
PEOPLE I KNOW ARE JOURNALISTS, 
REALLY. 
HARD TO BELIEVE WHEN I SAID 
THAT. 
I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT I HAVE TO 
SAY -- BUT, 75% OF THOSE PEOPLE 
ARE DOWNRIGHT DISHONEST. 
THEY ARE FAKE. 
THEY ARE FAKE. 
THEY QUOTE SOURCES, A SOURCE 
WITHIN THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION 
SAID -- THEY DO NOT HAVE A 
SOURCE, THEY NEVER USE NAMES 
ANYMORE. 
YOU KNOW, IN THE OLD DAYS YOU 
HAD TO USE NAMES. 
THEY DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE. 
THEY SAY A SOURCE WITHIN THE 
ADMINISTRATION -- THEY MAKE THE 
SOURCES UP, THEY DON'T EXIST IN 
MANY CASES. 
HOW MANY TIMES -- MANY TIMES 
YOU WILL SAY -- 15 ANONYMOUS 
SOURCES, I DON'T HAVE 15 PEOPLE 
-- I MEAN, I FORGET IT. 
15 ANONYMOUS SOURCES HAVE SAID 
-- ALL SORTS OF STUFF. 
THESE ARE BAD PEOPLE. 
BUT, HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE -- 
WE ARE HERE, HOW DID WE GET 
HERE? 
REALLY? 
HOW DID WE --  HOW 
DID WE GET HERE? 
SO, IF YOU LOOK AT JOHN TESTER, 
HE SIGNED UP FOR THE DEMOCRATS 
RADICAL IMMIGRATION AGENDA, 
WHICH IS LET THEM COME IN, AND 
WE BELIEVED -- IN SANCTUARY 
CITIES, WHERE THEY HOUSE THE 
CRIMINALS. 
WE BELIEVE IN A STRONG ORDERS 
AND NO CRIME, IT IS VERY 
SIMPLE. 
STRONG ORDERS. 
WE BELIEVE IN COMING INTO THIS 
COUNTRY LEGALLY. 
WE BELIEVE IN --  
WE BELIEVE IN THE MERIT SYSTEM, 
SO WHEN YOU HAVE A BUSINESS, 
AND SOMEBODY COMES IN AND -- 
HONESTLY, I HATE TO TELL YOU 
THIS -- YOU HAVE TO GO WITH IT. 
WE WERE DOING SO WELL, SO MANY 
BUSINESSES ARE MOVING BACK TO 
THIS COUNTRY, SO MANY CAR 
COMPANIES ARE COMING BACK INTO 
MICHIGAN AND TO OHIO AND 
PENNSYLVANIA, AND TO NORTH AND 
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
WE NEED PEOPLE, WE DO NOT HAVE 
THE WORKERS ANYMORE. 
AND, BY THE WAY, THAT IS 
SOMETHING THAT IS UNIQUE. 
YOU HAVE NOT HEARD THAT FOR A 
LONG TIME. 
WAGES ARE GOING UP, RIGHT? 
BUT, WE NEED PEOPLE. 
BUT, WHO DO WE NEED? 
WE NEED PEOPLE THAT COME IN 
UNDER THE MERIT SYSTEM. 
UNDER THE MERIT SYSTEM. 
 A VOTE FOR THE 
DEMOCRAT FOR -- THAT IS A VOTE 
TO LET MS 13 RUN WILD IN OUR 
COMMUNITIES. 
TO LET DRUGS POUR INTO OUR 
CITIES. 
AND TO TAKE JOBS AND BENEFITS 
AWAY FROM OUR HARD-WORKING 
AMERICANS, AND WE ARE NOT 
LETTING THAT HAPPEN. 
DEMOCRATS WANT ANARCHY, THEY 
REALLY DO. 
AND, THEY DO NOT KNOW WHO THEY 
ARE PLAYING WITH, FOLKS. 
I SAID IT THE OTHER DAY, YES -- 
SHE HAS A LOW IQ, MAXINE 
WATERS, SAID IT THE OTHER DAY 
-- I MEAN, HONESTLY -- SHE IS 
SOMEWHERE IN THE MID-60s I 
BELIEVE. 
HE WILL BE IMPEACHED, I WILL BE 
IMPEACHED. 
EVEN THE DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING 
HOW ARE YOU SAYING THAT? 
BECAUSE, IT GETS THE NOT TO 
VOTE. 
HE SAYS STAY WITH MET BERT -- 
WORD. 
ESPECIALLY SINCE HE HAS DONE 
NOTHING WRONG. 
THAT ALSO DOESN'T HELP, RIGHT? 
NO COLLISION, NO COLLISION. 
AFTER SPENDING 22 MILLION, IT IS
AWFULLY TOUGH. 
CAN YOU IMAGINE? 
THIS IS AN EXCUSE FOR THE 
DEMOCRATS WHO LOST AN ELECTION 
AND GOT THEIR KICKED  --
>>> WE ARE GOING TO SPEND -- 
THEY ARE GOING TO SPEND LIKE 
$11 BILLION. 
IT WILL BE ABOUT A $15 BILLION 
PLAN. 
THERE WILL BE NOTHING LIKE IT 
IN THIS COUNTRY. 
BRIKLEY, OUTSIDE OF CHINA, 
THERE WILL BE NOTHING LIKE IT. 
I THE TIME IT IS FINISHED, IT 
WILL TOP ANYTHING IN CHINA. 
IT IS INCREDIBLE. 
BUT, $15 BILLION, 15,000 JOBS 
FOR WISCONSIN. 
THINK OF WISCONSIN. 
REAGAN HAD HIS BIG WIN. 
HE WON EVERY STATE EXCEPT ONE. 
I WON WISCONSIN. 
IT IS THE FIRST TIME SINCE 
DWIGHT EISENHOWER IN 1950. 
AND, WE WON MICHIGAN. 
AND WE WON PENNSYLVANIA, NORTH 
CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA AND 
FLORIDA. 
WE RAN UP THAT EAST COAST. 
YOU HAD TO RUN UP THAT EAST 
COAST, WINNING THE ELECTORAL 
COLLEGES. 
IT IS MUCH TOUGHER THAN THE SO 
CARD -- SO-CALLED POPULAR VOTE. 
WE HAD A GREAT VICTORY. 
NOT SINCE DWIGHT EISENHOWER IN 
1952 -- WAS THAT ONE OF THE 
GREAT EVENINGS?I 
ALWAYS SAY BECAUSE THE RATINGS 
THAT THEY ARE GETTING ARE 
BEYOND BELIEF. 
THE NEW YORK TIMES WAS READY TO 
FOLD. 
IT WAS GOING TO CLOSE AND THEN 
I CAME ALONG UNFORTUNATELY. 
ULTIMATELY, WHEN I LEAVE IN 
SEVEN YEARS FROM NOW THEY WILL 
FOLD. 
THEY WILL FOLD. 
WHEN YOU SEE THE TIMES, HOW 
DISHONEST THEY ARE, WHEN WE 
LEAVE.
I SAY THIS. 
THEY ARE ALL DOING NUMBERS THAT 
THEY HAVE NEVER DONE. 
WHEN I ANNOUNCE THEY'RE GOING 
TO ENDORSE ME. 
SHOULD I LOSE OR IF I DON'T 
RUN, THEY ARE OUT OF BUSINESS. 
THEY ARE GOING TO COVER BERNIE? 
THEY'RE GOING TO COVER SLEEPY 
JOE BIDEN? 
THEY'RE GOING TO COVER 
POCAHONTAS? THINK ABOUT IT. 
SHE, OF THE GREAT TRIBAL 
HERITAGE. 
WHAT TRIBE IS IT? 
LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT ONE. 
IN THE MEANTIME, SHE HAS BASED 
HER LIFE ON BEING A MINORITY. 
POCAHONTAS, THEY ALWAYS WANT ME 
TO APOLOGIZE FOR SAYING IT. 
I HEREBY -- I WANT TO 
APOLOGIZE. 
I WILL USE TONIGHT, POCAHONTAS, 
I APOLOGIZE TO YOU. 
I APOLOGIZE. 
TO YOU, I APOLOGIZE. 
TO THE FAKE POCAHONTAS, I WON'T 
APOLOGIZE. 
IT IS CAUSING A PROBLEM. 
NOW, EVEN THE LIBERALS ARE 
SAYING TAKE A TEST. 
I SHOULD NOT TELL YOU BECAUSE I 
LIKE NOT TO GIVE AWAY SECRETS. 
LET'S SAY I AM DEBATING 
POCAHONTAS. 
I PROMISE YOU I WILL DO THIS. 
YOU KNOW THOSE LITTLE KITTENS 
THEY SELL ON TELEVISION FOR TWO 
DOLLARS? 
LEARN YOUR HERITAGE. 
THIS GUY SAYS I WAS BORN IN 
SCOTLAND BUT IT TURNS OUT HE 
WAS BORN IN PUERTO RICO. 
THAT IS OKAY. 
A GUY SAYS HE WAS BORN IN 
GERMANY BUT HE WAS BORN 
SOMEPLACE ELSE. 
I WILL GET ONE OF THOSE LITTLE 
KITS. 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DEBATE, 
WHEN SHE PROCLAIMS THAT SHE IS 
OF INDIAN HERITAGE BECAUSE HER 
MOTHER SAID SHE HAS HIGH 
CHEEKBONES, THAT IS HER ONLY 
EVIDENCE, WE WILL TAKE THAT 
LITTLE KIT AND SAY WE HAVE TO 
DO IT GENTLY. 
WHEN THE ME TOO GENERATION -- 
WE HAVE TO BE VERY GENTLE. 
WE WILL VERY GENTLY TAKE THAT 
KIT AND WE WILL SLOWLY TOSS IT, 
HOPING IT DOES NOT HIT HER AND 
INJURE HER ARM, EVEN THOUGH IT 
ONLY WEIGHS TWO OUNCES. 
WE WILL SAY "I WILL GIVE YOU $1 
MILLION FOR YOUR FAVORITE 
CHARITY PAID FOR BY TRUMP IF 
YOU TAKE THE TEST AND IT SHOWS 
YOU ARE AN INDIAN."
LET'S SEE WHAT SHE 
DOES. 
I HAVE A FEELING SHE WILL SAY NO
BUT WE WILL HOLD THAT FOR THE 
DEBATE. 
KEEP IT WITHIN THIS ROOM. I 
DON'T WANT TO GIVE AWAY ANY 
SECRETS. 
THE PRESS IS VERY HONORABLE. 
PLEASE DON'T TELL HER WHAT I 
JUST SAID. 
DEMOCRATS ARE LAUNCHING 
OUTRAGEOUS ATTACKS AGAINST OUR 
INCREDIBLE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND 
OUR I.C.E. 
AND BORDER PATROL. 
THEIR NEW PLATFORM FOR THE 
DEMOCRAT PARTY -- BY THE WAY, I 
CALL IT THE DEMOCRAT PARTY. 
IT SOUNDS THAT ARE. 
I WROTE BEST SELLERS. 
I GUESS I SPEAK WELL. úWE TURNE 
PEOPLE. 
THEY NEVER SAY I AM A GREAT 
SPEAKER. 
WHY THE HELL DO SO MANY PEOPLE 
COME? 
WHY DO THEY COME? 
WHY? 
WHY DO THEY COME? 
IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING. 
I GUESS THEY LIKE MY POLICY. 
MAYBE YOU LIKE POLICY. 
HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED -- YOU 
NEVER HEAR THAT. 
THERE HAS GOT TO BE A REASON. 
I HAVE BROKEN MORE ELTON JOHN 
RECORDS. 
HE SEEMS TO HAVE A LOT OF 
RECORDS. 
I DON'T HAVE A MUSICAL 
INSTRUMENT. 
I DON'T HAVE A GUITAR. WE BROKE 
A LOT OF RECORDS. 
WE HAVE BROKEN VIRTUALLY EVERY 
RECORD. 
I ONLY NEED THIS FACE. 
THEY NEED MUCH MORE ROOM FOR 
BASKETBALL, FOR HOCKEY, THEY 
NEED A LOT OF ROOM. 
WE DON'T NEED IT. 
WE BREAK ALL OF THESE RECORDS. 
REALLY, WE DO IT WITHOUT THE 
MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS. 
THIS IS THE ONLY MUSICAL -- THE 
MOUTH. 
AND, HOPEFULLY THE BRAIN 
ATTACHED TO THE MOUTH. 
THE BRAIN IS MORE IMPORTANT 
THAN THE MOUTH. 
THE BRAIN IS MUCH MORE 
IMPORTANT. 
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD -- THEY SAY 
WE HAD A CASE LAST WEEK. 
WE WERE IN A GREAT PLACE IN 
WISCONSIN. 
WE HAD A TREMENDOUS CROWD. 
WE HAD A 22,000 SEAT ARENA. 
IN RETROSPECT, WE WOULD HAVE 
ACTED AND THEY WOULD HAVE SENT 
AWAY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE BUT 
THE VERY INNOCENT PEOPLE SAID 
TO ME -- THEY FILLED UP A 7000 
SEAT ARENA AND WALKED AWAY 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. WE WOULD 
HAVE FILLED. 
I ASKED WHY THEY DID NOT USE 
THE BIG ARENA AND THEY SAID WE 
KNEW IF YOU HAD FIVE VACANT 
SEATS, THEY WOULD SAY DONALD 
TRUMP WAS UNABLE TO FILL THE 
ARENA. 
I SAID YOU ARE RIGHT. 
HOW ABOUT THE ONE FROM THE 
WASHINGTON POST? 
THEY GOT THERE FOUR HOURS EARLY 
AND THE ARENA HAD NOT STARTED 
EVEN LETTING PEOPLE IN. 
THERE WERE JUST A FEW PEOPLE. 
YOU ALL SAW THE STORY I HOPE. 
THEY GOT THERE FOUR HOURS 
EARLY. 
THIS WRITER DID NOT GET FIRED. 
HE SAID DONALD TRUMP HAD AN 
EMPTY ARENA. EXCEPT, WHEN I 
SHOWED UP, THE PLACE WAS PACKED 
AND THEY HAD TO WALK AWAY 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. 
I DID NOT SEE THIS STORY. 
YOU KNOW WHO SAW THIS STORY? 
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE 
ARENA. 
THEY WENT NUTS. THEY APOLOGIZED.
YOU KNOW WHAT? 
THEY APOLOGIZED ON TWITTER. 
THEY HAD TO SAY DONALD TRUMP 
DID NOT HAVE A VERY GOOD CROWD 
AND THEY SHOW A VERY EMPTY 
ARENA. 
BY THE WAY, I HATE TO SAY IT, 
TAKE A LOOK AT THE PICTURES FOR 
THE INAUGURATION. 
WE HAD SOME MONSTER CROWD. 
A BIG MONSTER. 
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. 
THEY SHOW AN ARENA BEFORE THE 
PEOPLE STARTED COMING IN. 
THERE WERE A FEW PEOPLE. 
THEY APOLOGIZED. LET ME JUST 
TELL YOU, THE DEMOCRATS, WE 
CALL THEM THE DEMOCRAT PARTY 
BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
SOUNDS TOO GOOD. 
I ALWAYS SAY THE DEMOCRAT PARTY 
AND PEOPLE TELL ME I MADE A 
MISTAKE. 
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SOUNDS TOO 
GOOD SO I DON'T WANT TO USE IT. 
THE NEW PLATFORM OF THE 
DEMOCRAT PARTY IS TO ABOLISH 
I.C.E.
. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY WANT TO 
ABOLISH IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT 
ENTIRELY. 
THAT IS WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. 
THEY WANT EVERYBODY COMING IN. 
THE BEAUTY WITH I.C.E. 
IS THEY ARE SO TOUGH. 
WHEN YOU HAVE THESE MS-13 THUGS 
COME IN, I.C.E. 
COMES IN AND WIPES THEM OUT 
LIKE NOTHING. 
THEY ARE MUCH TOUGHER. 
THEY WIPE THEM OUT. 
DELIBERATE TOWNS ON LONG ISLAND 
AND OTHER PLACES. 
IT IS LIKE A NATION IS 
OCCUPYING YOUR COUNTRY. 
WE ARE TAKING THEM OUT BY THE 
ú 
IF IT WEREN'T FOR I.C.E.
, WE WOULD NOT BE DOING IT. 
THESE ARE SAVAGE GANGS. 
WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THESE 
VILE DEMOCRATS FEARS AGAINST 
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THAT 
INCLUDES OUR GREAT POLICE. 
THAT INCLUDES OUR GREAT BORDER 
PATROL. 
THAT INCLUDES OUR MILITARY WITH 
THEY ARE -- MILITARY WHERE THEY 
ARE ALWAYS FIGHTING AGAINST 
FUNDING. 
WE WILL ALWAYS STAND BY PROUDLY 
THE HEROES. 
THERE ARE HEROES ON LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AND IN OUR MILITARY.
EVERY DAY I AM PRESIDENT, WE 
ILL TRACK DOWN THE  
MEMBERS, DRUG DEALERS, CHILD 
PREDATORS, AND CRIMINAL ALIENS 
THAT WE FIND. 
WE WILL GET THEM AND THROW THEM 
THE HELL OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. 
WE WILL PUT THEM IN JAIL. 
THIS YEAR, IN NOVEMBER, IF YOU 
WANT TO SAVE I.C.E. 
AND IF YOU WANT TO SAVE YOUR 
LAW ENFORCEMENT, IF YOU WANT TO 
SAVE YOUR MILITARY, GETTING 
MILITARY FUNDING -- WE HAVE 
$700 BILLION. 
NEXT YEAR WILL BE BIGGER. 
WE SAVED OUR MILITARY. 
GETTING MILITARY FUNDING FROM 
THESE DEMOCRATS IS ALMOST 
IMPOSSIBLE. 
THEY DON'T WANT IT. 
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT OUR 
MILITARY. 
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT OUR LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
THEY COULD NOT GIVE A DAMN. 
YOU BETTER VOTE REPUBLICAN. 
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICANS. 
IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT YOUR 
FAMILY AND YOUR COMMUNITY, THEN 
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE. 
YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR 
REPUBLICANS. 
IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A COUNTRY, 
IF YOU WANT BORDERS. 
WOULDN'T IT BE NICE TO HAVE 
BORDERS? 
HOW ABOUT BORDERS? 
>> BUILD THAT WALL! 
BUILD THAT WALL! 
BUILD THAT WALL! 
BUILD THAT WALL! 
BUILD THAT WALL! 
>> YES, WE ARE ALREADY BUILDING 
THE WALL. 
IT STARTED IN SAN DIEGO, 
CALIFORNIA. 
WE ARE ASKING FOR $5 BILLION. I 
WILL TELL YOU WHAT, IT IS 
BRUTAL WITH THESE PEOPLE. 
THEY DON'T WANT IT. 
THEY KNOW IT IS THE RIGHT THING 
TO DO BUT THEY THINK IT WILL 
HELP ME. 
IT IS NOT EVEN THE REPUBLICANS. 
IF WE DO IT, IT IS GOOD FOR 
TRUMP. 
LET'S NOT DO IT. 
EVERY DAY WE ARE KEEPING OUR 
PROMISES. WE HAVE CREATED 3.4 
MILLION JOBS SINCE ELECTION DAY 
WHICH NOBODY CAN EVEN BELIEVE. 
NOBODY CAN BELIEVE IT. 
NOBODY BELIEVES IT. 
I ALWAYS SAY IF I WOULD HAVE 
SAID THAT ON THE CAMPAIGN 
TRAIL, WHEN I WAS HERE OR 
ANYPLACE ELSE, IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN BRUTAL. 
THEY WOULD HAVE SAID HOW CAN 
YOU POSSIBLY SAY ANYTHING LIKE 
THAT? 
3.4 MILLION NEW JOBS, 
UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS ARE AT A 45 
YEAR LOW. 
AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC 
AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE 
REACHED THE LOWEST LEVELS IN 
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
REMEMBER, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO 
LOSE? 
PEOPLE DID NOT LIKE IT WHEN I 
SAID THAT. 
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE? 
WE ARE RIGHT. 
A NEW POLL CAME OUT LAST WEEK. 
WE WERE UP IN A WEEK, 10 POINTS 
WITH THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY. 
THEY WANT TO BE SAFE. 
UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG WOMEN IS AT 
THE LOWEST LEVEL IT HAS BEEN IN 
THE 65 YEARS AND WITHIN A 
COUPLE OF WEEKS HISTORY. 
OUR ECONOMIC POLICY CAN BE 
SUMMED UP IN THREE VERY SIMPLE 
BUT BEAUTIFUL WORDS, JOBS, 
JOBS, JOBS. 
SINCE THE ELECTION, WE HAVE 
LIFTED 3 MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF 
FOOD STAMPS. 
BY THE WAY, ON A HUMANITARIAN 
BASIS, THAT IS A GREAT THING. 
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY WE 
SAVED BY DOING THAT AS A 
COUNTRY? 
3 MILLION PEOPLE AND IT IS 
GOING UP FAST. 
WAGES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 18 
YEARS ARE RISING AGAIN. 
PEOPLE CAN GO OUT. 
THEY CAN ACTUALLY CHOOSE A JOB 
AND THEY HAVE WAGES THAT ARE 
RISING. 
SIX MONTHS AGO, REPUBLICANS 
PASSED THE BIGGEST TAX CUTS IN 
AMERICAN HISTORY, THE BIGGEST 
IN AMERICAN HISTORY. EVERYBODY 
IN THIS ROOM IS BETTER. 
EVERYBODY IS BETTER FOR IT. 
WE SLASHED TAXES FOR WORKING 
FAMILIES AND SAVED OUR FAMILY 
FARMS. 
WE SAVED FAMILY FARMS. 
AS A RESULT OF OUR TAX CUTS, 
$300 BILLION POURED BACK INTO 
THE UNITED STATES JUST IN THE 
FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR ALONE
. WE HAVE A LOT MORE THAN THAT, 
$300 BILLION CAME BACK. 
THAT IS MONEY THAT WOULD HAVE 
NEVER BEEN ABLE TO COME BACK 
INTO OUR COUNTRY. 
APPLE COMPUTER IS SPENDING $350 
BILLION ON NEW CAMPUSES ON NEW 
FACILITIES. 
THEY ARE BRINGING BACK $350 
BILLION. 
THEY ARE PUTTING UP THEIR OWN 
MONEY. 
THEY WILL HAVE -- THEY WILL BE 
SUBJECT TO THE TAX CODE, $230 
BILLION COME BACK. 
95% OF U.S. MANUFACTURERS ARE 
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE. 
THAT IS THE HIGHEST NUMBER EVER.
THINK ABOUT IT, 95% OF ANYTHING.
YOU DON'T HEAR THAT. 
WE ALSO REPEALED, DESPITE THE 
THUMBS DOWN AT 2 AM, WE ALSO 
REPEALED THE MOST HORRIBLE 
ASPECT OF THE FAILED OBAMACARE 
HEALTHCARE. IT IS CALLED THE 
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. 
IT IS GONE. 
IT IS GONE. 
GONE. 
IT IS GONE. 
THAT WAS WHERE YOU HAD TO PAY A 
LOT OF MONEY FOR THE PRIVILEGE 
OF NOT HAVING TO PAY FOR BAD 
HEALTHCARE. 
ONE OF THE TRULY RIPOFFS. 
WE GOT RID OF IT. 
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE YOU PAYING 
NOT TO HAVE IT? 
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE PAID NOT TO 
HAVE HEALTHCARE. 
THAT DOES NOT WORK. 
WE ARE ALLOWING BUSINESSES TO 
JOIN FORCES, TO BUY BETTER 
HEALTHCARE FOR LESS MONEY 
THROUGH ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS
THAT JUST CAME OUT TWO WEEKS 
AGO. 
THEY CROSSED STATE LINES. 
THEY WERE ALLOWED TO CROSS 
STATE LINES. 
YOU WILL GET VERY LOW PRICES. 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE ALREADY 
SIGNING UP. 
AFTER DECADES OF WAITING, WE 
OPENED ENERGY DEPARTMENT IN 
ALASKA. 
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET 
THAT APPROVED FOR 40 YEARS. 
WE HAVE ELIMINATED RECORD 
NUMBERS OF JOB KILLING 
REGULATIONS. 
WE HAVE STOPPED COLD THE 
ASSAULT ON OUR FARMERS, OUR 
RANCHERS, OUR ENERGY PRODUCERS 
AND OUR GREAT END LOVING MINORS.
-- MINERS.  
WE PUT OUR MINERS BACK TO WORK 
WITH CLEAN COAL . WE ARE 
PROUDLY AND STRONGLY PROTECTING 
OUR PUBLIC LANDS FOR FUTURE 
GENERATIONS. 
YOU SEE IT ALL OVER. 
YOU SEE WHAT WE ARE DOING. 
YOU CAN SEE LEGISLATION. 
WE APPROVED THE KEYSTONE AND 
THE DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINES 
RIGHT AWAY, 48,000 JOBS. 
48,000 JOBS. WE WITHDREW FROM 
THE JOB KILLING PARIS CLIMATE 
ACCORD. 
IT IS ONE OF THE MOST UNFAIR 
úD 
I KNEW I WOULD GET KILLED WHEN 
I SIGNED OFF ON IT. 
IT SOUNDS SO PRETTY, THE PARIS 
CLIMATE. 
WHO WOULD NOT DO THAT? 
IT IS HORRIBLE FOR US BUT GREAT 
FOR OTHER COUNTRIES. 
WE TOOK HISTORIC ACTION TO 
SAFEGUARD YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL 
FREEDOMS, PROTECTING RELIGIOUS 
LIBERTY DEFENDING THE SECOND 
AMENDMENT AND CONFIRMING A 
RECORD NUMBER OF CIRCUIT COURT 
JUDGES. 
WE ARE BRINGING BACK OUR WEALTH 
FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 
YOU KNOW THIS. 
WE ARE BRINGING BACK OUR WEALTH 
FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT 
HAVE BEEN RIPPING US OFF FOR 
YEARS. 
FOR TOO LONG, WE WATCHED AND WE 
WAITED AND WE SAW AS OTHER 
COUNTRIES STOLE OUR JOBS, 
CHEATED OUR WORKERS AND GUTTED 
OUR INDUSTRY. 
LOOK AT ALL THE PLACES HERE AND 
HERE. 
IF YOU LOOK AT SOME PLACES AND 
YOU GO UP TO NEW ENGLAND, YOU 
CAN STILL SEE THE REMNANTS 
WHERE THEY MOVED DOWN TO MEXICO 
UNDER NAFTA. 
IT IS ONE OF THE WORST DEALS. 
WE ARE NEGOTIATING. 
I HAVE A FEELING THEY WILL COME 
ALONG. 
IF THEY DON'T, WE WILL DO 
BETTER. 
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
WAS THE PIGGY BANK THAT 
EVERYBODY WAS ROBBING. 
OUR ALLIES IN MANY CASES WERE 
WORSE THAN OUR ENEMIES. 
WE OPENED OUR COUNTRY TO THEIR 
GOODS BUT THEY PUT UP MASSIVE 
BARRIERS TO KEEP OUR PRODUCTS 
AND OUR GOODS THE HELL OUT OF 
OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY DID 
NOT WANT THAT INVITATION. 
-- COMPETITION. 
THAT IS NOT FREE-TRADE, THAT IS 
STUPID TRADE. 
WE DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE. 
WE HAVE TO HAVE FAIR AND 
RECIPROCAL. WE NEED RECIPROCAL. 
THEY CHARGE A 50% TAX, WE 
CHARGE A 50% TAX. 
THEN WE SAY LET'S BRING IT TO 
NOTHING OR I DON'T CARE. 
IT IS INCREDIBLE. 
WE HAVE COUNTRIES RIPPING US UP 
FOR YEARS. 
THEY SAY WE ARE GOING TO PUT 
TARIFFS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN 
RIPPING US. 
WE HAVE TRADE DEFICITS, 
SURPLUSES. 
THEY HAVE ALL OF THIS. 
THEY SAY WE ARE GOING TO DO 
SOMETHING ABOUT IT. 
SOME POLITICIANS SAY IT IS 
TERRIBLE. 
>> I SAY WE ARE GOING TO MAKE 
GREAT DEALS. 
THEY WANT ME TO LEAVE IT THE 
WAY IT IS BUT I SAY NO. 
WE HAVE ALL THE CARDS. 
WE ARE THE BANK THAT EVERYONE 
IS STEALING FROM. 
YOU SAW WITH CHINA, $50 BILLION 
AND ANOTHER $200 BILLION IS 
WAITING. 
NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN THIS 
BEFORE. 
CHINA -- YOU HAVE TO RESPECT 
THEM AND ADMIRE THEM. 
THEY WILL SAY DONALD TRUMP 
LOVES CHINA. HE LOVES CHINA 
MORE THAN HE LOVES THE UNITED 
STATES. 
THESE PEOPLE. 
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU 
SAY. 
IF I SAY THAT, -- I DO. 
I RESPECT CHINA. 
THEY HAVE BEEN KILLING US, $507 
BILLION IN TRADE DEFICITS LAST 
YEAR. 
WHO THE HELL CAN LOSE THAT 
MUCH? 
THEN YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING 
ABOUT IT AND YOU GET ATTACKED. 
THAT IS NOT NICE. 
THAT IS NOT FREE-TRADE. 
THE WAR WAS LOST ON TRADE MANY 
YEARS AGO. 
THE WAR WAS LOST BUT NOW WE 
WILL WIN IT. 
WE HAVE ALL THE CARS -- CARDS. 
>> IT IS ALWAYS HELPFUL IF YOU 
DON'T HAVE THE LITTLE ONES 
GAPING AT YOUR HEELS. 
IT IS EASY TO NEGOTIATE WHEN 
YOU HAVE SUPPORT. YOU DON'T 
HAVE SOME SENATOR THAT WAS 
FORCED OUT OF OFFICE BECAUSE HE 
DID NOT LIKE ME SAYING BAD 
THINGS LIKE WE SHOULD NOT BE 
DOING THAT. 
WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING THAT 
AGAINST SO-AND-SO. 
WE ARE IN SUCH A GREAT POSITION.
OTHER COUNTRIES ARE CALLING US. 
DID YOU KNOW THAT IF WE 
KNOCKDOWN THE TRADE DEFICIT BY 
JUST A LITTLE BIT, 25%, WE PICK 
UP ONE POINT IN GDP. 
DOES ANYBODY KNOW THAT? 
THAT IS $3 TRILLION AND THAT IS 
10 MILLION JOBS. 
THAT IS JUST 25%. 
WE PICK UP ONE POINT. 
SPEAKING OF GDP, REMEMBER WHEN 
I WOULD SAY IT WAS GOING TO GO 
TO 3% PRETTY QUICKLY? 
NOW, THE ATLANTA FEDS JUST 
PREDICTED 4.8%. WHO KNOWS? I 
CAN ONLY TELL YOU THAT IT WILL 
BE A LOT BETTER THAN YOU HAD 
WITH OBAMA. 
IF THESE PEOPLE GET ELECTED, 
YOU WOULD HAVE GONE DOWN LIKE 
YOU NEVER SAW ANYTHING GO DOWN. 
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN THE 
REGULATIONS OFF. 
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN THE 
TAX CUTS. 
YOU WOULD HAVE HAD AN ECONOMY 
THAT WAS GOING TO CRASH AND 
BURN. 
IT WAS READY. 
NOW WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS A 
ROCKETSHIP. 
EVERY TIME I MEET A LEADER OF 
ANOTHER COUNTRY, WHICH IS 
OFTEN, THEY ALWAYS START BY 
SAYING "I WOULD LIKE TO 
CONGRATULATE YOU ON THE 
INCREDIBLE JOB YOU HAVE DONE 
WITH THE UNITED STATES." 
JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, EVERY TIME, 
THEY WANT TO CONGRATULATE ME. 
OTHERS ARE STUDYING WHAT WE 
HAVE DONE. 
THEY ARE STUDYING WHAT WE HAVE 
DONE. 
WE HAVE THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN 
THE WORLD. 
THOSE BEAUTIFUL HATS MAKE 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
SOON TO BE CHANGED TO "KEEP 
AMERICA GREAT." KEEP AMERICA 
GREAT! 
SOON TO BE CHANGED. 
I CAN'T USE MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN FOR THE SECOND RUN. 
THEY SAID WHY THE HELL DID YOU 
DO IT THE FIRST TIME? 
IT IS CALLED KEEP AMERICA 
GREAT. 
WHAT WE ARE DOING IS 
INCREDIBLE. 
IT IS INCREDIBLE. 
WE HAVE CREATED -- SINCE THE 
ELECTION, WE HAVE CREATED IN 
WEALTH $7 TRILLION. WITH THE 
FASTEST GROWING NATION ON AN 
ECONOMY BASIS, MAYBE IT DOES 
FOR THE BIG NATIONS. 
I HEARD THE NATION WITH THE 
FASTEST GROWING ECONOMIC NATION 
IN THE WORLD. 
THINK OF THAT. 
I ADD THE BIG NATION BECAUSE 
THEY ARE PROBABLY BACK AT IT. 
WE ARE ONE OF THE FASTEST. 
I THINK WE ARE THE FASTEST 
GROWING AND WE ARE CERTAINLY 
GROWING OUR MILITARY. 
WE ARE TAKING CARE OF OUR 
VETERANS MORE THAN ANYONE EVER 
HAS. 
THANKS TO REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP,
AMERICANS WINNING AGAIN -- 
AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN. 
AMERICA IS BEING RESPECTED 
AGAIN ALL OVER THE WORLD. 
SOMEBODY SAID COULD YOU TELL 
THE WINNING STORY BACKSTAGE? I 
SAID I HAVE HEARD IT BUT STEVE 
DAYS, A GREAT SENATOR. 
HE COMES UP TO ME AND I SAY HI 
STEVE. 
HE SAID SIR, THE PEOPLE OF 
MONTANA ARE REALLY TIRED. 
THEY CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. 
THEY SAY WE HAVE TO SLOW IT 
DOWN. 
I SAY STEVE, GO BACK TO THE 
PEOPLE. 
GO BACK TO THE PEOPLE AND SAY I 
AM SORRY, I CANNOT HONOR THAT 
REQUEST. 
WE ARE GOING TO WIN AND WIN. 
WE ARE GOING TO WIN MORE LIKE 
WE HAVE NEVER WON BEFORE. 
WE ARE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA 
FIRST. 
WE ARE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. 
BY THE WAY, WHAT DID IT MEAN 
WHEN SOMEONE SAID THOUSAND 
POINTS OF LIGHT? 
I KNOW ONE THING, MAKE AMERICA 
GREAT AGAIN, WE UNDERSTAND. 
PUTTING AMERICA FIRST, WE 
UNDERSTAND. 
THOUSAND POINTS OF LIGHT, I 
NEVER QUITE GOT THAT ONE. 
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? 
HAS ANYONE EVER FIGURED OUT 
WHAT THAT IS? 
WE ARE INDEED DOING THINGS FOR 
THE COUNTRY LIKE NOBODY 
BELIEVED POSSIBLE. 
WE ARE REBUILDING OUR ECONOMY. 
FOR THE SAME THING, WE ARE 
RESTORING OUR SECURITY. 
WE HAVE PEOPLE FLOODING OUR 
BORDERS LIKE THEY HAVE NOT 
FLOODED EVER BEFORE. 
THEY ARE DOING AN INCREDIBLE 
JOB. 
PEOPLE WANT A PIECE OF OUR 
ACTION. 
THEY WANT TO COME INTO OUR 
ECONOMY. 
THEY WANT TO COME IN. 
THE PROBLEM IS, YOU HAVE TO 
COME IN LEGALLY. 
ALL OF THAT MONEY THAT WE HAVE 
SECURED FOR OUR MILITARY, ALL 
OF THAT, I HAVE DIRECTED TO 
PENTAGON TO BEGIN A PROCESS OF 
CREATING A SIX THE BRANCH OF 
THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES 
CALLED THE SPACE FORCE. YOU 
HAVE THE AIR FORCE, YOU WILL 
HAVE THE SPACE FORCE. 
PEOPLE ARE SO EXCITED BY THAT. 
IT IS NOT JUST SENDING ROCKETS 
TO THE MOON. 
THIS IS ALSO A MILITARY 
IMPERATIVE. 
IN FACT, IN RUSSIA, THEY SAID 
THEY CONSIDER IT VERY 
THREATENING AND OTHERS DID TOO. 
I AM SORRY. 
IF IT IS A PART OF THE AIR 
FORCE, THE AIR FORCE WILL FOCUS 
ON THE AIR FORCE BUT WE NEED A 
SEPARATE BRANCH. 
WE ARE WORKING ON THAT. 
IT IS CALLED THE SPACE FORCE. 
IT IS VERY EXCITING. 
PEOPLE LOVE IT. 
THEY GET TO ATTEND THEY LOVE 
IT. 
WE PASSED A LANDMARK VA 
ACCOUNTABILITY LAW THAT 
EVERYBODY SAID COULD NOT BE 
PASSED. 
I WON'T BLAME THE UNIONS AND I 
WON'T BLAME CIVIL SERVICE BUT 
LET'S ASSUME THEY HAD A LITTLE 
BLAME. 
EVERYONE SAID IT COULD NOT BE 
PASSED. 
WE JUST GOT IT PAST. 
THE VA ACCOUNTABILITY. 
NOW, YOU CAN FIRE PEOPLE WHEN 
THEY DON'T DO A JOB. 
YOUR FIRED! 
YOU GET THEM THE HELL OUT. 
THEY ARE NOT TAKING CARE OF OUR 
VETS, WE WILL FIRE THEM. 
THEY ARE OUT OF THEIR! 
-- THEIR EXPERT -- THERE X -- 
THEY ARE OUT OF THERE! 
THE OTHER THING WE PASSED A FEW 
WEEKS AGO, AND YOU HAVE HEARD 
ME TALK ABOUT THIS, OUR úVETERA 
PEOPLE. 
THEY HAVE PROTECTED US. 
SOME OF THEM HAVE SUFFERED 
GREATLY. 
WE WERE NOT TAKING PROPER CARE 
OF THEM. 
THEY WERE WAITING IN LINE FOR 
12 DAYS. 
ANYBODY IN THIS AUDIENCE, GO TO 
THE DOCTOR. IF THEY TELL YOU 
THEY CANNOT SEE YOU FOR 12 DAYS
, THAT ONE FLY. 
PEOPLE WERE GOING IN WITH 
NOTHING MUCH AND THEY WERE 
COMING OUT WITH A TERMINAL 
ILLNESS. 
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CORRECTED 
EASILY. 
I SAID WHY AREN'T WE JUST 
SENDING PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO WAIT
TO THESE LONG PERIODS, SEND 
THEM ACROSS THE STREET TO A 
LOCAL DOCTOR. 
WE WILL PAY THE BILL. 
EVERYBODY SAID WE HAVE BEEN 
TRYING TO GET THAT PASSED FOR 
40 YEARS. 
I GOT IT PAST THREE WEEKS AGO. 
I AM GOOD AT GETTING THINGS 
PASSED. 
REMEMBER, WE HAD REPEAL AND 
REPLACE PAST EXCEPT FOR ONE 
PERSON AND ALL OF THE DEMOCRATS.
ONE PERSON PLUS ALL OF THE 
DEMOCRATS. 
WE HAD NO DEMOCRATS. 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS A 
GREAT MAN. 
HE IS A GREAT MAN. 
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT AMERICAN 
FOREIGN AID DOLLARS SHOULD 
PROMOTE AMERICA'S INTEREST AND 
VALUES. 
WE DON'T NEED TO SEND YOUR HARD 
EARNED MONEY TO COUNTRIES THAT 
VOTE AGAINST THE UNITED STATES 
CONSISTENTLY IN THE UNITED 
NATIONS AND OTHER PLACES. 
WE DON'T NEED TO DO IT. 
REMEMBER WITH ISRAEL? REMEMBER 
WHEN WE HAD TWO VOTES ON 
SOMETHING HASN'T -- SOMETHING 
HAVING TO DO WITH ISRAEL. 
WE GIVE ALL OF THE AID TO THESE 
COUNTRIES AND WE ARE WATCHING. 
WE ENDED UP GETTING 68 VOTES. 
WE DID NOT DO ANYTHING. 
THEY ARE RIPPING US. 
THEY ARE TAKING OUR MONEY. 
THEY DON'T EVEN VOTE FOR US 
BECAUSE THEY DID NOT RESPECT 
OUR COUNTRY BUT NOW THEY ARE 
RESPECTING A LOT MORE. 
IN MANY CASES, THEY ARE NOT 
GETTING THAT MONEY ANYMORE. 
WE HAVE STOPPED IT. 
INSTEAD OF APOLOGIZING, WE ARE 
STANDING UP FOR AMERICA AND WE 
ARE STANDING UP FOR OUR GREAT 
AMERICAN FLAG. HOW ABOUT THE 
NFL? 
I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE 
CONTROVERSY. 
I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE 
CONTROVERSY BUT THEY PAST THIS 
STUPID THING. 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS 
ANYMORE. 
IF YOU DON'T RESPECT THE FLAG 
OR IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE 
COUNTRY OR WHATEVER IT IS, JUST 
GO INTO THE LOCKER ROOM. 
I THINK IN MANY RESPECTS, THAT 
IS WORSE. ISN'T THAT WORSE THAN 
NOT STANDING? 
I THINK THAT IS WORSE. 
THEY SAY GO INTO THE LOCKER 
ROOM. 
IT IS OKAY. 
THE ANTHEM IS GETTING READY TO 
PLAY, THEY RUN INTO THE LOCKER 
ROOM AND THEN THEY COME BACK 
OUT. 
THAT DOES NOT PLAY. 
I ACTUALLY THINK IN MANY WAYS, 
IT IS WORSE. 
I HEARD THIS THING THAT THE 
OWNERS WERE SO HAPPY. 
WHERE THIS COMMISSIONER COMES 
FROM, I HAVE NO IDEA. 
THEY ARE PAYING HIM $40 MILLION 
A YEAR AND THE RATINGS ARE DOWN 
20%. 
YOU KNOW WHY THEIR RATINGS ARE 
DOWN? 
YES, THE FLAG BUT THEY ARE ALSO 
DOWN BECAUSE PEOPLE FIND 
POLITICS TO BE MUCH TOUGHER AND 
MORE INTERESTING THAN WATCHING 
A FOOTBALL GAME. 
THEY ARE WATCHING THE CABLE 
NETWORKS INSTEAD OF WATCHING 
FOOTBALL. 
THEY ARE DOWN 20% SINCE THIS 
WHOLE THING STARTED WITH THE 
FLAG IN THE ANTHEM. 
WASHINGTON TRIED TO CHANGE US 
BUT INSTEAD, WE ARE CHANGING 
WASHINGTON. 
WE HAVE HAD A BIG IMPACT. 
NOW, WE NEED MATT ROSENDALE IN 
THE SENATE TO CONTINUE OUR FIGHT
, TO DRAIN THE SWAMP. WE ARE 
GOING TO GET IT DONE. 
WE NEED TO WORK EVERY DAY FROM 
NOW UNTIL THE ELECTION FOR YOUR 
FAMILY, FOR YOUR COMMUNITY, FOR 
YOUR COUNTRY, FOR YOUR 
CONSTITUTION. 
THIS NOVEMBER, I NEED YOU TO 
GET YOUR FRIENDS, GET YOUR 
COLLEAGUES, GET YOUR NEIGHBORS 
AND GET YOUR  OUT TO 
VOTE.  
IS THAT OKAY? 
GET YOUR  OUT TO VOTE.  
VOTE FOR MATT. 
THEY ARE GOING TO SAY THAT WAS 
NOT PRESIDENTIAL. 
WATCH. 
THAT WAS NOT PRESIDENTIAL. 
DID I EVER TELL YOU HOW EASY IT 
WOULD BE FOR ME TO BE 
PRESIDENTIAL? 
LIKE WE ARE ALL REALLY SMART 
PEOPLE. 
I HAVE THE MOST LOYAL PEOPLE IN 
THE WORLD. 
THEY ARE THE SMARTEST PEOPLE. 
THEY ARE THE TOUGHEST PEOPLE. 
THEY ARE THE GREATEST PEOPLE IN 
THE WORLD. 
THEY WILL SAY SOMETHING LIKE 
THAT IS NOT PRESIDENTIAL. 
WHAT I SAY, ACTING PRESIDENTIAL 
IS SO EASY. 
IT IS MUCH EASIER THAN WHAT I 
DO. 
SOMETIMES, I HAVE TO DO THIS. 
YOU WALK UP TO THE MICROPHONE, 
GOOD EVENING LADIES AND 
GENTLEMEN. 
YOU HAVE TO PUT A LITTLE 
EMPHASIS. 
THIS IS WONDERFUL TO BE WITH 
YOU TONIGHT. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE, 
GOODBYE. 
THE PEOPLE OF MONTANA, THEY KNOW
. THE LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE YOU 
HELPED BUILD THIS COUNTRY AND 
TOGETHER, WE ARE TAKING BACK 
OUR COUNTRY, RETURNING THE 
POWER WHERE IT BELONGS, TO THE 
PEOPLE.
>> USA! 
USA! 
USA! 
USA! USA! 
>> OUR PROUD AMERICAN ANCESTORS 
CROSSED OCEANS, SCALED 
MOUNTAINS, DEFEATED EMPIRES AND 
BUILT THE MODERN WORLD WITH 
THEIR OWN TWO HANDS. 
THEY WERE BRILLIANT. 
THIS STATE, THIS STATE OF 
MONTANA, WAS FORGED BY 
INCREDIBLE PIONEER MEN AND 
WOMEN WHO BRAVED THE COLD AND 
TAMED THE WILDERNESS TO BUILD A 
BEAUTIFUL LIFE RIGHT OUT HERE 
IN THE OPEN. 
I DID LOOK AT THE SKY. 
I HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOUR SKY. 
I HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOUR SKY. 
I RODE IN AND I LOOKED AT THE 
SKY. 
I AM NOT -- NOT SEEING POLLUTION
IS A WONDERFUL THING. 
THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL SKIES. 
THESE MONTANA PIONEERS WERE 
TOUGH AND THEY WERE STRONG AND 
THEY WERE BRILLIANT. 
THEY DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF 
MONEY. 
THEY DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF 
LUXURY BUT THEY HAD FAITH. 
THEY HAD HEART. 
THEY HAD GREAT. 
THEY HAD EACH OTHER. 
ABOVE ALL ELSE, THEY LOVED 
THEIR FAMILIES, THEY LOVED 
THEIR COUNTRY AND THEY LOVED 
THEIR GOD.
WE STAND ON THE 
SHOULDERS OF AMERICAN PATRIOTS 
WHO KNEW HOW TO FIGHT AND THEY 
KNEW HOW TO WIN. 
YOU TALK ABOUT WINNING, THEY 
KNEW HOW TO WIN. 
WITH YOUR HELP, YOUR VOICE, AND 
YOUR VOTE, WE ARE GOING TO KEEP 
ON FIGHTING AND WE ARE GOING TO 
KEEP ON WINNING. 
THE TRUTH IS, YOU WILL NEVER, 
EVER GET TIRED OF WINNING. 
NEVER. 
WE WON'T BACK DOWN. WE WON'T 
GIVE IN. 
WE WILL NEVER, EVER SURRENDER. 
WE WILL NEVER, EVER QUIT. 
WE GO FORWARD TO VICTORY. 
WE ARE AMERICANS AND OUR HEARTS 
BLEED RED, WHITE, AND BLUE! 
WE ARE ONE PEOPLE. 
WE ARE ONE FAMILY. 
WE ARE ONE GLORIOUS NATION 
UNDER GOD. TOGETHER, WE WILL 
MAKE AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN! 
SOON. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG 
AGAIN! 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
NEXT POINT THANK YOU, MONTANA. 
THANK YOU 
>> PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP THERE 
WRAPPING UP HIS REMARKS IN 
GREAT FALLS, MONTANA WITH SOME 
FAMILIAR SCENES. 
HE IS TALKING ABOUT A NUMBER OF 
ISSUES FROM IMMIGRATION TO HIS 
UPCOMING SUMMIT WITH RUSSIAN 
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN TO 
ATTACKING MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA. 
LET'S GO TO MOLLY HOOPER AND 
CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER FOR THE 
HILL. 
SHE IS JOINING ME NOW ON THE 
PHONE. 
I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON 
THIS. 
THE PRESIDENT WE HEARD TOOK 
SEVERAL JOBS AT SENATOR JON 
TESTER, THE DEMOCRAT. 
AT THE SAME TIME, HE DID NOT 
SAY MUCH ABOUT HIS REPUBLICAN 
OPPONENT, MATT ROSENDALE, WHOM 
HE WAS THERE PRESUMABLY TO 
BOOST. 
WHAT STOOD OUT TO YOU IN TERMS 
OF HOW THE PRESIDENT TRIED TO 
FRAME THIS MONTANA SENATE RACE? 
>> Reporter: THAT WAS A 
COMPREHENSIVE RALLY. 
THAT IS ALL I COULD SAY. 
HE TOUCHED ON A LOT OF POINTS. 
HE DID GO AFTER JON TESTER. 
IT FEELS LIKE IT WAS JUST 
YESTERDAY BUT SEVERAL WEEKS 
AGO, A FEW MONTHS AGO, THE 
PRESIDENT APPOINTED A 
REPLACEMENT FOR FORMER VA 
SECRETARY DAVID SHULKIN IN 
RONNIE JACKSON. 
JON TESTER IS THE TOP-RANKED 
DEMOCRAT ON THE SENATE COMMITTEE
WHICH ESSENTIALLY KILLED THE 
NOMINATION BY LEAKING A LOT OF 
STORIES ABOUT RONNIE JACKSON. 
THAT SHOWED HIM INVOLVED IN 
SOME SORT OF SCANDAL. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID AT THE TIME 
"I WILL GET YOU JON TESTER." 
TONIGHT, HE DID. 
BASICALLY HE TOOK ON JON 
TESTER, TELLING THE CROWD THAT 
JON TESTER HAS SAID THE 
PRESIDENT IS A GREAT GUY BUT 
VOTES AGAINST HIM EVERY TURN. 
IT IS FUNNY BECAUSE AT ONE 
POINT, THE PRESIDENT SAID HE 
WOULD RATHER HAVE A GUY THAT 
SAID BAD THINGS ABOUT ME BUT 
VOTED WITH ME 100% OF THE TIME. 
INCIDENTALLY, HE DOES HAVE THAT 
IN SENATOR JEFF FLAKE. 
HOWEVER, JEFF FLAKE IS NOT 
RUNNING FOR REELECTION. 
THAT SAID, THE PRESIDENT DID GO 
AFTER JON TESTER. TESTER WAS 
READY FOR THIS. 
TODAY, HE TOOK OUT 16 FULL-PAGE 
ADS IN MONTANA SAYING "WELCOME 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. 
I AM GLAD YOU ARE HERE." 
THANK YOU FOR SIGNING A NUMBER 
OF BILLS THAT I PUSHED. 
IT WAS AN INTERESTING, LIVELY, 
ALL-ENCOMPASSING RALLY IN 
MONTANA. 
>> WE ALSO HEARD WHAT SEEMED TO 
BE SOME NEW RHETORIC IN HIS 
PERIODIC ATTACKS AGAINST 
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR ELIZABETH 
WARREN OF MASSACHUSETTS WHO IS 
RUNNING FOR REELECTION. 
TELL US WHAT HE OFFERED TO DO. 
I DON'T THINK THAT IS SOMETHING 
I HAVE HEARD BEFORE FROM HIM. 
>> I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT EITHER.
HE BASICALLY SAID -- HE CALLED 
ELIZABETH WARREN BY A WORD, 
POCAHONTAS. 
ELIZABETH WARREN ONCE CLAIMED 
THAT SHE IS PART CHEROKEE. 
SHE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME 
PROVING A. HE SAID IF I EVER 
HAVE TO DEBATE ELIZABETH WARREN 
IN A PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE DOWN 
THE ROAD, I THINK WHAT I WILL 
DO IS I WILL GET ONE OF THOSE 
DNA KITS. 
I THINK SHE NEEDS TO TEST HER 
DNA TO SEE IF SHE IS IN FACT 
NATIVE AMERICAN. 
HE DID NOT USE THE TERM NATIVE 
AMERICAN, HE USED THE WORD 
INDIAN. 
I HAVE A FEELING THAT THAT WILL 
NOT GO OVER VERY WELL AMONG HIS 
OPPONENTS. 
I AM NOT SURE -- THE CROWD 
SEEMED TO CHEER IT ON. 
I THINK THAT -- HE GETS THE 
CROWD FIRED UP AND IT WAS AT A 
POINT IN WHICH HE WAS GETTING 
THEM FIRED UP. 
HE FEEDS OFF OF THAT ENERGY. 
YOU COULD SEE HIM GOING AND 
GOING. 
IN MY MIND, I THINKING THAT I 
NEED TO LOOK AT MY EMAIL. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
>> Reporter: HE WAS LOADED 
TONIGHT. 
>> NO SHORTAGE OF RED MEAT ON 
THIS ONE. 
MOLLY HOOPER, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>>> I'M ELAINE QUIJANO.
