ARE OUT THERE, OF COURSE IF WE 
HAVE INJURED OR FATALITIES, IT 
IS JUST GOING TO BRING THOSE 
ISSUES BACK TO THE FORE, AND 
SUPERCHARGE THEM ONE MORE 
TIME.>> RON, I WANT TO BRING IN 
GILBERT DIAZ, A CBS NEWS 
PHOTOJOURNALIST, JOINTLY BY 
PHONE, CAN YOU TELL ME THE 
EXACT LOCATION AND WHAT YOU 
HAVE SEEN SO FAR?>> I AM HERE, 
AT THE HEADQUARTERS, A LARGE 
POLICE PRESENCE, ANY CARS, THE 
STREETS -- MANY CARS, THE 
STREETS ARE BLOCKED OFF, IT 
LOOKS LIKE THOSE WORKERS AT THE 
YOUTUBE CORPORATION, THEY ARE 
ALL IN THE PARKING LOT, THEY 
HAD BEEN MOVED AWAY, LARGE 
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE IN THE 
PARKING LOT, AND THE HUGE 
POLICE PRESENCE, MANY POLICE 
CARS KEEPING EVERYBODY BACK.
>> GILBERT, WE ARE HEARING 
REPORTS THAT IN FACT THERE ARE 
PATIENT WHO ARE EXPECTED TO BE 
HEADING TOWARD THE GENERAL 
HOSPITAL THERE, NOT FAR, HAVE 
YOU SEEN ANY PEOPLE TAKEN AWAY 
IN AMBULANCES AT THIS POINT?>> 
NOT AT THIS TIME, I AM STANDING 
RIGHT HERE, I CAN CLEARLY SEE 
THE YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS, LOTS 
OF POLICE PRESENCE, NO 
AMBULANCES OR ANYBODY -- 
ALTHOUGH I DO SEE A COUPLE OF 
AMBULANCES PART, BUT NOBODY 
BEING TAKEN AWAY THIS TIME. 
THERE ARE S.W.A.T. 
TEAMS PRESENT, A LOT OF PEOPLE 
JUST LOOKING ON, HELICOPTERS 
OVERHEAD, AND IT LOOKS AS THOUGH
PEOPLE ARE SORT OF STANDING BY 
TO DETERMINE WHAT THE NEXT MOVE 
IS. 
A HUGE POLICE PRESENCE, LOTS OF 
POLICE CARS, MANY OF THE AREAS 
ARE BLOCKED OFF, I DON'T SEE 
ANYONE LEAVING IN TERMS OF 
AMBULANCES OR INJURE, ANYTHING 
LIKE THAT AT'S POINT.>> DO WE 
KNOW ANYTHING MORE -- AT THIS 
POINT.>> DO WE KNOW ANYTHING 
MORE ABOUT A POTENTIAL SHOOTER?
>> NO, WE DO NOT, A NUMBER OF 
POLICE FOLKS THAT I MIGHT BE 
ABLE TO ASK. 
EXCUSE ME, I AM ON THE AIR 
RIGHT NOW, DOES ANYBODY HAVE 
ANY INFORMATION AT THIS POINT?
>> GILBERT, I'M GOING TO HAVE 
YOU STAND BY, AS YOU ARE 
SPEAKING TO FOLKS ON THE 
GROUND, WE WANT TO CONTINUE OUR 
LIVE COVERAGE WITH OUR SAN 
FRANCISCO STATION, KPNX.
>> POLICE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT, 
MULTIPLE SHOT, THEY TREATED OUT 
EARLIER, ADVISING PEOPLE TO 
STAY. 
>> WE ARE HEARING THAT THE 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF ALCOHOL, 
TOBACCO AND FIREARMS IS ON THE 
SCENE, IN ADDITION TO ALL OF 
THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICERS, SAN BRUNO, SAN 
FRANCISCO, THEY ARE ALL THERE 
ON THE SCENE OF THE YOUTUBE 
HEADQUARTERS IN SAN BRUNO, TO 
ACK THIS UP, THIS STARTED JUST 
AFTER 1 PM, AND WE ARE HEARING 
THAT THE SHOOTING STARTED AT AN 
OUTDOOR CAFCAT YOUTUBE, AND 
SEE WHERE THE BUILDING IS THERE 
ON THE SCREEN, RIGHT BY THE 
INTERSECTION OF 280 AND 380 IN 
SAN BRUNO, AND WE HAVE NO IDEA 
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SHOT, 
BUT MULTIPLE PEOPLE, AND THEY 
ARE ALREADY ON THE WAY TO THE 
HOSPITAL AT SAN FRANCISCO 
GENERAL, THEY ARE NOT GIVING US 
ANY CONFIRMATION OF THE NUMBER 
OF PEOPLE, OR THE CONDITIONS AT 
THIS POINT, WE ALSO DON'T KNOW 
IF THERE COULD BE MORE VICTIMS 
STILL IN THE BUILDING, NOR IF 
THE SHOOTER IS STILL IN THERE 
OR WHAT THAT PERSON OR PERSON, 
FOR THAT MATTER, THEIR STATUSES.
WE ARE JUST WATCHING THESE LIVE 
PICTURES ALONG WITH YOU BEING 
TAKEN RIGHT NOW, FROM CHOPPER 5,
AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF VICTIMS, 
AFTER A SHOOTING TOOK PLACE, AS 
LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTINUES TO 
GET PEOPLE OUT SAFELY, TRYING 
TO ZERO IN ON A SUSPECT OR 
SUSPECTS, WE SAW EARLIER, 
PEOPLE RUNNING OUT OF THE 
BUILDING WITH THEIR HANDS UP, AS
POLICE RAN INTO THE BUILDING, 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE 
STILL TRYING TO CLEAR AT THIS 
POINT, AND FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND 
OF DANGER THERE MAY STILL BE 
PRESENT. 
IT DOES LOOK LIKE SEVERAL 
EMPLOYEES ARE OUTSIDE, ALONG 
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.>> WE HAVE 
BEEN LISTENING IN TO LIVE 
COVERAGE OF OUR SAN FRANCISCO 
AFFILIATE, KPIX, WE ARE 
FOLLOWING REPORTS FROM THE 
POLICE THAT THIS IS AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER SITUATION AT YOUTUBE 
HEADQUARTERS, THOUSANDS OF 
EMPLOYEES COME TO WORK EVERY 
DAY, SOME OF THOSE FOLKS HAVE 
BEEN ABLE TO EVACUATE, I WANT 
TO BRING IN CBS NEWS, PAUL, 
THEY HAVE AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF 
VICTIMS, WHAT YOU MAKE OF 
THIS?>> THAT IS NOT SURPRISING, 
THAT NUMBER IS GOING TO GO UP, 
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR 
OUR VIEWERS TO UNDERSTAND IS 
WITH THE PROCESSES, BECAUSE 
WHAT YOU ARE SEEING ON 
TELEVISION IS REALLY JUST THE 
BIG MACRO PICTURE OF AN OUTSIDE 
PERIMETER, NEED TO UNDERSTAND 
THERE ARE TWO PERIMETERS, THE 
INSIDE PERIMETER, THE SHOOTING 
PIECE OF THE BUILDING ITSELF, 
WHERE THEY BELIEVE THE ACTIVE 
SHOOTER IS, AN OUTSIDE PERIMETER
, AND POLICE ARE IN THE PROCESS 
OF CONTAINMENT AND EVACUATION, 
NEED TO EVACUATE WHOEVER THEY 
CAN WHEN THEY CAN, 
SIMULTANEOUSLY, EXAMINING EVERY 
PIECE OF CCTV OR CLOSED-CIRCUIT 
TELEVISION FOOTAGE TO ASCERTAIN 
AS MUCH INFORMATION AS THEY CAN 
REGARDING WHO THE SHOOTER IS, 
MALE OR FEMALE, I AM 
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS 
POTENTIALLY A FEMALE THAT CAME 
INTO THE BACK OF THE BUILDING, 
HAT IS WHAT I'M BEING T 
I APOLOGIZE, YOU ARE HEARING A 
FEMALE SHOOTER, WHERE -- THAT 
IS YOUR SECURITY SOURCES
CONFIRMING THAT?>> THAT IS 
CORRECT, I HAVE HEARD IT FROM 
TWO DIFFERENT SOURCES ON THE 
GROUND, AND --
>>  WE ARE GOING TO HEAD TO A 
SPECIAL REPORT WITH JEFF GLOR. 
>>> I AM JEFF GLOR REPORTING,  
FROM NEW YORK, BREAKING NEWS IN 
SAN BRUNO CALIFORNIA, SOUTH OF 
SAN FRANCISCO, POLICE ARE 
RESPONDING TO REPORTS OF AN 
ACTIVE SHOOTER, AT THE 
HEADQUARTERS OF YOUTUBE, OWNED 
BY GOOGLE, WHICH IS OWNED BY 
ALPHABET, THE COMPANIES ARE 
RESPONDING, SAYING THEY ARE 
CORDONING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, 
WE ARE WATCHING THE SCENE THIS 
AFTERNOON AS IT UNFOLDED A 
LITTLE BIT AFTER LUNCHTIME 
PACIFIC, AND AGAIN, YOUTUBE 
HEADQUARTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN 
GOOGLE, YOUTUBE HAS ITS OWN 
BUILDING THEREIN SAN BRUNO, 
RELATIVELY LOW-PROFILE BUILDING,
BUT THE BUILDING ITSELF IS VERY 
CLOSE TO SFO, THE SAN FRANCISCO 
AIRPORT, JUST A COUPLE OF MILES 
AWAY, A FOUR-MINUTE OR FIVE-
MINUTE DRIVE. 
JAMIE?>> IT IS IMPORTANT TO SAY 
THAT THIS IS A FLUID SITUATION 
AT THIS POINT, MANY WITNESSES 
DESCRIBED HEARING GUNSHOTS, WE 
DO KNOW THAT NO DEATHS HAVE 
BEEN REPORTED RIGHT NOW, WE 
ALSO KNOW THAT SAN FRANCISCO 
GENERAL HOSPITAL IS TAKING IN 
PATIENTS, ALTHOUGH AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTING HAS NOT BEEN 
OFFICIALLY CONFIRMED, AS MANY AS
HALF A DOZEN PATIENTS MAY HAVE 
BEEN TAKEN INTO EMPHASIS GO 
GENERAL HOSPITAL, BUT THAT 
NUMBER IS ALSO FLUID AT THIS 
POINT TIME. 
-- AT THIS POINT IN TIME. 
THE LAST HOUR, WE HAVE WATCHED 
MANY EMPLOYEES LEAVE YOUTUBE'S 
HEADQUARTERS AT THIS POINT, 
ABOUT 1700 EMPLOYEES, AT THE 
HEADQUARTERS, MANY EMPLOYEES 
CAME FUNNELED THROUGH MANY 
EXITS, A COORDINATED EFFORT BY 
POLICE, TO GET EMPLOYEES OUT OF 
CERTAIN EXITS WITHIN THE 
BUILDING, THEY THEN LINED UP, 
AND POLICE ARE GOING IN PATTING 
DOWN PEOPLE EXITING THE 
BUILDING, BUT NOT ALL OF THEM, 
WE TALKED TO SOME SECURITY 
EXPERTS ABOUT THAT ON THE 
DIGITAL CHANNEL, CBSN,  WE 
DISCUSSED THAT MIGHT INDICATE 
THEY DO NOT HAVE THE SHOOTER 
YET CUSTODY, OR KNOW WHERE THAT 
SHOOTER IS, THIS IS AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTING SITUATION, OR THEY 
MIGHT THINK THAT THERE IS A 
SECOND OR THIRD PERSON THAT 
MIGHT HAVE SOME TYPE OF WEAPON 
ON. 
THEY WILL BE PATTING PEOPLE 
DOWN, WITH THESE LARGE 
COMPLEXES, HOLDING 1700 
EMPLOYEES, THERE CAN BE OTHER 
PLACES THE SHOOTER ZINGO, 
INCLUDING GARAGE BUILDINGS, 
THAT KIND OF THINGS THAT THEY 
GET UP ON, THEY DON'T WANT TO 
HAVE A SECOND HAPPEN. 
WE KNOW THAT THE ATF IS 
RESPONDING, THE SAN MATEO 
COUNTY CORONER HAS NOT BEEN 
CALLED TO THE SCENE, INDICATING 
THAT THEY HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY 
REPORTS OF DEATHS AT THIS POINT.
GOOGLE, THE COMMUNICATIONS 
PEOPLE IN CHARGE OF THE 
SITUATION, BECAUSE THEY ARE THE 
ONES WHO IN FACT RUN YOUTUBE, 
SAYING THAT THEY ARE IN 
COMMUNICATION WITH AUTHORITIES, 
AND WILL PROVIDE OFFICIAL 
INFORMATION FROM GOOGLE AND 
YOUTUBE AS SOON AS IT BECOMES 
AVAILABLE, AGAIN, WE HAVE 
WATCHED SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES 
COMING OUT OF THE BUILDING, A 
VERY FLUID SITUATION, NO DEATHS,
NO CONFIRMED NUMBER OF VICTIMS, 
BUT SEVERAL PEOPLE ON THE 
PHONE, AS WE HAVE BEEN CALLING 
AROUND AND ASKING, HAVE SAID AS 
MANY AS HALF A DOZEN PEOPLE 
TAKE TO THE HOSPITAL.>> THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH, GOOGLE, WHICH 
OWNS YOUTUBE, WHILE GOOGLE OWNS 
IT, THEY ARE SEPARATE 
BUILDINGS, OPERATE AS SEPARATE 
COMPANIES LARGELY, AS YOU TO úH 
TERMS OF HOW IT OPERATES, THIS 
IS YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS, WHICH 
IS SMALLER THAN GOOGLE AS A 
WHOLE, BUT A LOT OF THE TECH 
COMPANIES AND BIOTECH, THEY 
PRIDE THEMSELVES ON THE 
OPENNESS, AND AVAILABILITY, AND 
THE CAMPUSES, GETTING AROUND ON 
THE CAMPUS. 
SO WE ARE WINNING TO GET MORE 
INFORMATION ON THIS, MUCH MORE 
ON YOUR LOCAL NEWS ON THIS 
SEPIA STATION, AND THE 24 HOUR 
STREAMING SERVICE, CBSN,  AND 
THE CBS EVENING NEWS, I AM JEFF 
GLOR, SEE YOU SOON . -- CBS 
STATION.
>>> WE'VE GOT LIVE COVERAGE, 
CONTINUING, OF THIS LIVE ACTIVE 
SHOOTER SITUATION THAT YOUTUBE 
HEADQUARTERS. 
I AM ENJOYING BY PAUL, WHO 
JOINS US BY PHONE, YOU ARE 
SAYING THAT SOME OF YOUR 
SECURITY SOURCES ARE SAYING 
THERE MIGHT BE A POTENTIAL ID 
THE SHOOTER MIGHT BE?>> THAT IS 
CORRECT, BEFORE WE BROKE, WHAT 
I'VE BEEN TOLD BY TWO DIFFERENT 
SOURCES, CONSIDERATION RIGHT 
NOW ON THE FACT THAT THIS MAY 
INVOLVE A WHITE FEMALE SHOOTER 
THAT MIGHT HAVE ENTERED THE 
REAR OF THE BUILDING.>> AND 
REPORTS FROM STANFORD 
HEALTHCARE, THEY HAVE NOW 
RECEIVED FOUR OR FIVE PATIENTS 
FROM THIS SHOOTING SITUATION AT 
YOUTUBE, I WANT TO BRING IN 
FORMER ASSISTANT FBI DIRECTOR 
AND CBS NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, RON 
HARSCO, THIS COULD POTENTIALLY 
BE A WHITE FEMALE, WHAT YOU 
MAKE OF THAT?
>> VERY UNUSUAL, IN THE STUDIES 
WE TALKED ABOUT, EVERY SHOOTER, 
EVERY MASS ATTACKER THEY 
FEMALE ATTRACTORS TEND TO BE 
THE EXCEPTION. 
THE LAST SITUATION WE HAD WAS 
SAN BERNARDINO WHERE WE HAD TWO 
TERROR INSPIRED INDIVIDUALS. 
AFTER KILLING A NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE IN A CONFERENCE CENTER 
OUT THERE --  
>> I APOLOGIZE. 
I HAVE TO CUT YOU OFF. 
I HAVE A AN EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT. 
>>IN MY POCKET. 
>> AND I HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT 
YOU HAVE.  
>> IT'S DEAD. 
YOU HAVE TO CHARGE IT. 
>> IS IT AN iPHONE? 
>> IT'S AN LG.  
>> THE GIRL RAN OUT. 
THEN THE OTHER GUY THAT WAS 
THERE IN FRONT OF ME, HE STAYED 
THERE. THEY ALL WENT TO ALL OF 
THESE LOCKER ROOMS AND THEY ARE 
ALL LOCKED UP.  
>> Reporter: HOW LONG DID THE 
WHOLE ORDEAL TAKE. 
>> THE WHOLE THING? 
ABOUT 1 1/2 MINUTES.  
>> Reporter: WERE YOU SCARED? 
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? 
>> I WAS SCARED BUT I KNEW THAT 
I HAD TO RUN FOR COVER.  
>> Reporter: THIS GENTLEMAN 
RIGHT HERE SAYS HE WAS ORDERING 
FOOD DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM THE 
YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS ENTERED 
THE SHOTS AND SAW WHAT 
HAPPENED. 
I'M GOING TO JUMP IN AND ASK 
QUESTIONS AS WE GO. 
HE SAYS IT'S ALL ABOUT A PARTY 
THAT WAS HAPPENING AT THE 
YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS.  
>> RIGHT THERE IN THE DRIVE 
THROUGH, THEN I RAN AROUND BACK 
AROUND THE BUILDING AND THEN I 
WENT TO SEE. 
THAT'S WHEN THE GIRL WENT PAST 
ME. 
I RAN OVER THERE. 
THE FIRST GIRL.  
>> Reporter: THEY BROUGHT HER 
INTO THE CHARLES -- CARL'S JR.? 
>> YES, AND AT THE SAME TIME I 
LOOK BACK AND SHE PUT HER LEG 
ON THE TABLE.  
>> Reporter: THEN YOU WENT BACK 
OUT. 
>> THEN I WENT BACK OUT TO SEE 
WHAT WAS GOING ON. 
AND THEN THE OTHER LADY WAS 
THERE. AND HE WAS THERE. 
HE SEDGE SHE IS SHOP. 
SHE'S DEAD. 
AND I SAID, I HEARD IT. 
IT WAS RIGHT THERE.  
>> Reporter: HOW MANY SHOTS? 
>> AND HEINZ, THE SECOND TIME, 
RAPID FIRE, IT DIDN'T STOP. 
THERE WAS NO MERCY. 
WHOEVER SHOT THAT TIME, IT WAS 
MASSIVE.  
>> Reporter: THERE WAS A SECOND 
AND THIRD VICTIM? 
>> AND I THINK HE SHOT SOMEONE 
ELSE BECAUSE THERE WERE FOUR 
MORE SHOTS AFTER THAT. 
IT WENT BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM, AND 
THEN AFTER THAT I HEARD 
NOTHING.  
>> Reporter: WHAT'S GOING 
THROUGH YOUR MIND WITH PEOPLE 
BEING SHOT MULTIPLE TIMES, 
BULLETS WHIZZING? 
PEOPLE ARE BLEEDING. WHAT'S 
GOING ON IN YOUR MIND? 
>> I KNEW I HAD TO BE SMART. 
YOU HAVE TO BE FAST. 
YOU HAVE TO THINK FAST AND 
SMART. 
I DIDN'T HAVE A GUN ON ME BUT I 
WISH I DID.  
>> Reporter: DESCRIBE FOR ME 
WHERE YOU WERE.  
>> Reporter: THIS GENTLEMAN 
SAYS THERE WERE THREE VICTIMS. 
ONE WAS THE WOMAN WE TALKED 
ABOUT EARLIER WHO WAS BROUGHT 
INTO THE CARLS WITH A GUNSHOT 
WOUND. 
AND HE SAYS IN HIS OWN WORDS, 
NO MERCY. 
THERE WAS POSSIBLY A THIRD 
VICTIM BECAUSE HE HEARD MORE 
SHOTS AFTER THAT. 
THIS STARTED AT SOME SORT OF UP 
PARTY OR CELEBRATION AT THE 
YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS, INSIDE 
THE FACILITY, NOT OUTSIDE. 
FROM WHAT I AM TOLD, THE 
SHOOTER DIDN'T WALK UP TO THE 
FACILITY BUT WAS ALREADY INSIDE 
AND STARTED SHOOTING.  
>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING INTO 
OUR AFFILIATE COVERAGE ON THE 
YOUTUBE SHOOTING IN SAN BRUNO, 
CALIFORNIA. 
I WANT TO BRING IN CBS NEWS 
CORRESPONDENT JAMIE YUCCAS WHO 
JOINS US FROM LAS VEGAS. 
I TAKE IT YOU ARE LISTENING IN 
ON THAT INTERVIEW AS WELL. 
THEM AND SAYS THIS SHOOTING 
TOOK PLACE AT A PARTY AT 
YOUTUBE AND HE WITNESSED THREE 
VICTIMS AND ALSO WAS SAYING, 
THERE WAS NO MERCY. 
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?  
>> Reporter: WE HAVE BEEN 
HEARING SIMILAR ACCOUNTS AS WE 
HAD BEEN STANDING HERE 
WITNESSING -- LISTENING AND 
WATCHING AND FROM OUR 
COLLEAGUES GETTING TO THE SCENE 
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A FLUID 
SITUATION BUT A NUMBER OF 
WITNESSES DID IN FACT, HERE THE 
SHOTS BEING FIRED. WHAT WE DO 
KNOW RIGHT NOW, WE JUST GOT 
WORD FROM STANFORD HEALTHCARE, 
THEY ARE EXPECTING 4 TO 5 
PATIENTS FROM THIS SHOOTING. 
THAT'S NEW INFORMATION. 
A SHORT TIME AGO, SAN FRANCISCO 
GENERAL HOSPITAL SAID THEY 
COULD NOT CONFIRM THE NUMBER OF 
PATIENTS THAT THEY WOULD BE 
TAKING IN, BUT THAT THEY WERE 
IN FACT, TAKING SOME IN, AND 
THAT COULD BE UP TO A HALF-
DOZEN. 
THERE'S POSSIBLY 11 VICTIMS 
BEING TAKEN TO LOCAL HOSPITALS 
AS FAR AS WE KNOW RIGHT NOW. 
LUCKILY, THE LOCAL CORONER HAS 
SAID NO DEATHS HAVE BEEN 
REPORTED AND'S OFFICE HAS NOT 
BEEN CALLED TO THE SCENE AT 
THIS POINT IN TIME. 
THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT IS 
GOOD NEWS AT THIS POINT IN THE 
DAY. 
OF COURSE, THAT SITUATION CAN 
CHANGE VERY QUICKLY. 
IT'S UNKNOWN WHAT THE SUBJECT 
DESCRIPTION IS AT THIS POINT. 
THAT HAS BEEN FLOATING BACK AND 
FORTH. 
AS YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING, IN 
THIS VIDEO, RENA, AS THESE 
WORKERS HAVE BEEN COMING OUT OF 
THE HEADQUARTERS, THERE IS 
ABOUT 1700 EMPLOYEES THAT WORK 
STRICTLY AT THE YOUTUBE 
HEADQUARTERS IN SAN BRUNO. 
YOU ARE WATCHING THE LINES AND 
YOU CAN SEE THAT A NUMBER OF 
EMPLOYEES WERE BEING FUNNELED 
OUT, SOME OF THEM BEING PATTED 
DOWN WHICH WOULD INDICATE THEY 
ARE EITHER LOOKING FOR THE 
SUSPECT ARE LOOKING TO MAKE 
SURE THERE ISN'T A SECOND OR 
POTENTIALLY THIRD ACTIVE 
SHOOTER AT THE SCENE. 
AGAIN, THE ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND 
FIREARMS IS RESPONDING. 
WE KNOW THAT AS WELL. GOOGLE 
HAS SAID, THE PARENT COMPANY OF 
YOUTUBE, THAT THEY ARE 
MONITORING THE SITUATION AND 
WORKING WITH AUTHORITIES. 
úTHEY 
INFORMATION AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE. 
WE KNOW FROM EYEWITNESS 
ACCOUNTS, AT THE SCENE, THERE 
WERE A NUMBER OF VICTIMS THAT 
WERE EITHER GOING TO OTHER 
BUSINESSES IN THIS AREA -- 
GOOGLE ALSO HAS A BASE THAT'S 
THERE RIGHT NEXT-DOOR TO 
YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS. 
IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT GOOGLE WAS 
AFFECTED. PEOPLE FROM THE 
VARIOUS BUILDINGS DID HEAR 
SHOTS BEING FIRED IN THE AREA. 
AT THIS POINT IN TIME, AGAIN, I 
WANT TO REITERATE, SAN 
FRANCISCO GENERAL IS SAYING 
THEY ARE RECEIVING PATIENTS, UP 
TO POTENTIALLY SIX. 
STANFORD HEALTHCARE IS ALSO 
TAKING IN 4 -- 4 TO 5 AT THIS 
TIME. 
THAT THE INFORMATION WE HAVE AT 
THIS TIME FROM LOS ANGELES, 
REENA.   
>> THAT'S AN UPDATE ON THE 
SHOOTING AT THE YOUTUBE 
HEADQUARTERS NEAR LOS ANGELES. 
WE ARE ALSO HEARING THAT ATF IS 
ALSO PRESENT ON THE SCENE. 
JAMIE HAS BEEN REPORTING ALSO, 
ON THE VARIOUS HOSPITAL 
FACILITIES. 
I NOW WANT TO ADMIT TO FORMER 
FBI DIRECTOR AND ANALYST RON 
HOSKO. WE HEARD FROM SOURCES 
THAT IT UP ATTENTION CHILLY -- 
THAT THE SHOOTER COULD 
POTENTIALLY BE A WHITE FEMALE. 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? 
DOES THIS FIT ANY SORT OF 
PROFILE?  
>> Reporter: IT DOESN'T,  
REENA. 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO PROFILE THESE 
CASES  WITH ANY TYPE OF 
OVERWHELMING CERTAINTY. 
YOU HAVE ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT 
DRIVERS, USUALLY PEOPLE WITH 
DIFFERENT STRESSORS IN THEIR 
LIVES. 
WHETHER THERE IS A MENTAL 
HEALTH ASPECT OF IT OR NOT, 
VERY OFTEN WHAT YOU SEE IS, 
THESE ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY 
MALES. THESE ATTACKERS ARE 
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY MALE 
ATTACKERS. 
TO COME UP WITH ANY KIND OF 
MEANINGFUL PROFILE ON A FEMALE 
ACTIVE SHOOTER, MATH SHOOTER, 
MASS ATTACKER, WOULD BE 
DIFFICULT TO DO BECAUSE 
NUMERICALLY THEY ARE SO SMALL. 
>> I ALSO WANT TO BRING IN PAUL 
THE A LIST. 
DO WE STILL HAVE PAUL WITH US? 
UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK WE MAY 
HAVE LOST HIM. 
RON, IF I COULD ASK YOU, WHEN 
EYEWITNESS SAYING THERE WAS NO 
MERCY AND RELATED TO THE 
SHOOTING. 
HE SAID IT HAPPENED AT A PARTY, 
SOME SORT OF CELEBRATION. YOU 
TALK ABOUT SECURING A PERIMETER 
LIKE THIS. HOW DO YOU HARD IN A 
PLACE LIKE THIS?  
>> Reporter: FIRST IN A 
BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENT LIKE 
THIS WHERE THERE WAS MORE OF A 
CAMPUS ATMOSPHERE THEN THERE IS 
-- THEN YOU WOULD FIND IN A 
MIDDLE SCHOOL OR HIGH SCHOOL, 
WHERE SECURITY IS INTENDED TO 
BE FIRMER, YOU ARE REALLY 
TRYING TO LIMIT PEOPLE COMING 
IN AND GOING OUT FROM A WIDE 
NUMBER OF ENTRANCES. 
THAT TENDS NOT TO BE THE CASE 
WITH BUSINESSES. 
OFTENTIMES THEY ARE BUILT TO BE 
WELCOMING AND WELCOMING --  
WELCOMING IN THEIR APPEARANCE. 
THERE'S OFTEN MANY DORSET 
PEOPLE CAN COME IN AND OUT OF 
CASUALLY, SOMETIMES WITH SOME 
SORT OF A CAR READER. VERY OFTEN
THESE ARE VERY OPEN CAMPUSES 
AND INTENDED TO BE THAT WAY. 
THAT CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO 
DEAL WITH.  
>> I HAVE A INTERVIEW I WANT TO 
PLAY OUT. 
>> I CAME IN TO GET A 
MILKSHAKE. 
WHEN I WAS COMING IN THERE WAS 
A BIG COMMOTION COMING FROM 
ACROSS THE STREET. 
LADY CAME AND WENT INTO THE 
CARL'S JR. AND HAD BEEN SHOT IN 
THE FOOT. 
THAT WAS ABOUT AT THE TIME THE 
POLICE DARTED TO COME IN AND 
THE NEXT THING THEY CAME IN 
FROM EVERY DIRECTION.  
>> Reporter: TALK ABOUT THE 
WOMAN THAT WAS SHOT? 
HOW CLOSE WERE YOU TO THE 
VICTIM OF THE CARL'S JR.? 
>> THERE WERE PEOPLE COMING 
FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. 
IT WAS PROBABLY AS FAR FROM ME 
AS ME TO THE CAMERA.  
>> Reporter: AS YOU WERE 
LOOKING AT THE VICTIM, WERE 
PEOPLE AROUND HER? 
DID YOU SEE BLOOD?  
>> YES, THE POLICE CAME OVER. 
AMBULANCES CAME OVER. 
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PARAMEDICS 
BACKED INTO THE PARKING LOT. 
THEY LOADED HER UP INTO THE 
AMBULANCE AND TOOK HER AWAY,  
>> Reporter: WHAT DID SHE LOOK 
LIKE WHEN YOU SAW HER? 
WHAT WAS SHE WEARING? 
>> REGULAR DARK THIS IS CLOSE. 
-- BUSINESS CLOTHING. 
SHE WAS SHOT IN THE FOOT. 
I DIDN'T PHYSICALLY SEE IT BUT 
EVERYONE WAS LOOKING AT HER. 
I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAN IN AND GET
REALLY NOSY.  
>> Reporter: XO THERE WERE 
PEOPLE CROWDED AROUND HER 
TRYING TO HELP HER OUT AT THAT 
TIME. 
>> YES. 
>> DID THEY SEEM TO BE 
EMPLOYEES OF THE RESTAURANT OR 
EMPLOYEES OF YOUTUBE? 
>> PERHAPS BUT I DON'T REALLY 
THINK THEY WERE YOUTUBE 
EMPLOYEES. 
I THINK IT WAS JUST WHOEVER WAS 
AROUND.  
>> Reporter: YOU SAID THE 
AUTHORITIES WHEN INTO THE 
BUILDING. 
>> YES, AND THEN FROM ALL 
DIRECTIONS OR WAS EVERY CITY -- 
THERE HAS GOT TO BE 300 POLICE 
CARS HERE. 
úTHERE WEREN'T THAT  
TIME BUT THEY KEPT COMING. 
I DROVE THROUGH THE 
INTERSECTION AND I WAS THERE 
RIGHT WHEN THIS STARTED. 
A BIG BLACK S.W.A.T. 
VAN CAME UP AND THEN A 
CAMOUFLAGED SWOT MAN CAME A -- 
S.W.A.T. 
VAN CAME AROUND. 
THAT'S WHAT I SAW.  
>> Reporter: YOU STILL DID NOT 
SEE THE OFFICERS, BECAUSE YOU 
HAVE BEEN PRETTY CLOSE TO THE 
SCENE FOR THE LAST HOUR OR SO. 
>>THEY KEPT GOING AND 
STRATEGICALLY. 
THEY DID NOT COME OUT. 
MAYBE A COUPLE DID BUT I DIDN'T 
SEE THE MAJORITY OF THEM COMING 
OUT.  
>> Reporter: STEVE DEMPSEY, 
THANK YOU FOR SHARING SOME 
VIDEO WITH US AND TELLING US 
WHAT HAPPENED. 
WE WILL HAVE THAT FOR YOU HERE 
COMING UP SHORTLY AS WE GET 
THEM TO YOU. 
WE ARE HOPING TO SPEAK TO 
AUTHORITIES AT SOME POINT SO WE 
CAN GET AN OFFICIAL WORD ON 
WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE OF THE 
BUILDING. 
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? 
WE WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN WE 
HEAR BACK FROM THEM.  
>> I WANT TO BRING IN JENNA 
LANE WHO WAS A REPORTER FOR 
KCBS. 
SHE'S AT THE SCENE AND JOINS ME 
NOW. 
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING?  
>> Reporter: WHAT I AM SEEING 
IS A LOT OF EMPLOYEES BEING 
DISMISSED BY THE POLICE. 
THIS IS JUST A FEW MINUTES 
AFTER THEY WERE ESCORTED AFTER 
THE BUILDING -- OUT OF THE 
BUILDING, MANY OF THEM WITH 
THEIR HANDS ON THEIR HEADS, TO 
AN AREA ACROSS FROM THEIR 
HEADQUARTERS ON CHERRY AVENUE. 
THEY ARE NOW HEADED TO A 
DIFFERENT BUILDING ON THE 
CAMPUS. 
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK 
WITH THEM YET. 
WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THE 
BUILDING HAS BEEN EVACUATED 
AFTER THIS REPORTED SHOOTING 
INCIDENT. 
IT IS STILL COVERED IN LAW 
ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL. 
WE HAVE FIREFIGHTERS AND 
AMBULANCES STANDING BY AS WELL 
AS DOZENS OF POLICE VEHICLES 
FROM AGENCIES ALL AROUND THIS 
PART OF THE BAY AREA.  
>> Reporter: FOR FOLKS THAT 
AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH THIS AREA, 
WHAT'S AROUND THIS YOUTUBE 
FACILITY? 
>>  
>> Reporter: THERE'S A SHOPPING 
CENTER AND A PARK NEARBY. 
MOSTLY THERE ARE A LOT OF WHAT 
YOU WOULD THINK OF AS OFFICE 
PARKS, OFFICE BUILDINGS A FEW 
STORIES TALL, SURROUNDED BY 
PARKING LOTS
HOSPITALS.
FBI OFFICIALS ARE TELL US THAT 
THEY ARE IN TOUCH WITH LOCAL 
POLICE, MONITORING THE 
SITUATION. 
AGAIN, NOT ACTIVELY INVOLVED AT 
THIS POINT AS YOU WERE TALKING 
TO SOME SECURITY OFFICIALS AS 
WELL. WE'VE BEEN MONITORING 
GOOGLE, BECAUSE THEY OWN 
YOUTUBE, THEY HAVE ABOUT 1700 
EMPLOYEES AT THIS FACILITY, AND 
A NUMBER OF THEM WERE BEING 
FUNNELED OUT TO VARIOUS EXITS, 
SOME DOWN BY POLICE. 
SOME EMPLOYEES WERE OFF SITE, 
WE'VE BEEN MONITORING TWITTER 
AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. 
MANY HEARD GUNSHOTS, BUT NOBODY 
HAS BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM JUST 
HOW MANY SHOTS THEY HEARD. 
WE'RE CONTINUING TO MONITOR THE 
SITUATION. 
WE HAVE CREWS ON THE SCENE 
THERE AS WELL, GETTING IN PLACE 
RIGHT NOW TO GIVE US THE MOST 
ACCURATE AND UP TO DATE 
INFORMATION, BUT AGAIN, MORE 
THAN A HALF DOZEN TAKEN TO SAN 
FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL, AND 
ALSO TO STANFORD HEALTH. 
I'M GETTING NEW INFORMATION 
RIGHT NOW FROM THE SAN MATEO 
COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE, SAYING 
IN REGARDS TO THE ACTIVE 
SHOOTER SITUATION AT YOUTUBE 
HEADQUARTERS, THAT SAN BRUNO 
POLICE, THE CHIEF WILL MAKE A 
STATEMENT, IT LOOKS LIKE, IN 
ABOUT 5 MINUTES OR SO. 
SO WE'RE GOING TO WAIT FOR THAT 
IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, WE WILL 
HEAR FROM THE POLICE CHIEF, 
POLICE DEPARTMENT, THERE'S NOW 
A MEDIA STAGING AREA THERE AS 
WELL, SO WE SHOULD BE GETTING 
SOME UPDATED INFORMATION ON ALL 
OF THIS SINCE IT'S BEEN A VERY 
FLUID SITUATION FOR ABOUT THE 
LAST HOUR AND A HALF, REYNA? 
>> JAMIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 
THAT REPORT. 
>>> I WANT TO BRING IN JOHN 
BLACKSTONE, HE JUST ARRIVED TO 
SAN BRUNO. 
TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE THERE. 
>> Reporter: WHAT WE'RE SEEING 
IS A LARGE NUMBER OF YOUTUBE 
EMPLOYEES COMING OUT OF THE 
BILLION, BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE, 
LAW ENFORCEMENT GOING IN. 
MANY OF THESE EMPLOYEES WE SAW 
COMING OUT EARLY WHY HAD THEIR 
HANDS RAISED. 
THIS SEEMS TO BE A MORE CASUAL 
EXIT BUT A LARGE NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE WERE STILL IN THE 
BUILDING LOCKED DOWN. 
THERE'S ABOUT 1700 EMPLOYEES IN 
THE SWALLOWING YOUTUBE CAMPUS 
HERE. 
THERE'S A, WHAT WOULD APPEAR TO 
BE AN OVERWHELMING LAW 
ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE HERE. 
UP AROUND THE DOOR OF THE 
YOUTUBE BUILDING, YOU SEE THE 
FRONT DOOR OF THE BUILDING, LAW 
ENFORCEMENT THAT'S THERE, SEEMS 
TO BE CASUAL AT THIS TIME, NOT, 
NOT LOOKING FOR AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER, WE HAVE SEEN IN THE 
BUILDINGS, IN THE WINDOWS UP 
THERE, WE'VE SEEN POLICE 
OFFICERS, UNIFORMED POLICE 
OFFICERS APPEARING TO GO DOOR 
TO DOOR TO CLEAR THE BUILDING, 
AND THAT MAY BE HOW MORE 
EMPLOYEES ARE COMING OUT AS 
THEY CLEAR MORE SECTIONS OF 
THIS BUILDING SURE THEY HAVE 
THE WOUNDS, MAKING SURE -- 
WOUNDED. 
WE SAW EARLIER, MANY EMPLOYEES 
COMING UP WITH THEIR HANDS 
RAISED. 
HUGE LAW ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE 
AS YOU CAN SEE, AND WE KNOW 
THAT PATIENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN 
FROM HERE BY AMBULANCE TO SAN 
FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL, AND 
THE STANFORD MEDICAL CENTER. 
WE THINK ABOUT A HALF DOZEN TO 
SAN FRANCISCO, MAYBE FOUR OR 
FIVE TO STANFORD. 
REYNA? 
>> THANK YOU. 
REMARKABLE TO SEE THOSE PEOPLE 
WITH THEIR HANDS UP BEHIND YOU 
WHO HAVE BEEN COMING DOWN THAT 
STREET. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING 
US. 
I WANT TO BRING IN PAUL 
SWIOLAS. 
'S WE HEARD FROM JAMES ANY AND 
JOHN'S -- JAMIE AND JOHN'S 
REPORT, POLICE ARE STILL TRYING 
TO SECURITY THE PERIMETER, JUST 
THE STREAM OF PEOPLE COMING OUT 
WITH THEIR HANDS OFF, AND YOU 
SAID THAT'S AN INDICATION OF 
SOMETHING. 
>> YES. 
MOST CERTAINLY. 
THAT IS AN INDICATION THAT 
POLICE KNOW SHOULD DO NOT HAVE 
THE SHOOTER OR SHOOTERS AND THE 
SITUATION CONTAINED. 
SO AS YOU SEE PEOPLE COME UP, 
POLICE HAVE TO DO THIS. 
AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS THE OP -- 
OPTIC, AS WE SAW IN PARKLAND, 
THE SHOOTER WALKED OUT WITH THE 
STUDENT, SO POLICE ARE TRAINED 
TO MAKE SURE UNTIL THE 
SITUATION IS ENTIRELY 
CONTAINED, AND THE SHOOTER AND 
SHOOTERS HAVE BEEN MITIGATED, 
THEN UNTIL THEN, NOT UNTIL 
THEN, CAN THEY LET THIS 
SITUATION GO WITHOUT HAVING 
PEOPLE HANDS UP, AND PATTED 
DOWN. 
>> I WANT TO BRING IN RON 
HOSKO. 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT WE 
KNOW RIGHT NOW? 
>> THE ONE PIECE OF WHAT SEEMS 
TO BE ENCOURAGES NEWS IS WE 
DON'T SEE THE POLICE OR OTHER 
PEOPLE DUCKING FOR COVER. 
WE HAVEN'T HEARD ADDITIONAL 
SHOTS, CALLS OF SHOTS FIRED. 
SO WITH THAT, ONE WOULD THINK 
THAT EITHER THIS SITUATION HAS 
STABILIZED INSIDE, WHETHER THAT 
IS THE SUBJECT CONCEALING 
THEMSELVES WHILE POLICE HUNT 
FOR THEM, WHETHER THE SUBJECT 
OR POLICE HAVE NEUTRAL AISLED 
THIS SHOOTER, OR WHETHER THE 
PERSON HAS, YOU KNOW, WALKED 
OUT WITH A WEAPON OR WITHOUT. 
THIS SITUATION SEEMS TO BE 
STABILIZED JUST BECAUSE THERE 
DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE FRANTIC 
ACTIVITY AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD 
ANYMORE SHOTS OR CALLS OF SHOTS 
FIRED. 
SO THAT PART IS ENCOURAGING. 
BUT THE QUESTION IS, DO THEY 
KNOW WHO THIS IS? 
OR IS THIS A LONGER PURSUIT OF 
SOMEBODY WHO DID GET AWAY? 
WHAT ARE THE POLICE DOING, WHAT 
DO THEY KNOW RIGHT NOW? 
ARE THEY HUNTING THE PERSON OUT 
ASSIGNMENT THE PERIMETER 
BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHO IT IS? 
I THINK PAUL WAS TALKED ABOUT 
IT BEFORE, PART OF THE JOB, IS 
APART FROM HUNTING DOWN AN 
ACTIVE SHOOTER, IF THEY ARE 
OUTSIDE OF THIS PERIMETER, THE 
PART OF THE POLICE WORK IS TO 
PUT, PULL TOGETHER ALL THOSE 
LITTLE BITS OF INFORMATION THAT 
MAY LEAD TO THE IDENTITY SO 
THEY CAN BRING THIS PERSON INTO 
CUSTODY. 
SO WE DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S 
PROCEEDING RIGHT NOW, AND 
CLEARLY SOMETHING BAD HAS 
HAPPENED AT THIS FACILITY WHERE 
WE HEAR REPORTS OF THE INJURED, 
BUT RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T KNOW 
WHAT THE END GAME IS LOOKING 
LIKE. 
IS IT SUICIDE? 
IS IT SUICIDE BY COP? 
OR EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE WITH 
POLICE INSIDE AND THE 
SITUATION'S BEEN NEUTRALIZED OR 
IS SOMEBODY ON THE RUN? 
>>> AND THE FACT THAT THE 
CONNOR IS ON THE SCENE, WHAT -- 
CORONER IS ON THE SCENE, WHAT 
DOES THAT SUGGEST? 
>> IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS 
BEEN FATALLY INJURED, EVEN 
THOUGH IT'S THE POLICE ROLE TO 
DECLARE SOMEBODY DECEASED. 
YOU WILL KEEP THAT PERSON IN 
THE STATE THEY WERE FOUND SO 
THAT THE CORONER CAN COME TO 
THE SCENE AND DEE CLEAR 
SOMEBODY LEGALLY DEAD, AND THEN 
LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD BE DOING 
THEIR EVIDENCE COLLECT AND 
DOCUMENTATION WORK, AND SO IT 
COULD BE THAT FATALLY INJURED 
VICTIMS ARE LEFT IN PLACE FOR A 
PERIOD OF TIME WHILE THE 
INVESTIGATIVE WORK AND THE WORK 
OF THE CORONER -- INVESTIGATIVE 
. 
>> IT WILL BE NOT FAR FROM THIS 
AREA HERE. 
WE'RE GOING TO CARRY THAT LIVE 
HERE ON CBSN. 
WE'LL BRING THAT TO YOU. 
COMING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE 
SPOKESPERSON, SARAH HUCKABEE 
SANDERS, SHE HAD SAID THE 
PRESIDENT WAS BRIEFED AND ARE 
MONITORING THE HE SITUATION AT 
BRAN. 
WE WERE DISCUSSING THE SAN 
MATEO CORONER SAID THEY WERE 
CALLED TO THE SCENE. 
WE'RESEEING THE FOLKS WITH 
THEIR HANDS UP IN THE AIR, WHAT 
WE'VE BEEN WITNESSING THE PAST 
HOUR OR SO. 
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT WE 
KNOW AT THIS POINT? 
>> WELL, WHAT WE KNOW AT THIS 
POINT IS, WE'RE NOT HEARING 
FURTHER SHOTS, WHICH IS 
ENCOURAGING, BUT THE OTHER PART 
THEY'RE MOVING THE PERIMETER SO 
WHAT THAT TELLS US IS THERE'S 
STILL A SIGNIFICANT A 
INFORMATION WE JUST DON'T KNOW. 
THINK OF IT THIS WAY, THIS IS A 
HUGE BUILDING. 
I DON'T KNOW THE AMOUNT OF 
SQUARE FEET, BUT IT'S HUGE. 
POLICE NEED TO CLEAR THIS 
BUILDING. 
THERE ARE STILL SOULS IN THE 
BUILDING, AND A SHOOTER OR 
SHOOTERS UNACCOUNTED FOR. 
SO THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO 
METHOD ME -- METHODICALLY CLEAR 
THAT BUILDING. 
WE ARE INCORPORATING THE USE OF 
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WITH 
THE CAMERAS SO WE CAN TRY TO 
TRY TO IDENTIFY FREENESS 
CHICAGO ANY HOOTERS -- 
FORENSICALLY IDENTIFY THE 
SHOOTERS. POLICE ARE GOING TO 
START TO FINISH TO MOVE THROUGH 
-- CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH THE 
BUILDING, AT THE SAME TIME, TRY 
TO GET EYES IN THE BUILDING SO 
THEY CAN IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE 
THE SHOOTER OR SHOOTERS AT 
LARGE RIGHT NOW. 
>> AGAIN, WE'RE MONITORING THE 
SITUATION, ACTIVE SHOOTER AND 
YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS. 
IN THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES, WE 
EXPECT THE POLICE CHIEF TO AT 
THE TIME US WHAT THEY -- TELL 
US WHAT THEY KNOW, WHETHER THE 
SITUATION IS CONTAINED, IF 
THERE WERE ANY FATALITIES. 
WE EXPECT THAT TO START ANY 
MOMENT NOW, AND WILL BRING IT 
LIVE AS SOON AS IT BEGINS. 
AND NOW TO OUR COVERAGE FROM 
KPIX. 
>> WE'VE HEARD COMING FROM THIS 
AREA CONFIRMED -- BECAUSE AT 
LAST WORD, THERE WAS AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER ON CAMPUS SO THE HOPE 
IS THIS POLICE CHIEF CAN 
CONFIRM THAT'S NO LONGER THE 
CASE, THE PERSON OR PERSONS HAS 
BEEN KNEW NEUTRALIZED. 
POLICE TOOK TO SOCIAL MEDIA TO 
REPORT WHAT THEY WERE SEEING. 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK. 
>> GOING FOR A WALK. 
 GUNFIRE AT YOUTUBE. 
CALLING 911. 
>> THAT WAS A WOMAN TO WALK 
RIGHT BY THERE, POSTING THE 
VIDEO ON SNAPCHAT. 
SHE DESCRIBED WHAT SHE SAW. 
PANIC IN HER VOICE, OUT OF 
BREATH AS WELL. 
HEARING SHOTS FIRED NEAR THE 
PLACE OF BUSINESS. 
OTHER USERS POSTING SNAPS 
SHOWING THEIR VIEWS OF FIRST 
RESPONDERS WHO ARE ON THIS 
SCENE. 
THIS IS SIMILAR TO WHAT CHOPPER 
5 HAS BEEN SHOWING YOU, PEOPLE 
BEING ESCORTED OUT ON THE 
SIDEWALK AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR 
SCREEN, AND HEAVY POLICE 
PRESENCE, LAW ENFORCEMENT, 
VEHICLES, SEVERAL VANS AND 
POLICE CARS OUT THERE AND 
SEVERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT 
AGENCIES ALL OUT THERE, 
INCLUDING THE ATF, TRYING TO 
GET A HANDLE OF WHAT'S GOING 
ON, AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE 
WITH THEIR HANDS UP AS LAW 
ENFORCEMENT TRIES TO GET THEM 
OUT, AND SURE THE SHOOTER 
DOESN'T WALK OUT WITHOUT THEM 
KNOWING. 
SO THAT'S ANOTHER TASK OF THIS 
AT HAND, TRYING TO GET HUNDREDS 
OF PEOPLE OUT OF FROM WHILE 
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO DID 
THIS. 
UNCONFIRMED REPORTS OF A FEMALE 
SHOOTER AND MALE, THAT'S WHAT 
POLICE MAY BE LOOKING FOR, BUT 
THE POLICE CHIEF WILL HAVE MORE 
UPDATED INFORMATION. 
WE DO WANT TO HEAR FROM THEM TO 
PROVIDE THAT OFFICIAL WORD 
BECAUSE THAT COULD HELP CALM A 
LOT OF PEOPLE'S NERVES. 
THIS IS A WIDER VIEW, A MASSIVE 
COMPLEX THERE. 
1700 PEOPLE IN THE YOUTUBE 
HEADQUARTER ALONE, BUT SEVERAL 
HUNDRED NEARBY AT THE BUSY 
OFFICES, ON TUESDAY, AT 1:00. 
PEOPLE WERE GOING FOR THEIR 
WALK POSSIBLY, POSSIBLY GOING 
TO LUNCH, THERE'S A NEARBY 
SHOPPING CENTER WHERE PEOPLE GO 
TO EAT, AND AROUND 1:00, THAT'S 
WHAT MANY WERE DOING, AND THIS 
OCCURRED -- RIGHT THERE AT THE 
YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS. 
>> THE BIG QUESTION FOR A LOT 
OF PEOPLE IS THE INJURIES, THE 
CASUALTIES FROM THIS SITUATION, 
AND THAT'S THE INFORMATION WE 
DON'T HAVE, BUT WE CAN SAY 
THERE ARE BEEN MULTIPLE 
INJURIES, LOT OF FOLKS SENT TO 
SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL, 
NO NUMBER AND WE KNOW FOUR OR 
FIVE PEOPLE WERE SENT VIA 
AMBULANCE TO STANFORD HOSPITAL 
TO THE SOUTH, SO SOME OF THOSE 
EMERGENCY VEHICLES GOING NORTH, 
SOUTH SOUTH -- SOME SOUTH, AND 
THE FACT THAT THE CORONER VAN 
HAS BEEN CALLED INDICATES THERE 
COULD HAVE BEEN AT LEAST ONE 
DEATH IN THIS SHOOTING THAT 
CURLED AT ABOUT 1:00 P.M. 
WE -- OCCURRED AT 1:00 P.M. 
WE HAVE REACTION FROM JACKIE 
SPEAR WHO REPRESENTS THE AREA 
IN CONGRESS. 
SHE TWEETED, I AM SHOCKED AND 
SADDENED TO HEAR ABOUT ANOTHER 
MASS SHOOTING, THIS ONE AT 
YOUTUBE IN MY DISTRICT. 
I'M FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS AND 
SENDING PRAYERS TO THE VICTIMS 
AND SURVIVORS. 
WE MISTAKE ACTION, 
#ENDGUNVIOLENCE. 
SHE IS VERY FOCAL KNOCK -- 
VOCAL. 
THIS IS PART OF THE 
CONVERSATION, THE PRO GUN 
CONTROL VIEW SHARED BY MANY OF 
CALIFORNIA'S POLITICS AND 
REPRESENTATIVES AND AGAIN, HERE 
IS WHAT WE SEE HAPPENING IN OUR 
ON BACKYARD. 
THIS IS INFORMATION AND 
EXPERIENCE THAT THEY WILL TAKE 
INTO THEIR -- 
>> WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE 
ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION AT 
YOUTUBE. 
WE CAN CONFIRM WHAT PAUL HAS 
BEEN REPORTING, A FEMALE 
úSUSPE 
I WANT TO BRING IT IS A FEMALE 
SHOOTER THAT HAS BEEN KILLED.  
>> WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 
VALIDATE EVERYTHING BEFORE WE 
SAY ANYTHING. 
THIS CAME FROM TWO RELIABLE 
SOURCES REENA, ON THE GROUND 
AND SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER. 
I AM NOT SURPRISED. 
WHAT I AM SURPRISED THAT, REENA 
, AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH 
WHAT WAS SAID EARLIER, 
STATISTICALLY, WHEN WE LOOK AT 
THE WORKPLACE SHOOTING 
SITUATIONS, FAR ABOVE ANYTHING 
ELSE IS ACTIVE SHOOTERS BEING 
MEN. 
I BELIEVE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE 
THIS IS GOING TO HAVE AN AWFUL 
LOT TO DO WITH EITHER A 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISSUE OR 
FORMER EMPLOYEE. 
>> I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU IF 
THAT WAS POSSIBLY THE CASE. 
>> THAT IS WHAT I AM HEARING 
RIGHT NOW. 
I BELIEVE, BASED ON WHAT WE 
HAVE BEEN TOLD SO FAR, IN MY 
YEARS OF DOING THIS --  
>> -- PAUL, I WANT TO INTERRUPT 
YOU FOR JUST A SECOND. 
I APOLOGIZE. 
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU TO A 
PRESS CONFERENCE BEING HELD BY 
SAN BRUNO. 
LET'S LISTEN IN. 
>> POLICE ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 
12:48 AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN A 
SEARCH FOR A POSSIBLE SHOOTER 
OR SUSPECT. 
UPON ARRIVAL, OFFICERS 
ENCOUNTERED NUMEROUS EMPLOYEES 
FLEEING FROM THE BUILDING. 
IT WAS VERY CHAOTIC. 
ONE VICTIM WAS IMPAIRED WITH A 
GUNSHOT WOUND TOWARD THE 
BEGINNING -- FRONT OF THE 
BUSINESS AS WE ARRIVED. 
WHILE CONDUCTING A SEARCH OF 
THE PREMISES, OFFICERS LOCATED 
A SECOND INDIVIDUAL WITH A 
GUNSHOT WOUND THAT APPEARS TO 
POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN SELF-
INFLICTED. 
WE ARE STILL WORKING ON 
CONFIRMING THAT. 
TWO ADDITIONAL VICTIMS WERE 
LOCATED SEVERAL MINUTES LATER 
WITH THE EXTENT OF ALL OF THE 
INJURIES OF OUR VICTIMS, THEY 
ARE UNKNOWN RIGHT NOW. 
THEY WERE ALL TRANSPORTED FOR 
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE. 
WE HAVE FOUR VICTIMS WHO HAVE 
ALL BEEN TRANSPORTED FOR 
MOONSHOT -- GUNSHOT RELATED 
INJURIES. 
WE HAVE ONE SUSPECT -- SUBJECT 
-
INFLICTED WOUND. 
WE BELIEVE THAT TO BE THE 
SHOOTER BUT WE ARE STILL 
FOLLOWING UP ON MATT. 
MULTIPLE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
AGENCIES HAVE RESPONDED TO 
ASSIST. WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL 
FOR EVERYONE'S HELP AND 
ASSISTANCE. 
WE COULD NOT ACCOMPLISH THIS 
WITHOUT EVERYONE'S HELP. 
THIS IS AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION 
AND ACTIVE EVENTS. 
NUMEROUS LAW ENFORCEMENT 
PERSONNEL FROM NUMEROUS 
DIFFERENT LOCAL AGENCIES ARE 
STILL CONDUCTING A SEARCH OF 
THE BUSINESS TO MAKE SURE IT'S 
CLEAR. 
WE CONDUCTED A QUICK AND 
IMMEDIATE SEARCH OF THE PREMISES
WITH FIRST OFFICERS ARRIVING 
PER THE ACTIVE SHOOTER 
PROTOCOL. 
NOW WE ARE GOING THROUGH WITH A 
METHODICAL, SLOW SEARCH TO MAKE 
SURE WE COVER ALL BASES. 
THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR YOU AT 
THIS TIME. 
WE HOPE TO HAVE SOMETHING A 
LITTLE LATER. 
I CANNOT GIVE YOU THE TIME OF 
THE NEXT PRESS UPDATE. 
WE WILL PUT THAT OUT AS SOON AS 
WE HAVE INFORMATION. 
I'M SORRY?  
>> Reporter: [ INAUDIBLE 
QUESTION ]  
>> I CANNOT CONFIRM THAT. 
IT'S A FEMALE.  
>> Reporter: [ INAUDIBLE 
QUESTION ]  
>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT 
THEY HAVE BEEN TRANSPORTED AND 
BEING TREATED FOR INJURIES THAT 
ARE TREATABLE. 
WE ARE HOPING FOR THE BEST, 
OBVIOUSLY. 
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE 
BUILDING HAS BEEN EVACUATED. 
THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE 
IMMEDIATE AREA. 
WE ARE OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO 
CONTACT A LARGE AMOUNT OF 
PEOPLE TO TRY TO IDENTIFY AND 
GAIN INFORMATION FROM WITNESSES 
AT THE SCENE. 
YOU CAN IMAGINE; IT'S A 
MONUMENTAL TASK WITH ALL OF THE 
EMPLOYEES THAT WORK INSIDE THE 
BUILDING.  
>> Reporter: CAN YOU TELL US 
ABOUT   
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT 
INFORMATION. 
I'M SORRY. 
I HAVEN'T TAKEN INVENTORY. 
THERE ARE NUMEROUS AGENCIES. 
WE WORK WELL WITH OUR 
NEIGHBORING PARTNERS AND WE ARE 
GRATEFUL THEY ARE HERE, BUT 
THERE'S A LOT OF THEM. 
I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WE DID 
LOCATE A VICTIM WITH WHAT WE 
BELIEVE TO BE A SELF-INFLICTED 
GUNSHOT WOUND, A FEMALE. 
THE INVESTIGATION IS STILL 
ONGOING BEFORE WE CAN PUT THE 
PIECES TOGETHER.  
>> Reporter: NO ONE?  
>> I HAVE NO ONE --  
>> Reporter: GNAWED?  
>> WE HAVE NO INFORMATION TO 
INDICATE THAT THERE IS SOMEONE 
ELSE THERE.  
>> Reporter:   
>> WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A GROUP 
OF PEOPLE WE WANT TO REACH OUT 
TO AND INTERVIEW. 
WE ARE TRYING TO DO THIS AS 
ORDERLY AS WE CAN. 
IT'S A PRETTY HECTIC SCENARIO 
SO IT'S A TASK.  
>> Reporter: MANY PEOPLE NEEDED 
TO BE EVACUATED?  
>> WE BELIEVE -- MY 
UNDERSTANDING IS THE BUILDING 
HAS BEEN EVACUATED A FEW 
HUNDRED PEOPLE.  
>> Reporter: [ INAUDIBLE 
QUESTION ]  
>> I HAVE NO IDEA. 
I DON'T KNOW THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
AT ALL. 
I DON'T WANT TO ELIMINATE ANY 
POSSIBILITY. 
I DON'T KNOW THAT FOR SURE. 
LIKE I SAID, THIS IS STILL 
ACTIVE. 
WE ARE STILL INVESTIGATING AS I 
AM SPEAKING WITH YOU. 
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS WE 
SIMPLY DON'T KNOW.  
>> Reporter: [ INAUDIBLE 
QUESTION ]  
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT 
INFORMATION. 
I WILL TRY TO GET YOU AN UPDATE 
AS SOON AS WE CAN, ONCE WE KNOW 
MORE. 
I THINK I'M GIVING ALMOST 
EVERYTHING WE KNOW AT THIS 
úPOI 
WHEN WE KNOW -- I DON'T WANT TO 
GIVE YOUR TIME BECAUSE I MAY 
NOT HAVE A LOT FOR YOU -- WHEN 
WE CAN IDENTIFY A TIME IS 
APPROPRIATE TO UPDATE YOU 
AGAIN, WE WILL DO THAT 
IMMEDIATELY. 
WE WILL PROBABLY PUT THAT OUT 
THROUGH OUR MEDIA LIST AND 
SOCIAL MEDIA.  
>> Reporter: WE UNDERSTAND ONE 
EMPLOYEE HAD BADGES AND COULD 
ACCESS MULTIPLE PARTS OF THE 
BUILDING. 
DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION 
ABOUT THAT? 
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION 
AT THIS TIME.  
>> Reporter: [ INAUDIBLE 
QUESTION ]  
>> WE ARE NOT EVEN AT THAT 
POINT YET. 
WE ARE STILL TRYING TO ADDRESS 
THE SITUATION IN FRONT OF US. 
I WILL GET YOU SOME MORE 
INFORMATION IN A FEW MINUTES. 
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. 
THAT'S ALL I HAVE. 
AGAIN, I WILL GET BACK TO YOU 
AS SOON AS I CAN. 
>> SAN BRUNO POLICE GIVING US 
AN UPDATE OF THE SITUATION, 
CONFIRMING THAT FOUR VICTIMS 
WERE REMOVED FROM THE SCENE AND 
IN FACT THAT THE SUSPECT IS 
DEAD. 
THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER IS THAT. 
CBS NEWS HAS CONFIRMED THAT THE 
SUSPECTED SHOOTER IS FEMALE. 
POLICE DID SAY THAT THE PERSON, 
ONE VICTIM, DID HAVE A SELF-
INFLICTED GUNSHOT WOUND. 
THAT VICTIM IS FEMALE. 
I WANT TO BRING IN CBS NEWS 
SECURITY ANALYST PAUL VIOLLIS 
WAS JOINING US BY PHONE. 
THIS SEEMED TO BE A WORKPLACE 
HOSTILITY TYPE OF SITUATION TO 
YOU. 
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT MORE.  
>> Reporter: BUT IT CERTAINLY 
APPEARS THAT WAY, BASED ON WHAT 
WE ARE TOLD SO FAR. 
HISTORY BEING WHAT IT IS, IT 
REPEATS ITSELF. 
BASED ON THE FACT THAT WHEN IT 
OCCURRED, WHERE IT OCCURRED, 
THE TIME OF DAY IT OCCURRED, 
WOULD SPELL ONE OF TWO THINGS, 
A CURRENT OR FORMER EMPLOYEE 
úT 
TYPE OF REVENGE. 
THE OTHER PART OF THIS, WHICH I 
FIRMLY BELIEVE HAS A HIGHER 
PROBABILITY BECAUSE IT'S A 
FEMALE SHOOTER, IT'S HIGHLY 
UNLIKELY STATISTICALLY, SOME 
TYPE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
RELATED SCENARIO. 
THOSE OF THE TWO THINGS AS THIS 
UNVEILS MORE IN THE HOURS TO 
COME, I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE 
ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT.  
>> CBS NEWS IS CONFIRMING THAT 
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SAY 
THE FBI IS NOW ON THE SCENE 
ASSISTING BULLIES. 
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?  
>> Reporter: THAT THEY ARE 
GOING TO START BREAKING DOWN, 
FROM THE BEHAVIORAL SIDE, THE 
SHOOTER AND THE THE COLLECTION 
OF INFORMATION, WHAT WAS KNOWN 
AND WHAT WAS FORESEEABLE. 
WHO ELSE MIGHT HAVE HAD 
INFORMATION FROM THE FORENSIC 
SIDE? EXPERIENCE WOULD BE 
BROUGHT TO BEAR WITH THE 
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. 
THAT REALLY SHOWS THAT THE 
COLLABORATION IS BEING USED AND 
NEEDED -- THAT IS BEING USED 
AND IS NEEDED IN THIS SITUATION.
>> PAUL, WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS 
THAT OVERWHELMINGLY, IT'S 
ALWAYS A MALE SHOOTER?  
>> Reporter: I CAN TELL YOU I 
HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 38 
YEARS. 
UNEQUIVOCALLY, IT'S THE WAY 
THAT, FROM A BEHAVIORAL SIDE, 
THE WAY THAT MEN AND WOMEN 
THINK. 
WOMEN ARE MUCH MORE RATIONAL, 
BELIEVE IT OR NOT. 
THEY DON'T HESITATE TO SEEK 
OTHERS TO RESOLVE CONFLICT. 
MEN ARE MUCH MORE SPONTANEOUS 
AND IMPETUOUS AND FEEL THEY 
NEED TO RESOLVE IT THEMSELVES. 
I THINK THE MALE EGO KICKS IN 
FAR MORE OFTEN. 
THAT'S WHY YOU WILL FIND, I 
TRULY BELIEVE THAT'S WHY WE 
FIND MORE -- FAR MORE MEN 
PERPETRATING ACTS OF VIOLENCE 
THEN WE DO WOMEN. 
>> THAT'S A FASCINATING TAKE, 
PAUL. 
IF YOU COULD STICK WITH US, I 
WANT TO BRING IN JAMIE YUCCAS 
FROM LOS ANGELES. 
WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW, JAMIE? 
ED REENA, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU 
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU TWO 
WERE JUST DISCUSSING. 
WE DUG INTO SOME INFORMATION TO 
SEE HOW MANY FEMALE SHOOTERS 
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN MASS 
SHOOTINGS. 
IN 2006 AND EXPOSED THE WORKER  
HAD A HISTORY OF MENTAL ILLNESS 
AND KILLED SIX OTHER POSTAL 
WORKERS IN NEW MEXICO. 
IN 2014 IT WAS A 44-YEAR-OLD 
WOMAN WHO OPENED FIRE ON A 
TRIBAL MEETING, NATIVE AMERICAN 
TRIBAL MEETING, KILLING FOUR 
PEOPLE. 
AS YOU MAY REMEMBER IN 
CALIFORNIA, THERE WAS SAN 
BERNARDINO BACK IN DECEMBER 
2015 WHERE ONE OF THE SUSPECTS 
IN THAT SHOOTING WAS FEMALE. 
SHE AND HER HUSBAND WERE ON 
SCENE IN SAN BERNARDINO FOR 
RATCHETING. 
IT IS VERY RARE. 
WE DUG INTO THE STATISTICS FOR 
YOU. 
ACCORDING TO MOTHER JONES 
MAGAZINE WHO HAS KEPT A 
DATABASE ON MASS SHOOTINGS 
SINCE 1980, THE INFORMATION WE 
KNOW AT THIS POINT IS A LOT OF 
WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN REPORTING. 
WE WERE LISTENING TO THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE THAT THE POLICE 
CHIEF AND -- SAN BRUNO CHIEF ED 
BARBERINI, THAT HE SAID THEY 
STARTED IMMEDIATELY ON THE 
SCENE, ENCOUNTEED ONE VICTIM 
IS A WALKED INTO THE DOOR. 
WE KNOW THAT THREE OTHER 
VICTIMS WERE ALSO TRANSPORTED 
TO THE HOSPITAL, A LITTLE 
EARLIER. 
WE KNOW THAT AT LEAST TWO OF 
THOSE VICTIMS HAVE GONE TO THE 
HOSPITAL. 
STANFORD HOSPITAL AND SAN 
FRANCISCO GENERAL BOTH SAID 
THEY WERE TAKING AND VICTIMS. 
THERE COULD BE OTHERS THAT HAVE 
BEEN TAKEN IN. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR 
THOSE NUMBERS AS THEY COME OUT. 
NOW THEY ARE METHODICALLY GOING 
THROUGH THE OFFICE BUILDING TO 
MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET 
EVERYBODY OUT. 
WHEN WE LOOKED INTO SOME OF THE 
RESEARCH, THERE'S ABOUT 1700 
EMPLOYEES ON ANY GIVEN DAY. 
THAT COULD FLUCTUATE. 
WATCHING TO SEE WHEN THIS SCENE 
IS ACTUALLY CLEAR AND WE ARE 
STILL WAITING FOR INFORMATION 
TO COME IN AS THE SHERIFF SAID. 
THIS IS A VERY FLUID SITUATION. 
>> JAMIE YUCCAS, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH FOR THAT FASCINATING TAKE 
ON THOSE NUMBERS. 
I WANT TO KNOW TAKE YOU TO OUR 
SAN FRANCISCO STATION, KPIX, 
WHO IS FOLLOWING THIS ENTIRE 
AFTERMATH. 
THEY ARE CURRENTLY GOING 
THROUGH. 
THERE ARE SO MANY CUBICLES AND 
OFFICES ON HALLWAY THEY HAVE TO 
SEARCH. 
THEY ARE DOING THAT NOW. 
THAT IS QUITE A TASK. 
YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS AND 
ADJACENT BUSINESSES WHERE THEY 
SAW TWO OTHER VICTIMS. 
THEY ARE NOW GOING TO ALL OF 
THOSE BUILDINGS TO MAKE SURE 
THAT PEOPLE GET OUT SAFELY AND 
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE INVOLVED IN 
THIS SHOOTING.  
>> Reporter: WE HAVE ANDREA LIVE
ON SCENE AND SHE HAS BEEN 
SPEAKING WITH SOME OF THE 
PEOPLE THAT WERE INSIDE OF THE 
BUILDING WHEN THE SHOOTING 
BROKE OUT. 
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?  
>> Reporter: I SPOKE TO 2 
ENGINEERS THAT WORK AT YOUTUBE. 
ONE WAS IN THE CENTER OF THE 
BUILDING WHEN HE BELIEVES THE 
GUNFIRE BROKE OUT. HE CAME 
OUTSIDE. 
HE THOUGHT IT WAS A FIRE ALARM. 
THE FIRE ALARMS WENT OFF. 
HE GRABBED HIS BRIEFCASE AND 
RAN OUTSIDE. 
ESAU SOMEBODY WITH WHAT HE 
BELIEVED IT TO BE A GUNSHOT 
WUND AND BLOOD COMING OUT OF 
HIS STOMACH. 
THE SECOND ENGINEER I SPOKE TO 
SAID HE THOUGHT IT WAS BALLOONS 
POPPING AT FIRST. 
HE THEN QUICKLY REALIZED IT WAS 
GUNSHOTS AND HE RAN INSIDE AND 
HELD THE DOOR OPEN FOR A FEW 
OTHERS AND HE SAW SOME PEOPLE 
INSIDE THAT WERE CROUCHING 
BENEATH PICNIC TABLES AND THERE 
WAS A BODY IN FRONT DOOR SO HE 
COULD NOT JOIN THEM. 
WE WRAPPED UP WITH THE POLICE 
CHIEF A FEW MINUTES AGO. THE 
CALLS INITIALLY CAME IN AT 
12:44 THIS AFTERNOON. 
THEY WERE ON SCENE AT 12:40 A. 
THEY SAY WHEN THEY ARRIVED ON 
CAMPUS ON CHERRY AVENUE IN SAN 
BRUNO, THERE WAS ONE PERSON 
WITH A GUNSHOT WOUND WHO WAS 
STANDING IN FRONT OF THE DOOR, 
LAYING DOWN IN FRONT OF THE 
DOOR. 
THEY FOUND A SECOND BODY WHICH 
THEY BELIEVE WAS THE SHOOTER, A 
FEMALE WITH A SELF-INFLICTED 
GUNSHOT WOUND. 
THEY THEN FOUND TWO MORE 
PEOPLE. 
THOSE PEOPLE HAVE ALL BEEN 
TRANSPORTED. 
THEY BELIEVE THE SHOOTER IN 
THIS CASE WAS A FEMALE WHO DID 
IN FACT SHOOT HERSELF AND KILL 
HERSELF. 
THEY ARE STILL DOING A FLOOR BY 
FLOOR SECONDARY -- SECONDARY 
SEARCH TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY 
OTHER EVIDENCE. 
THEY ARE GOING CAUTIOUSLY AND 
SLOWLY TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING 
IS TAKEN CARE OF OUT HERE.  
>> Reporter: THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH. 
LIVE AT YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS, 
GOING TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO 
HOPEFULLY SOME MORE PEOPLE THAT 
WERE INSIDE THAT AREA, 
TERRIFYING STORIES. 
1700 PEOPLE WORK IN THAT 
BUILDING. 
AUNDREA SAID SOME PEOPLE SAID IT
SOUNDED LIKE BALLOONS POPPING. 
OTHERS KNEW RIGHT AWAY THAT IT 
WAS THE SHOOTER AND THAT'S THE 
CLIMATE THAT WE ARE IN AT THIS 
POINT WITH THE NUMBER OF MASS 
SHOOTINGS GOING ON ACROSS THE 
U.S. RECENTLY. AT THIS POINT, 
THE SEARCH CONTINUES AS WE TAKE 
A WIDER VIEW RIGHT NOW FROM 
CHOPPER 5 OF THIS YOUTUBE 
CAMPUS IN SAN BRUNO. IT'S 
LARGELY AN INDUSTRIAL AREA WITH 
A LOT OF OFFICES. ON THE 
OUTSIDE, AS YOU COULD SEE, A 
LOT OF RESIDENTIAL AREAS, LOTS 
OF HOMES IN THAT AREA. 
THE STREETS ARE SHUT DOWN. 
THERE'S A LOT OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, FEDERAL AGENCIES 
SUCH AS THE ATF THERE AS WELL. 
THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE THIS 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> AS YOU MENTIONED, SEVERAL úE 
TERRIFYING TO HEAR SHOTS FIRED 
AT THEIR PLACE OF WORK. 
LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT SOME OF 
THE WITNESSES HAVE DESCRIBED.  
>> I DIDN'T HEAR ANY SHOTS. 
I THINK THEY WERE FIRED WHILE I 
WAS STILL IN THE BUILDING. 
I WORK IN THE MIDSECTION OF THE 
BUILDING. 
IF SHOTS WERE FIRED, I WOULDN'T 
HAVE HEARD IT'S.  
>> Reporter: AND YOU SAID IT 
WAS SOMEONE WITH AN ASSAULT 
WEAPON? 
TO MAKE SOMEBODY ELSE SAID HE 
HAD A PISTOL. 
I AM NOT SURE. 
I NEVER SAW THE GUN. 
I CAN'T CONFIRM ANYTHING ABOUT 
THE WEAPON THAT HE HAD. 
ALL I CAN CONFIRM IS SOMEONE 
APPEAR TO HAVE A BULLET WOUND 
IN HIS STOMACH AND HE WAS 
LAYING ON THE OUTSIDE COURTYARD 
AND WASN'T MOVING.  
>> Reporter: WHAT KIND OF 
SECURITY DOES YOUTUBE HAVE?  
>> JUST TO CLARIFY, THE 
INFORMATION WE HAVE RIGHT NOW 
IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM 
WHAT HE JUST MENTIONED. 
HE'S DEALING WITH THIS IN THE 
HEAT OF THE MOMENT. 
THE POLICE CHIEF DID SAY THAT 
THERE WAS A FEMALE WHO ENDED UP 
DEAD FROM A GUNSHOT WOUND, SELF-
INFLICTED GUNSHOT WOUND. 
THREE VICTIMS, PEOPLE THAT WERE 
ALSO SHOT IN THAT AREA. THEY 
HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THAT THERE 
MAY OR MAY NOT BE ANOTHER 
SHOOTER. 
THEY HAVE NOT ELIMINATED THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT THERE COULD BE 
SOMEONE ELSE INVOLVED IN ALL OF 
THIS. 
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE NOW GOING 
TO GO THROUGH EVERY DOOR, 
CLOSET, OFFICE, IN THIS MASSIVE 
COMPLEX, TO CLEAR THAT AREA. 
THEY WANT THE EMPLOYEES OUT AND 
SAVE, BUT THEY ALSO NEED TO 
CONFIRM WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS 
OVER, WHETHER OR NOT THAT 
PERSON WHO DIED FROM THE SELF-
INFLICTED WOUND WAS THE ONLY 
SHOOTER INVOLVED OR NOT. 
AT THIS MOMENT, THAT IS WHAT WE 
KNOW. 
THREE VICTIMS, AT A LOCAL 
HOSPITAL, AND ONE PERSON, A 
FEMALE DEAD FROM A SELF-
THEY ARE LOOKING INTO WHETHER 
OR NOT THAT WAS THE ONLY 
SHOOTER INVOLVED OR IF THAT IN 
FACT WAS THE SHOOTER.  
>> AND THE THREE PEOPLE THAT 
WERE SHOT WERE TAKEN TO SAN 
FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL. 
ONE IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION 
AND ONE IS IN SERIOUS 
CONDITION. 
ONE'S CONDITION IS UNKNOWN 
RIGHT NOW. 
AS FAR AS WE UNDERSTAND, FOUR 
PEOPLE WERE SHOT THIS AFTERNOON 
AT YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS. 
NOW THEY ARE MENTIONING THE 
SEARCH THAT'S ONGOING. 
CHIEF ED BARBERINI DISCUSSED 
THIS AND SAID IT WAS A 
MONUMENTAL TASK AS THEY TRY TO 
CLEAR THE BUILDING AND MAKE 
SURE THERE IS NO PRESENT 
DANGER. 
AS FOR ONE OF THE PEOPLE TAKEN 
AWAY, THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY 
VIDEOS THAT HAVE BEEN POSTED ON 
SNAPCHAT. 
THIS WOMAN POSTING AFTER SELF 
EVACUATING. 
WE ARE NOT ABLE TO HEAR HER 
VOICE RIGHT NOW BUT YOU ARE 
LOOKING AT SOME OF THE OTHER 
VIDEOS WE HAVE SEEN COMING IN. 
AS FOR THE PEOPLE, AS I WAS 
SAYING, THAT WERE EVACUATED 
FROM THE BUILDING, THEY ARE 
BEING PUT INTO GROUPS, PATTED 
DOWN TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T 
HAVE ANY WEAPONS ON THEM, AND 
AT THAT POINT LAW ENFORCEMENT 
ARE DECIDING IF THEY WERE 
SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY ARE GOING 
TO HAVE VIABLE INFORMATION IN 
THIS INVESTIGATION. 
THOSE PEOPLE WILL THEN BE 
SEPARATED AND INTERVIEWED AS 
PART OF THIS INVESTIGATION. 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A MASSIVE 
AMOUNT OF PEOPLE. 
AT THIS POINT, LAW ENFORCEMENT 
DOESN'T WANT TO LET ANYBODY GET 
AWAY OR GET OUT OF THAT AREA 
BEFORE POSSIBLY GETTING SOME 
INFORMATION FOR THIS 
INVESTIGATION. 
OU ARE DEALING  
ENFORCEMENT ON SEVERAL LEVELS 
WERE HERE. 
THE CITY OF BRUNO, THE COUNTY, 
THE STATE, AND FEDERAL AGENTS, 
RIGHT NOW ALL ON SCENE TRYING 
TO COORDINATE THE RESPONSE TO 
WHAT IS STILL BEING DESCRIBED 
AS AN ACTIVE INCIDENT AT 
YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS. IT IS 
PRETTY EASY TO JUDGE FROM THE 
POLICE CHIEF'S TONE THAT HE 
DOESN'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY 
APPARENT DANGER AT THIS POINT. 
HE JUST SAID HE ISN'T AVAILABLE 
-- ABLE TO ELIMINATE THE 
POSSIBILITY.  
>> AND MULTIPLE SHOTS WERE 
HEARD. 
WE NOW KNOW THAT FOUR VICTIMS 
WERE INVOLVED IN THIS. 
THREE OF THEM ARE BEING TREATED 
AT THE HOSPITAL. 
THIS WILL HOPEFULLY PROVIDE A 
LITTLE BIT OF RELIEF. 
FOR SO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE 
LOVED ONES WORKING AT THE 
YOUTUBE HEADQUARTERS, THEY WANT 
TO KNOW WHO THE VICTIMS ARE, IF 
THE RELATIVES AND FRIENDS ARE 
DOING OKAY. 
WE HAVE HEARD THAT TEMPERANCE 
IS THE GENERAL WILL PROVIDE AN 
UPDATE AT 330 THIS AFTERNOON, 
AN UPDATE ON THE VICTIMS. 
RIGHT NOW IT DOES APPEAR THAT 
THE THREE VICTIMS WERE SHOT ARE 
BEING TREATED. HOPEFULLY, THEY 
WILL GET THROUGH THIS AND THOSE 
DOCTORS ARE WORKING TO MAKE 
SURE THAT THEY SURVIVE THIS. 
RIGHT NOW, AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT 
NOW, AT SOME OF THE ENTRANCES, 
THERE ARE SEVERAL DOORWAYS TO 
ACCESS THIS BUILDING AND THEY 
HAVE TO CLEAR IT ALL OUT AND 
MAKE SURE THAT THIS HAS ENDED, 
THAT THE SHOOTER IS IN FACT THE 
PERSON WHO WAS FOUND DEAD FROM 
A SELF INFLICTED GUNSHOT WOUND. 
THEY HAVE NOT ELIMINATED THE 
POSSIBILITY OF THERE BEING MORE 
PEOPLE. 
THEY ARE STILL SEARCHING FOR 
SOMEONE ELSE. 
EMPLOYEES IN THAT AREA, OF 
COURSE, ARE CALMLY WALKING OUT 
AS WE HAD BEEN NOTICING FROM 
OUR CHOPPER 5 LIVE LOOK. 
>>CALMLY IS ALL RELATIVE. 
AS YOU LOOK AT THIS VIEW OF THE 
YOUTUBE CAMPUS, IT'S VERY CLOSE 
TO 280 AND 380 IN SAN BRUNO. 
A LOT OF STREETS ARE CLOSED 
DOWN IN THAT AREA. 
CONTINUE TO AVOID A RIAZ POLICE 
WORK THROUGH THEIR 
INVESTIGATION ON THE SCENE. 
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 
MONITOR THE SITUATION HERE IN 
THE KPIX 5 NEWSROOM. 
WE HAVE REPORTERS ON THE SCENE. 
WE ARE GOING TO BRINGING MORE 
COVERAGE ON OUR FACEBOOK PAGE 
ONLINE. 
AND AS SOON AS THERE'S ANY 
UPDATES WE WILL BRING YOU BACK 
TO KPIX LIVE.
