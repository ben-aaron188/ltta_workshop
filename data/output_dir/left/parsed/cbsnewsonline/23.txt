úRESPONSE TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 
FINAL STATE OF THE UNION IN 
2016 IN WHICH SHE WAS VERY 
CRITICAL OF THE THEN CANDIDATE 
TRUMP AND HIS RHETORIC, YOU 
KNOW, SLAMMING AGAINST 
DIVISION. 
SHE'S OF COURSE THE DAUGHTER OF 
IMMIGRANTS. 
SO SHE'S VERY MUCH PLAYED THAT 
UP. 
AND SO WHEN SHE TOOK THIS JOB 
AS U.N. AMBASSADOR, IT WAS 
SURPRISING TO SOME BECAUSE OF 
HER HISTORY WITH TRUMP. 
BUT THEY HAD MADE AMENDS AND 
SHE HAD BEEN SAYING THAT SHE 
WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIM WHEN SHE 
NEEDED TO BE AND SHE WASN'T 
AFRAID TO ALSO VOICE HER 
CRITICISMS OF HIM. 
>> SO, CAITLIN, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
HAS TWEETED OUT A BIG 
ANNOUNCEMENT WITH MY FRIEND 
NIKKI HALEY. 
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT TYPE 
OF WORDING, THERE ARE QUESTIONS 
SWIRLING WILL SHE BE 
REASSIGNED. 
SHE DECLINED TO COMMENT WHEN 
SHE WAS ASKED THAT BY A REUTERS 
REPORTER ON THE WAY INTO THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
BUT AS YOU MENTIONED, THEIR 
RELATIONSHIP OVER THE YEARS HAS 
BEEN TUMULTUOUS, AND THEN 
THEY'VE COME TOGETHER. 
SO IT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING 
TO SEE IF SHE IS REASSIGNED OR 
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED AT THE 
U.N. SO -- 
>> RIGHT. 
WELL, IT IS VERY INTERESTING 
THAT THEY ARE COMING TO MAKE 
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT TOGETHER IT 
SEEMS PRESENT AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE AS WELL AND THE WHITE 
HOUSE IS CONFIRMING THIS 
INFORMATION AND SAYING THEY'LL 
BE TALKING MORE ABOUT IT IN 
JUST ABOUT 10 MINUTES OR -- 10 
MINUTES OR SO. 
NIKKI HALEY WAS TALKED ABOUT AS 
A POTENTIAL SECRETARY OF STATE 
JUST GIVEN HER PERCH AT THE 
U.N. AND GIVEN THE EXPERIENCE 
THAT SHE HAS BEEN COLLECTING IN 
THAT POST. 
OF COURSE AFTER REX TILLERSON 
RESIGNED, THE PRESIDENT CHOSE 
MIKE POMPEO WHO WAS THE FORMER 
C.I.A. 
DIRECTOR TO FILL THAT SECRETARY 
OF STATE POST, AND HE AND THE 
PRESIDENT ENJOY A VERY GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP AND THEY'RE ON 
GOOD TERMS. 
SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO 
SEE WHETHER NIKKI HALEY MIGHT 
BE REASSIGNED, HOW THIS 
DECISION WAS REACHED, WHETHER 
IN FACT IT WAS MUTUAL. 
WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF 
QUESTIONS GOING INTO THIS. 
THIS IS BIG NEWS, THOUGH, 
HOWEVER, BECAUSE WHEN YOU TALK 
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT 
SUPPORTIVE OF THE PRESIDENT BUT 
ARE IN REPUBLICAN POLITICS, 
THEY OFTEN POINT TO NIKKI HALEY 
AS SOMETHING OF A BRIGHT LIGHT. 
THEY POINT TO NIKKI HALEY AND 
JAMES MATTIS, THE DEFENSE 
SECRETARY AS KIND OF THE PEOPLE 
IN THE ADMINISTRATION WHO ARE 
KIND OF KEEPING A LOT OF THINGS 
TOGETHER. 
AND SO SHE DOES ENJOY A LOT OF 
SUPPORT AND SOME BIPARTISAN 
SUPPORT, QUITE FRANKLY. 
AND, AGAIN, GIVEN THAT SHE'S 
BEEN HERE IN NEW YORK, GIVEN 
THAT SHE HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM 
THE CHAOS IN WASHINGTON AT THE 
U.N., SHE HAS ENJOYED SOME VERY 
POSITIVE RATINGS. 
>> HOW DO YOU THINK SHE WOULD 
DO -- I MEAN, PURE SPECULATION 
HERE, IF SHE WAS MOVED TO 
WASHINGTON D.C. AND WORKED MORE 
CLOSELY WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP? 
BECAUSE LOOKING AT THEIR 
HISTORY, IT'S BEEN UP AND DOWN. 
>> IT HAS BEEN UP AND DOWN. 
REMEMBER A COUPLE OF MOBILITIES 
AGO WHEN THAT ANONYMOUS OP-ED 
WAS PUBLISHED IN THE "NEW YORK 
TIMES" FROM A WHITE HOUSE OR 
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL 
CRITICIZING THE PRESIDENT, 
NIKKI HALEY RELEASED HER OWN 
EDITORIAL IN THE "WASHINGTON 
POST" SAYING, YOU KNOW, DENYING 
THAT IT WAS HER AND SAYING IF 
SHE DID HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE 
PRESIDENT, SHE EXPRESSES THEM 
TO HIM DIRECTLY AND TO THE 
ADMINISTRATION, AND SHE CALLED 
THAT OP-ED VERY DANGEROUS IN 
TERMS OF WHAT IT WAS DOING, 
THAT "NEW YORK TIMES" OP-ED. 
AND SO SHE HAS CARVED OUT HER 
OWN BRAND REALLY IN THIS 
ADMINISTRATION. 
NOW, SHE WAS GOVERNOR OF SOUTH 
CAROLINA, A POPULAR GOVERNOR, 
AND SHE MADE A LOT OF NEWS IN 
2016 FOR CALLING FOR THE 
CONFEDDER AT FLAG TO BE REMOVE 
-- CONFED RAT FLAG TO BE 
REMOVED FROM STATEHOUSE 
GROUNDS. 
THAT WAS A CULTURAL MOMENT IN 
THE COUNTRY. 
SHE RECEIVED A LOT OF SUPPORT 
FOR THAT DECISION AND IT WAS A 
RISKY DECISION JUST GIVEN THE 
HISTORY IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
AND SO SHE KIND OF ROSE -- HAS 
BEEN RISING ON THE NATIONAL 
STAGE, AND SO WE'LL SEE WHAT'S 
NEXT FOR HER. 
>> FIRST INDIAN AMERICAN TO 
HOLD OFFICE IN THE STATE OF 
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
SHE HAS DEFINITELY MADE HISTORY 
IN HER POLITICAL HISTORY. 
SOMETHING THAT'S INTERESTING 
IS, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE LOOK AT 
THE TIMING OF THIS, YESTERDAY 
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND DEPUTY 
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN 
AND HOW THERE WERE RUMORS 
CIRCULATING THAT HE WAS GOING 
TO BE FIRED, AND WE DISCUSSED 
IT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY 
HAVE BEEN ADVISING THE 
PRESIDENT, SAYING, HEY, WE'RE 
ONLY 28 DAYS AWAY FROM THE 
MIDTERMS, LET'S KEEP EVERYTHING 
SMOOTH SAILING AS WE GO 
FORWARD. 
SO THIS A LOT OF REPUBLICANS 
ARE SAYING THAT THEY'VE 
RECEIVED THIS ENERGY BOOST AND 
THE BASE HAS BEEN REIGNITED. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> SO SINCE YOU CALL HER, YOU 
KNOW, A SHINING STAR IN THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY AND SHE CAN 
CROSS BOTH PARTIES, WOULD THIS 
BE MAYBE A POLITICAL MOVE TO 
JUST KIND OF GET SOME MORE 
ENERGY IF SHE IS REASSIGNED? 
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S A GOOD 
QUESTION AND IT ALL REALLY 
DEPENDS ON WHAT HAPPENS NEXT 
FOR HER AND WHAT IS SURROUNDING 
THIS RESIGNATION AND WHAT THAT 
RELATIONSHIP IS IN FACT LIKE AS 
SHE DEPARTS FROM THE 
ADMINISTRATION AS SHE IS 
PLANNING TO DO REPORTEDLY. 
SO WHAT'S VERY INTERESTING TO 
CONSIDER IS THAT WITH ROD 
ROSENSTEIN, IF TRUMP WERE TO 
FIRE HIM, THERE WOULD BE A REAL 
NEGATIVE REACTION, NOT ONLY 
AMONG REPUBLICANS AND 
DEMOCRATS, BUT AMONG THE PUBLIC 
BECAUSE IT WOULD SIGNAL A MORE 
CHAOTIC -- SPEAK TO THE MORE 
CHAOTIC ELEMENTS OF THIS 
ADMINISTRATION GIVEN THAT 
ROSENSTEIN OVERSEES THE RUSSIA 
PROBE AND THAT WOULD INTRODUCE 
A WHOLE HOST OF ISSUES FOR THIS 
PRESIDENT BOTH LEGALLY AND IN 
TERMS OF POLITICS. 
SO WE'RE WAITING TO SEE WHAT 
EXACTLY NIKKI HALEY IS GOING TO 
DO AND WHAT EXACTLY ARE THE 
FACTS SURROUNDING THIS 
RESIGNATION I THINK COULD HELP 
INFORM US ABOUT WHAT KIND OF 
IMPACT THIS COULD HAVE IN THE 
FUTURE. 
>> WE DO KNOW THAT WE ARE 
GETTING CLOSER, WE ARE AWAITING 
A LIVE EVENT FROM THE OVAL 
OFFICE AT 10:30 EASTERN 
STANDARD TIME WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND U.N. AMBASSADOR NIKKI 
HALEY WHO HAS RESIGNED. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ACCEPTED HER 
RESIGNATION EARLIER TODAY. 
WE DO KNOW THAT THE PRESS POOL 
HAS BEEN MOVED INTO THE OVAL 
OFFICE AND THAT EVENT IS 
EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE AT 
10:30, AGAIN, U.N. AMBASSADOR 
NIKKI HALEY HAS RESIGNED, AND 
WE ARE COVERING THIS. 
WE'RE GOING TO BRING YOU THAT 
EVENT LIVE. 
WE'RE TALKING WITH OUR CBSN 
POLITICAL REPORTER CAITLIN HUEY 
BURNS WHO'S BEEN COVERING THIS 
ADMINISTRATION, AND, YOU KNOW, 
LOOKING AT NIKKI HALEY, WE KNOW 
THERE'S A LOT OF POSITIVE 
ATTRIBUTES  THAT WE HAVE TALKED 
ABOUT. 
HAS SHE BEEN UNDER THE 
MICROSCOPE FOR ANYTHING ELSE 
THAT HAS BEEN SWIRLING AROUND? 
>> WELL, SHE HAS BEEN UN -- 
UNLIKE THE PRESIDENT, SHE'S 
BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF RUSSIA. 
SHE'S ALSO BEEN VERY OUTSPOKEN 
WHEN SHE DOES DISAGREE WITH THE 
ADMINISTRATION ON THE WAY 
FORWARD WHEN IT COMES TO 
FOREIGN POLICY AND SHE'S 
REALLY, AGAIN, CARVED OUT AN 
IDENTITY FOR HERSELF KIND OF 
SEPARATE OF THE TRUMP WHITE 
HOUSE WHICH HAS BEEN KIND OF 
HOW SHE HAS BEEN ABLE TO 
SUCCEED REALLY AND KIND OF 
GARNER POSITIVE SUPPORT. 
THERE ARE QUESTIONS I WOULD 
IMAGINE ABOUT THAT RELATIONSHIP 
ABOUT THOSE DIFFERENCES AS IT 
RED LIGHTS -- RELATES TO THIS 
POST. 
REMEMBER, THE PRESIDENT WAS 
JUST HERE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO 
SPEAKING TO THE U.N. GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY, AND THAT'S REALLY 
NIKKI HALEY'S BREAD AND BUTTER 
OF COURSE GIVEN HER POST AT THE 
U.N. SO I AM WONDERING IF THERE 
HAD BEEN CONVERSATIONS THEN, IF 
THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT 
THEIR DIFFERENCES AS IT RELATES 
TO FOREIGN POLICY, ESPECIALLY 
AS THE PRESIDENT PREPARES TO 
CONTINUE THIS OPEN RELATIONSHIP 
AND DIALOGUE WITH NORTH KOREA. 
POMPEO OF COURSE JUST MEETING 
WITH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG-UN 
JUST THIS WEEK AND RETURNING 
FROM THAT TRIP. 
SO KEEPING AN EYE ON WHETHER 
THIS IS ABOUT THOSE 
DIFFERENCES, WHETHER THEY ARE 
NOT ABLE TO GET ON THE SAME 
PAGE OR WHETHER SHE IS BEING 
MOVED TO ANOTHER POSITION OR 
WHETHER THIS WAS A SPLIT THAT 
WAS MUTUALLY AGREED UPON. 
>> SO MANY QUESTIONS. 
FASCINATING TO WATCH AND WAIT, 
YOU KNOW, TO HEAR EXACTLY WHAT 
IS HAPPENING. 
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP TWEETED OUT BIG 
ANNOUNCEMENT WITH MY FRIEND, 
AND I THINK THAT'S INTERESTING 
WORDING THERE BECAUSE THERE'S 
ALWAYS SPECULATION THAT MAYBE 
SOMETHING WENT WRONG. 
BUT, AGAIN, BIG ANNOUNCEMENT 
WITH MY FRIEND AMBASSADOR NIKKI 
HALEY IN THE OVAL OFFICE AT 
10:30 A.M. 
WE'RE JUST ABOUT A MINUTE AND A 
HALF AWAY FROM THAT. 
WE DO KNOW THAT THE PRESS POOL 
HAS GATHERED IN THE OVAL OFFICE 
TO HEAR FROM BOTH OF THEM. 
THERE HAS BEEN SPECULATION THAT 
MAYBE NIKKI HALEY HAS BEEN 
REASSIGNED. 
SHE DECLINED TO COMMENT AS SHE 
WALKED INTO THE OVAL OFFICE. 
YOU KNOW, CAITLIN, WHAT DOES 
HISTORY SHOW US IN TERMS OF A 
U.S. AMBASSADOR POST, HOW LONG 
DO THEY TYPICALLY STAY? 
DO THEY STAY THE WHOLE TERM? 
>> WELL, IT IS AN INTERESTING 
POSITION BECAUSE, AGAIN, YOU'RE 
NOT IN WASHINGTON, YOU'RE HERE 
IN NEW YORK. 
SO THAT GIVES YOU SOME KIND OF 
AUTONOMY AND IT IS A CHANCE FOR 
SOMEONE LIKE NIKKI HALEY WHO 
WAS COMING AS A GOVERNOR WAS 
VERY A LONG-TIME POLITICAL 
FIGURE, NOW THIS POSITION HAS 
ALLOWED HER TO ACCUMULATE 
FOREIGN POLICY EXPERIENCE AND 
EXPERIENCE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE 
NOT OTHERWISE HAD AS GOVERNOR 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA. 
SO IT'S SEEN IN SOME WAYS AS 
PERHAPS A LAUNCHING PAD FOR 
HIGHER OFFICE WHICH IS LOTS OF 
FOLKS KIND OF SPECULATED AT THE 
BEGINNING THAT SHE HAD HER EYES 
ON BIGGER AMBITIONS BEYOND THE 
U.N. IT CAN BE REALLY A 
LAUNCHING PAD FOR HIGHER OFFICE 
IF SHE INDEED CHOSE TO DO SO. 
THERE WAS SPECULATION OF COURSE 
LAST YEAR WHEN THE PRESIDENT 
WAS FEUDING WITH REX TILLERSON 
PRIVATELY THAT NIKKI HALEY 
WOULD BE SOMEONE WHO WOULD 
ASSUME THAT ROLE AND THAT THAT 
MIGHT GIVE HER A BIGGER 
PLATFORM. 
HE OF COURSE CHOSE MIKE POMPEO, 
THE FORMER C.I.A. 
DIRECTOR WHO HAS A GREAT 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT 
AND THE PRESIDENT SPEAKS VERY 
HIGHLY OF HIM. 
YOU DO KNOW THAT LANGUAGE, 
THOUGH, THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
BEEN USING TO DESCRIBE NIKKI 
HALEY AS MY FRIEND, THE FACT 
THAT THIS IS KIND OF SEEMING TO 
BE A FORMAL ROLLOUT FIRST 
REPORTED BY AXIOS AND NOW 
CONFIRMED, THE WHITE HOUSE 
EXPECTED TO TALK IN A COUPLE OF 
MINUTES HERE AND EXPLAIN MORE 
ABOUT THE DECISION MAKING 
PROCESS. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
IT IS 10:30 EASTERN STANDARD 
TIME, AND WE ARE AWAITING AN 
ANNOUNCEMENT FROM PRESIDENT 
TRUMP FROM THE OVAL OFFICE WITH 
U.N. AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY WHO 
HAS RESIGNED, REALLY SENDING 
SHOCKWAVES THROUGHOUT THE 
POLITICAL WORLD THIS MORNING. 
IT DOESN'T SEEM AS IF THAT WAS 
EXPECTED AT ALL. 
CAITLIN, YOU MENTIONED THAT SHE 
JUST RECENTLY WROTE THAT 
REBUTTAL TO THE ANONYMOUS OP-
ED, AND I JUST WANT TO READ A 
LITTLE BIT OF THAT AS WE ARE 
WAITING FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT 
FROM THE OVAL OFFICE. 
AND NIKKI HALEY WROTE IN THERE 
THAT THE AUTHOR MIGHT THINK HE 
OR SHE IS DOING A SERVICE TO 
THE COUNTRY. 
I STRONGLY DISAGREE. 
WHAT THIS SENIOR OFFICIAL IN 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS 
DONE AND IS APPARENTLY INTENT 
ON CONTINUING TO DO IS A 
SERIOUS DISSERVICE NOT JUST TO 
THE PRESIDENT, BUT TO THE 
COUNTRY. 
SHE WENT OBJECT TO -- WENT ON 
TO WRITE I TOO AM A SENIOR 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL, 
I SERVE IN THIS ADMINISTRATION 
AND I ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT 
THE DECISIONS IN WHICH HE IS 
TAKING THE COUNTRY. 
READING THAT, THAT SEEMS LIKE 
WE WERE GOING TO BE THE LAST 
THING WE WOULD BE DISCUSSING 
TODAY. 
>> EXACTLY. 
WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING 
ABOUT WHEN THAT "NEW YORK 
TIMES" OP-ED CAME OUT, EVERYONE 
IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND EVERYONE 
OUTSIDE OF IT WAS PLAYING THE 
SPECULATION GAME, TRYING TO 
FIND WHO WAS THE WRITER OF THAT 
OP-ED. 
YOU HAD MANY ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THE VICE 
PRESIDENT HAVE TO COME OUT AND 
SAY THAT IT WASN'T THEM. 
AND SO NIKKI HALEY'S REBUTTAL, 
THAT PUBLISHED REBUTTAL WAS 
REALLY REMARKABLE AND MAKING 
CLEAR -- SHE WAS TRYING TO MAKE 
CLEAR THAT IT WASN'T HER AND 
SHE SAID THAT WHILE SHE DOES 
HAVE SERIOUS DISAGREEMENTS WITH 
THE PRESIDENT, SHE VOICES THEM 
TO HIM DIRECTLY, AND SHE CALLED 
THAT "NEW YORK TIMES" OP-ED 
SOMETHING OF A DANGEROUS 
ENDEAVOR TO GO DOWN THAT ROUTE. 
WHAT IS VERY INTERESTING, 
THOUGH, IS THAT A LOT OF 
REPUBLICANS HAVE HAD THEIR EYE 
ON NIKKI HALEY BEFORE DONALD 
TRUMP KIND OF CAME INTO FORE, 
SHE WAS CONSIDERED A POTENTIAL 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HERSELF. 
HER ENDORSEMENT IN THE 2016 
PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY ON THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE WAS AMONG THE 
MOST COVETED BECAUSE SHE DID 
KIND OF REPRESENT THAT NEW 
REPRESENT BRAND THAT MORE 
INCLUSIVE AND DIVERSE 
REPUBLICAN BRAND THAT THE PARTY 
WAS SELLING OF COURSE BEFORE 
2016 OR TRYING TO SELL. 
SHE ENDORSED MARCO RUBIO IN 
SOUTH CAROLINA, AND THAT WAS 
CONSIDERED SOMETHING OF A 
LAUNCHING POINT FOR HIM. 
BUT WE KNOW HOW THAT TURNED 
OUT. 
THE PARTY DECIDED TO GO THE 
OTHER WAY. 
HALEY HAD BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF 
DONALD TRUMP AND HIS RHETORIC 
THROUGHOUT THE 2016 CAMPAIGN. 
THEY MADE AMENDS AFTER HIS 
ELECTION AND OF COURSE SHE WAS 
APPOINTED TO THIS POST. 
AND THIS POST WAS SEEN AS A 
REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR HER NOT 
ONLY TO ACCRUE FOREIGN POLICY 
EXPERIENCE AND MORE EXPERIENCE 
ON KIND OF A NATIONAL STAGE AND 
ALSO PERHAPS GIVING HER A 
PLATFORM FOR A PRESIDENTIAL RUN 
DOWN THE ROAD OR SOME HIGHER 
OFFICE IN ADDITION TO HER 
EXPERIENCE AS TWO TERMS AS 
SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR. 
>> YOU BRING UP A FASCINATING 
POINT. 
HER AMBITION FOR HIGHER OFFICE. 
WE HAVE SEEN DIFFERENT HINTS AT 
THAT. 
HOW WOULD YOU SEE THAT PLAYING 
OUT AND WOULD YOU EXPECT HER TO 
CHALLENGE PRESIDENT TRUMP GOING 
FORWARD OR, YOU KNOW, HOW WOULD 
THAT PLAY OUT? 
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF NEVER 
TRUMPERS AS WE CALL THEM. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME 
KIND OF CHALLENGE. 
YOU KNOW, ON PAPER IT WOULD 
SEEM THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD 
BE RIPE FOR AN INTER-PARTY 
CHALLENGE GIVEN HIS 
UNPOPULARITY NATIONALLY. 
BUT HE IS VERY POPULAR AMONG 
REPUBLICANS AND STILL REMAINS 
SO. 
AND ANY CHALLENGE AMONG 
REPUBLICANS WOULD REALLY BE IN 
VAIN AT THIS POINT. 
AND SO IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER 
SHE WOULD WAGE THAT, ALTHOUGH 
LOTS OF FOLKS IN THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY WHO DO NOT LIKE TRUMP DO 
NOT LIKE HIS STYLE POINT TO HER 
AS A BRIGHT SPOT IN THE 
ADMINISTRATION AND THE FACT 
THAT SHE HAS STAYED FROM THE 
BEGINNING WHEN WE'VE SEEN SO 
MANY DEPARTURES IN THIS WHITE 
HOUSE, HER STAYING IN THAT 
POSITION WAS PRETTY MUCH AN 
ANOMALY, I MEAN, HER, JAMES 
MATTIS, OF COURSE THE SECRETARY 
OF DEFENSE IS STILL THERE AND A 
COUPLE OF OTHERS. 
BUT WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY 
DEPARTURES IN THIS WHITE HOUSE. 
NOW, WE ARE APPROACHING A 
MIDTERM AND THERE -- TYPICALLY 
IN ADMINISTRATIONS PEOPLE START 
TO RE-EVALUATE THEIR POSITIONS. 
IT REALLY DEPENDS. 
WE'LL SEE WHETHER THE PRESIDENT 
FACES SERIOUS POLITICAL 
CONSEQUENCES IN NOVEMBER FOR 
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HE HAS 
DONE AND SAID. 
WE ARE STILL KIND OF KEEPING AN 
EYE ON THAT. 
BUT THIS IS REALLY BIG NEWS 
COMING FROM WASHINGTON JUST 
GIVEN THAT WE HAVE BEEN 
WATCHING HER REALLY COME INTO 
THIS POSITION AND DEFINE 
HERSELF AND CARVE OUT HER OWN 
IDENTITY IN THIS POST. 
>> LET'S JUST BRING EVERYBODY ú 
WE ARE FOLLOWING BREAKING NEWS 
OUT OF WASHINGTON D.C. U.N. 
AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY HAS 
RESIGNED. 
WE ARE WAITING FOR AN EVENT, A 
LIVE EVENT OUT OF THE OVAL 
OFFICE ANY MINUTE NOW. 
WE ARE EXPECTING TO HEAR FROM 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND NIKKI HALEY 
FROM THE OVAL OFFICE. 
IT WAS SCHEDULED AT 10:30. 
IT IS NOW 10:35 EASTERN 
STANDARD TIME. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETING OUT 
JUST A SHORT TIME AGO BIG 
ANNOUNCEMENT WITH MY FRIEND 
U.N. AMBASADOR NIKKI HALEY AT 
10:30 OUT OF THE OVAL OFFICE. 
AGAIN, AS CAITLIN HUEY BURNS IS 
REPORTING RIGHT NOW, THIS IS 
BIG NEWS COMING OUT OF 
WASHINGTON, A LOT OF UNANSWERED 
QUESTIONS, HAS SHE BEEN 
REASSIGNED, WAS SHE ASKED TO 
RESIGN, DID THIS TAKE THE 
PRESIDENT OFF GUARD, WHEN DID 
SHE MAKE THIS DECISION, SO MANY 
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. 
WE DO KNOW THAT THE PRESS POOL 
IS WAITING IN THE OVAL OFFICE 
READY TO ANSWER SO MANY OF 
THOSE QUESTIONS. 
CAITLIN, JUST LOOKING AT 
POSSIBLE REPLACEMENTS, YOU 
KNOW, WHO WOULD COME UP IN YOUR 
MIND? 
>> IT'S A GOOD QUESTION, 
ESPECIALLY HOW CRITICAL THIS 
ROLE HAS BEEN. 
REMEMBER JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO 
THE PRESIDENT WAS IN NEW YORK 
FOR THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL 
ASSEMBLY, AND NIKKI HALEY HAS 
BEEN KIND OF AT THE FOREFRONT 
OF THAT OF COURSE GIVEN THIS 
ROLE. 
SO THERE IS A BIG QUESTION 
ABOUT WHO WOULD FILL THAT 
POSITION, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE 
ITEMS AT HAND, NORTH KOREA OF 
COURSE BEING FRONT AND CENTER 
AT THIS POINT. 
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE TOO 
IS, YOU KNOW, WHETHER SHE IS IN 
FACT REASSIGNED OR WHETHER SHE 
IS LEAVING, WHETHER SHE BECOMES 
ACTIVE ON THE MIDTERM CAMPAIGN 
TRAIL GIVEN THAT SHE IS -- YOU 
KNOW, IF SHE'S NOT REASSIGNED 
THAT SHE COULD BE FREE TO DO 
THAT. 
OF COURSE SHE IS REALLY BELOVED 
BY REPUBLICAN, SHE AND LINDSAY 
GRAHAM SENATOR FROM SOUTH 
CAROLINA ARE REALLY CLOSE BEING 
THAT THEY SHARE A HOME STATE 
AND HAVE WORKED CLOSELY 
TOGETHER, OF COURSE GRAHAM 
BEING A KEY ALLY OF THE 
PRESIDENT HAS EMERGED AS HIS 
TOP ALLY IN THE SENATE AT THIS 
POINT. 
SO I'M VERY INTERESTED TO SEE 
THE WAY IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT 
VIEWS THIS AND HOW THEY CAME TO 
THIS DECISION. 
>> WELL, AS WE WAIT FOR THIS 
ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE OVAL 
OFFICE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
NIKKI HALEY, WE WANT TO BRING 
IN OUR CBS NEWS STATE 
DEPARTMENT REPORTER KYLIE 
ATWOOD WHO IS JOINING US NOW 
WITH THIS NEWS. 
KYLIE, YOUR REACTION, WHAT ARE 
YOU HEARING? 
>>REPORTER:  WELL, I'VE BEEN 
MAKING CALLS FOR THE PAST 15 
MINUTES SINCE THIS NEWS BROKE. 
AND SHOCKINGLY NONE OF HALEY'S 
AIDES ARE ANSWERING THE PHONE. 
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I 
THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO 
NOTE IS THAT THOUGH NIKKI HALEY 
CAME IN AND HAS BEEN A 
CONSISTENT SUPPORTER OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP THROUGHOUT, A 
LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT I'M 
CALLING TODAY ARE FOLKS THAT 
HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH NIKKI 
HALEY SINCE SHE WAS THE 
GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA. 
HER TOP POLICY PERSON WHO'S 
BASED HERE IN WASHINGTON D.C. 
WAS A POLLSTER WITH HER WORKING 
IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
A LOT OF HER TOP AIDES WHO HAVE 
BEEN WORKING WITH HER AT THE 
UNITED NATIONS IN NEW YORK CAME 
WITH HER FROM SOUTH CAROLINA AS 
WELL. 
SO EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS A BIG 
PART OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, 
SHE DEFINITELY HAD HER OWN 
LITTLE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT 
WERE VERY CLOSE TO HER, AND IT 
WAS HARD TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS 
HAPPENING WITHIN THE SMALLNESS 
OF THAT GROUP. 
>> AND WE ALSO ARE -- WE JUST 
WANT TO REMIND OUR VIEWERS THAT 
WE ARE AWAITING THIS 
ANNOUNCEMENT OUT OF THE OVAL 
OFFICE AT 10:30. 
WE'RE A LITTLE PAST THIS RIGHT 
NOW. 
KYLIE ATWOOD IS FOLLOWING THIS 
STORY FOR US OUT OF STATE 
DEPARTMENT AND CAITLIN HUEY 
BURNS IS HERE ON SET WITH ME, A 
CBSN POLITICAL REPORTER. 
WE'RE ALSO JUST LOOKING UP 
NIKKI HALEY WAS ON "FACE THE 
NATION" ON SEPTEMBER 23rd, AND 
JUST KIND OF LOOKING OVER HER 
TRANSCRIPT HERE, CAITLIN, RIGHT 
NOW, I'M JUST LOOKING TO SEE IF 
THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT MIGHT 
HAVE HINTED AT THIS. 
YOU KNOW, SHE DISCUSSED WITH 
JOHN DICKERSON DIFFERENT 
TOPICS. 
AND AS I GO THROUGH THIS AND 
JUST LOOK AT THIS TRANSCRIPT, 
JUST GO OVER THE RELATIONSHIP 
AND THE HISTORY WITH PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, IT'S BEEN ON AGAIN, OFF 
AGAIN AND HOW THEY'VE COME 
TOGETHER? 
>> YES, IT HAS BEEN AN ON-AGAIN-
OFF-AGAIN RELATIONSHIP. 
IN 2016 SHE WAS A KEY CRITIC OF 
HIM. 
SHE WAS AN ALLY OF JEB BUSH 
GIVEN THAT THEY BOTH SERVED AS 
GOVERNOR. 
SHE SPOKE WITH HIM. 
SHE ENDED UP ENDORSING MARCO 
RUBIO, THE FLORIDA SENATOR IN 
THAT REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, THAT 
VERY CROWDED REPUBLICAN 
PRIMARY. 
AND WHEN SHE GAVE THAT 
ENDORSEMENT, IT WAS SEEN AS A 
BIG BOOST IN SOUTH CAROLINA TO 
RUBIO. 
OF COURSE TRUMP ENDED UP TAKING 
THAT STATE. 
BUT WHAT WAS VERY INTERESTING 
ABOUT HALEY WAS THAT SHE WASN'T 
-- AT THE TIME WASN'T AFRAID TO 
BE CRITICAL OF THEN CANDIDATE 
TRUMP. 
SHE CRITICIZED HIS RHETORIC, 
SHE GAVE A RESPONSE, SHE WAS 
TAPPED BY REPUBLICANS TO GIVE A 
RESPONSE TO THEN PRESIDENT 
OBAMA'S FINAL STATE OF THE 
UNION IN 2016 AND SHE REALLY 
EVOKED HER IMMIGRANT HISTORY, 
HER PARENTS OF COURSE. 
SHE REALLY WAS CRITICAL WITHOUT 
NAMING TRUMP OF THE RHETORIC 
THAT HE WAS ESPOUSING AND SHE 
TRIED TO STRIKE A MORE 
CONTILLTORY TONE AND A MORE 
INCLUSIVE TONE IN THAT SPEECH. 
AND THAT WAS SOMETHING -- IN 
THAT REBUTTAL, AND THAT WAS 
SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF FOLKS 
HAD THEIR EYE ON AT THE TIME. 
OF COURSE TRUMP WON THE 
NOMINATION, WON THE ELECTION 
AND HALEY JOINED HIS 
ADMINISTRATION. 
SHE HAS SINCE SAID AND KYLIE 
CAN SPEAK TO THIS MORE 
DIRECTLY, SHE HAS SAID IN THAT 
"WASHINGTON POST" OP-ED THAT 
SHE IS -- OPPOSES THE PRESIDENT 
OR VOICES HER CONCERNS WHEN SHE 
NEEDS TO AND JOINS HIM WHEN SHE 
FEELS THAT IS CORRECT. 
SHE HAS BEEN INOCULATED IN SOME 
RESPECTS FROM THE DRAMA GOING 
ON IN WASHINGTON GIVEN HER 
PERCH HERE IN NEW YORK, AND 
THAT HAS HELPED I THINK -- HAS 
HELPED HER IN THIS POSITION, 
BUT ALSO SHE IS STILL VERY 
POPULAR AMONG THE GENERAL 
PUBLIC WHEN MANY FOLKS 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
ADMINISTRATION ARE NOT. 
>> KYLIE, WEIGH IN ON THAT AS 
WELL. 
>>REPORTER:  YEAH. 
I MEAN, HALEY THROUGH AND 
THROUGH HAS BEEN THE ONE WHO 
SAID WHEN SHE HAS PROBLEMS WITH 
THE PRESIDENT, SHE TAKES HIM ON 
DIRECTLY. 
SO SHE HAS BEEN AN ADVOCATE FOR 
A LOT OF HIS POLICIES, AND WHEN 
SHE DOESN'T AGREE, SHE MARCHS 
INTO THE WHITE HOUSE TO THE 
OVAL OFFICE TO TELL HIM THAT. 
A FEW THINGS THAT SHE HAS BEEN 
AN ADVOCATE FOR WITH THIS 
ADMINISTRATION, NUMBER ONE WAS 
MOVING THE EMBASSY FROM TEL 
AVIV TO JERUSALEM IN ISRAEL. 
SHE WAS A BIG PROPONENT OF 
THAT. 
AND SINCE THAT HAS HAPPENED, 
SHE HAS BEEN THE ONE TO FACE 
THE BLOWBACK ON THE WORLD STAGE 
AT THE U.N. BECAUSE MOST 
COUNTRIES DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE 
U.S. IN THAT DECISION. 
AND SHE HAS ALSO BEEN THE ONE 
TO TAKE THAT A BIT PERSONALLY. 
MUCH LIKE THE PRESIDENT, SOME 
OF THE CRITICISM THAT SHE 
RECEIVES GOES DEEP WITH HER. 
AND SO AS WE HAVE SEEN THIS 
ADMINISTRATION PULL BACK ITS 
AIDE FROM U.N.R.A. 
WHICH IS A U.N. ORGANIZATION 
THAT PROVIDES SUPPORT TO 
PALESTINIAN REFUGEES, THAT'S 
SOMETHING THAT NIKKI HALEY WAS 
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF BECAUSE THE 
PALESTINIANS TREATED THE U.S. 
WITH SUCH FRUSTRATION, WITH 
SUCH ANGER AFTER THEY MOVED THE 
ISRAEL EMBASSY. 
>> AND SO THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT 
OF THESE ISSUES WHERE, YOU 
KNOW, HALEY HAS BEEN THE 
LEADING VOICE AND SHE'S NOT 
AFRAID TO GET OUT THERE AND BE 
VOCAL ABOUT IT. 
SHE ACTUALLY WAS THE ONE AT ONE 
POINT WHO PRESCRIBED -- SAID 
THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
WAS GOING TO BE PUTTING NEW 
SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA, AND THEN 
THEY DIDN'T DO IT. 
AND SHE SAID I WASN'T WRONG. 
THIS WAS A POINT OF CONFLICT IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE, THERE WAS SOME 
CONFUSION THERE. 
BUT I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT I WAS 
DOING. 
THIS IS NOT SOMEONE WHO HAS 
EVER STEPPED BACK FROM WHAT SHE 
BELIEVES IS RIGHT AND FROM THE 
POLICIES THAT SHE'S ADVOCATING 
FOR. 
I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT 
SHE HAD A VERY FROSTY 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FIRST 
SECRETARY OF STATE REX 
TILLERSON. 
THEY DID NOT GET ALONG. 
SHE WOULD COME TO WASHINGTON, 
SHE WOULDN'T EVEN TELL REX 
TILLERSON'S STAFF THAT SHE WAS 
HERE. 
IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THEY HAD 
THIS COMPETITION FOR POWER, WHO 
WAS THE ONE WHO WAS THE LEADING 
VOICE FOR FOREIGN POLICY FOR 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. 
AND SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD A 
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUMP. 
TILLERSON DIDN'T SEE A NEED TO 
REALLY DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP 
WITH NIKKI HALEY. 
>> KYLIE, LET ME JUST INTERRUPT 
YOU JUST FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE 
WE'RE JUST GETTING -- WE'RE 
STARTING TO GET SOME REPORTS 
FROM A POOL REPORTER IN THE 
OVAL OFFICE, AND WE'RE TOLD 
THAT MR. TRUMP SAID NIKKI HALEY 
HAS BEEN VERY SPECIAL TO ME, 
SHE'S DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB, 
FANTASTIC PERSON. 
SHE GETS IT. 
SHE'S BEEN AT THE U.N. SINCE 
THE BEGINNING. 
SHE TOLD ME SIX MONTHS AGO 
MAYBE AT THE END OF THE YEAR 
SHE WANTS TO TAKE A BREAK, WAS 
GOVERNOR, THIS PERHAPS EVEN 
MORE INTENSE, I'M READING OFF 
SOME ROUGH NOTES HERE, HE ALSO 
MENTIONED THAT NORTH KOREA IS 
MOVING ALONG WELL, POMPEO 
THINKS THE WORLD OF HER, ALL 
HAPPY FOR YOU BUT HATE TO LOSE 
YOU. 
AT THE END OF THE YEAR SHE WILL 
BE LEAVING, WE'LL BE IN 
CONSTANT TOUCH. 
SO WE'RE GETTING SOME NEW 
DETAILS ABOUT U.N. AMBASSADOR 
NIKKI HALEY'S RESIGNATION. 
WE DO KNOW THAT SHE WILL BE 
LEAVING AT THE END OF THE YEAR. 
WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT'S NEXT FOR 
HER. 
HAS SHE BEEN REASSIGNED? 
AND WHO HER POSSIBLE 
REPLACEMENT WOULD BE. 
KYLIE, I DIDN'T MEAN TO CUT YOU 
OFF, BUT GO AHEAD ONTO YOUR 
THOUGHT. 
>> NO. 
THOSE COMMENTS ARE PRETTY 
NONDESCRIPT, RIGHT? 
>> RIGHT. 
>> THEY SAY SHE'S LEAVING, 
THEY'RE NOT SAYING WHY, THEY'RE 
NOT POINTING TO ANY BAD BLOOD 
BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND 
NIKKI HALEY. 
THEY'RE SAYING SHE HAS A GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP WITH POMPEO. 
AS I WAS SAYING, HER 
RELATIONSHIP WITH REX 
TILLERSON, THE PREVIOUS 
SECRETARY OF STATE WASN'T THAT 
GREAT. 
SO SHE'S WALKING OUT THE DOOR 
IN GOOD STANDING WITH THIS 
PRESIDENT IT SEEMS. 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET DOWN 
TO THE BOTTOM OF OF WHY SHE'S 
CHOOSING TO WALK OUT THE DOOR. 
>> EXACTLY. 
AND JUST TO FILL EVERYBODY IN, 
IF YOU'RE JUST JOINING US, U.N. 
AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY HAS 
RESIGNED HER POST. 
WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR AN 
ANNOUNCEMENT FROM PRESIDENT 
TRUMP OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. 
IT WAS SCHEDULED AT 10:30 WHEN 
HE TWEETED OUT BIG ANNOUNCEMENT 
WITH MY FRIEND NIKKI HALEY OUT 
OF THE OVAL OFFICE AT 10:30. 
WE DO KNOW THAT SHE IS GOING TO 
BE LEAVING AT THE END OF THE 
YEAR. 
CAITLIN HUEY BURNS IS ALSO 
HERE, CBSN POLITICAL REPORTER 
BREAKING DOWN AND TRYING TO 
ANALYZE EXACTLY WHAT'S TAKING 
PLACE IN WASHINGTON JUST 28 
DAYS FROM THE MIDTERMS. 
>> THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTAN 
POINT HERE. 
WE'RE JUST A MONTH AWAY FROM 
THE MIDTERM, AND YOU WOULD 
IMAGINE THAT THIS KIND OF 
SHAKEUP WOULD BE STARTLING TO 
SOME. 
NOW, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO 
CONSIDER THAT HALEY, AGAIN, IS 
NOT INVOLVED IN THE DAY-TO-DAY 
POLITICS GOING ON IN THE 
ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE SHE'S 
HERE IN NEW YORK FOCUSED ON 
FOREIGN POLICY AT HER PERCH IN 
THE U.N., AND SHE HAS BEEN 
REALLY ABLE TO CARVE OUT AN 
IDENTITY FOR HERSELF AND MANY 
HAVE SEEN THIS POSITION FOR HER 
AS A LAUNCHING PAD FOR 
SOMETHING ELSE EVENTUALLY, 
WETHER THAT BE A PRESIDENTIAL 
RUN OF HER OWN, OR SOMETHING 
ELSE. 
OF COURSE SHE IS VERY POPULAR 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT ALSO 
REALLY POPULAR AMONG 
REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE SEEN HER 
AS KIND OF A RISING STAR IN THE 
PARTY, SOMEONE THAT THE SO-
CALLED NEVER TRUMPERS OR THOSE 
WHO DON'T LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP 
POINT TO HER AS KIND OF A 
BRIGHT LIGHT IN THIS 
ADMINISTRATION. 
AND I THINK SO THAT YOU'LL HEAR 
FROM MANY OF THEM DISAPPOINT 
THAT SHE IS LEAVING -- 
DISAPPOINTMENT THAT SHE IS 
LEAVING, IF IN FACT SHE IS NOT 
REASSIGNED OR GOING SOMEWHERE 
ELSE. 
I ALSO WONDER IF SHE ISN'T 
GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE 
ADMINISTRATION AND IF SHE IS 
LEAVING THIS POST WHETHER IN 
FACT SHE WILL BECOME MORE 
POLITICALLY ACTIVE, WHETHER SHE 
WILL BE MORE ENGAGED IN 
POLITICS. 
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF 
NEVER TRUMPERS WHO MIGHT LIKE 
TO SEE HER CHALLENGE THE 
PRESIDENT. 
I THINK THAT IS A LONGER SHOT 
AT THIS POINT GIVEN THAT HE 
REMAINS SO POPULAR AMONG 
REPUBLICANS AT THIS POINT. 
AND YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF 
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES THIS 
CYCLE ENDEAR HIM IN PLACES THAT 
HE IS POPULAR. 
>> KYLIE, I'M JUST SPECULATING 
HERE. 
IN TERMS OF POSSIBLE POLITICAL 
ASPIRATIONS FOR NIKKI HALEY, 
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD SPECULATION 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP MIGHT 
CONSIDER HER AS A VICE 
PRESIDENT, A VICE PRESIDENTIAL 
CANDIDATE GOING FORWARD? 
AS WE ALL KNOW, WOMEN ON THE 
DEMOCRATIC SIDE, THEY'RE 
GEARING UP FOR QUITE A FIGHT IN 
THE NEXT ELECTION. 
>> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. 
I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT 
THE VICE PRESIDENT SPOT AS A 
TICKET FOR NIKKI HALEY, THOUGH, 
BECAUSE I THINK WHAT SHE'S DONE 
IN THIS ADMINISTRATION AND WHAT 
A LOT OF TOP ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIALS HAVE TRIED TO DO IS 
BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE PRESIDENT 
BUT ALSO CARVE OUT THEIR OWN 
NICHE AND TRY AND BE -- 
>> KYLIE, LET ME INTERRUPT YOU 
BECAUSE THIS IS BIG. 
HALEY JUST TOLD REPORTERS IN 
THE OVAL OFFICE SHE WILL BE 
CAMPAIGNING FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP 
IN 2020. 
SO OBVIOUSLY NO HINTS AT BAD 
BLOOD THERE. 
>> NO HINT OF BAD BLOOD THERE. 
THAT STILL DOESN'T CLOSE THE 
POSSIBILITY OF HER PERSONAL 
POLITICAL FUTURE BEING ONE THAT 
COULD BE DISTINCT TO THAT OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S. 
WHEN HIS ADMINISTRATION IS OVER 
AT THE WHITE HOUSE, WHETHER IT 
BE IN 2020 OR 2024, SHE IS A 
PERSON WHO HAS EXTENSIVE 
POLITICAL AMBITIONS AND HER 
TEAM HAS NEVER BEEN NECESSARILY 
DISCREET ABOUT THAT. 
THEY KNOW THAT SHE IS A VERY 
FORCEFUL, COMPASSIONATE WOMAN 
WITH A REALLY GREAT AMERICAN 
STORY. 
SHE HERSELF IS AN IMMIGRANT. 
SHE HAS INDIAN PARENTS, SHE 
TALKS ABOUT THAT. 
AND SO I THINK THAT TO SAY THAT 
HER POLITICAL FUTURE IS TIED TO 
TRUMP'S JUST BECAUSE SHE'S 
CAMPAIGNING FOR HIM ISN'T 
NECESSARILY TRUE. 
BUT IT DOES SHOW THAT SHE'S 
STILL SUPPORTIVE OF THIS 
PRESIDENT. 
>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT 
ANNOUNCEMENT, CAITLIN, THAT SHE 
WILL BE CAMPAIGNING FOR HIM IN 
2020? 
>> WELL, I THINK CERTAINLY, 
JUST TO PICK UP ON THAT POINT, 
IT'S NOT LIKE ANYBODY REALLY 
WANTS TO ROCK THE BOAT FOR THE 
PARTY AT THIS POINT EITHER. 
SO IT MAKES A LOT OF POLITICAL 
SENSE TO SAY THAT SHE IS 
REMAINING SUPPORTIVE OF THE 
PRESIDENT. 
THERE COULD BE A LOT OF 
DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT GO INTO 
THIS. 
BUT ANOTHER THING TO KEEP IN 
MIND ABOUT HALEY IN ADDITION TO 
WHAT KYLIE WAS SAYING IN TERMS 
OF HOW SHE HAS BEEN REALLY 
ADMIRED BY MANY REPUBLICANS 
JUST GIVEN HER BACKGROUND, IN 
2016 SHE TOOK WHAT WAS SEEN AS 
A BIG POLITICAL RISK IN CALLING 
FOR THE CONFEDERATE FLAG TO BE 
REMOVED FROM STATEHOUSE GROUNDS 
IN SOUTH CAROLINA WHILE SHE WAS 
GOVERNOR. 
THAT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A 
NATIONAL DEBATE OVER THAT, AND 
OF COURSE THIS WAS SHORTLY 
AFTER THAT HORRIFIC AND TRAGIC 
SHOOTING OF INNOCENT AFRICAN-
AMERICAN PARISHIONERS BY A 
WHITE MAN IN THAT CHURCH IN 
CHARLESTON. 
AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT 
REALLY ROCKED THE COUNTRY. 
AND SHE CALLED FOR THE REMOVAL 
OF THE CONFEDERATE FLAG FROM 
THE STATEHOUSE GROUNDS SHORTLY 
AFTER THAT IN 2016, AND A LOT 
OF PEOPLE IN THE REPUBLICAN 
PARTY AND QUITE FRANKLY OUTSIDE 
OF IT LOOKED TO HER AS A MODEL 
FOR ADDRESSING THIS IN THAT 
REALLY TOUGH POLITICAL TIME. 
AND SO SHE HAS REALLY RISEN TO 
PROMINENCE OVER THE PAST 
SEVERAL YEARS GIVEN HER 
BACKGROUND, GIVEN HER ABILITY 
TO REALLY KIND OF ENGAGE THE 
MOMENT. 
AND SO SHE HAS BEEN CONSIDERED 
SOMEONE WHO DOES HAVE AMBITIONS 
BEYOND THIS AND WE'LL SEE HOW 
THAT SHAKES OUT. 
THIS IS A POSITION THAT WOULD 
KIND OF ALLOW A LAUNCHING PAD 
FOR HIGHER OFFICE. 
>> KYLIE, WEIGH IN ON THAT A 
LITTLE BIT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, 
LOOKING BACK AT FORMER TWEETS 
FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP, TODAY, 
YOU KNOW, HE'S TWEETING OUT, 
YOU KNOW, A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT 
WITH MY FRIEND. 
A WHILE AGO, IT WASN'T TOO MANY 
YEARS AGO WHEN HE TWEETED OUT 
THAT THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH 
CAROLINA ARE EMBARRASSED BY 
HER. 
SO DEFINITELY A TUMULTUOUS PAST 
BETWEEN THE TWO. 
TALKING ABOUT TAKING RISKS, HOW 
BIG OF A RISK WAS IT TO BE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S U.N. 
AMBASSADOR IF SHE WANTS TO GO 
ON FOR HIGHER OFFICE HERSELF? 
>> I THINK THAT'S A GREAT 
POINT. 
I MEAN, IT WAS A BIG RISK, AND 
I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY 
THAT SHE'S PLAYED IT PRETTY 
WELL. 
SHE'S BEEN FORCEFUL WHERE SHE 
NEEDS TO BE. 
I WANT TO POINT OUT, THOUGH, 
THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE HAS BEEN 
PART OF EVERY SINGLE POLICY 
DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF FOREIGN 
POLICY AND THIS WHITE HOUSE. 
NORTH KOREA, THAT'S A BATON 
THAT IS HELD BY SECRETARY OF 
STATE MIKE POMPEO. 
ANOTHER DECISION THAT WAS 
RECENTLY MADE THAT WE PUT A LOT 
OF FOCUS ON WAS THE NEW REFUGEE 
NUMBERS COMING OUT OF THIS 
ADMINISTRATION. 
THEY CUT THE REFUGEE NUMBERS 
THAT ARE TO BE LET IN NEXT YEAR 
TO 30,000. 
THAT'S THE LOWEST NUMBER THAT 
WE HAVE SEEN IN MORE THAN 30 
YEARS. 
AND HALEY WAS NOT IN THE LAST 
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT NUMBER. 
SO THERE WERE SOME FRUSTRATIONS 
ON BEHALF OF HER TEAM IN TERMS 
OF NOT GIVING THE LAST FINAL 
SAY, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SHE 
COMES FROM REFUGEE PARENTS. 
SO THERE HAVE BEEN MOMENTS 
WHERE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN LOCK 
STEP. 
BUT, YOU KNOW, AS CAITLIN SAID, 
I MEAN, HALEY IS SOMEONE WITH 
POLITICAL AMBITIONS. 
AND SO SHE KNOWS WHERE TO PICK 
HER BATTLES AND WHERE NOT TO. 
SHE KNOWS, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE 
SAW THE ANONYMOUS OP-ED FROM A 
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL 
COME OUT A FEW WEEKS AGO, SHE 
WROTE A COUNTER OP-ED TO THAT, 
BASICALLY SAYING THAT SHE IS IN 
LINE WITH THE PRESIDENT, AND 
WHEN SHE DISAGREES WITH HIM, 
SHE DOES SO DIRECTLY. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
WE WANT TO BRING IN ON THE 
PHONE LESLIE SANCHEZ, OUR 
REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST. 
AND, LESLIE, THERE'S A LOT OF 
SPECULATION GOING ON RIGHT NOW. 
THERE'S SOME SPECULATION THAT 
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, PETE 
SESSIONS, IF HE LEFT OFFICE, 
SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR LINDSAY 
GRAHAM COULD BE CONSIDERED FOR 
THAT POSITION, OPENING UP 
ANOTHER SEAT IN SOUTH CAROLINA, 
A SENATE SEAT WHICH COULD GO TO 
NIKKI HALEY. 
SO TALK US THROUGH THAT WHOLE 
SCENARIO. 
>> SURE. 
THERE'S A LOT OF BUZZ INSOUTH 
CAROLINA RIGHT NOW OF THAT 
EXACT VIABILITY AND 
POSSIBILITY. 
AND MANY PEOPLE SPECULATE THAT 
THIS IS KIND OF MOVING -- 
SETTING UP THE SHUFFLING OF THE 
CARDS AND THESE CABINET 
POSITIONS POST-ELECTION DAY. 
SO IT'S OPENING -- CREATING 
OPPORTUNITIES AND OPENINGSES 
THAT DO NOT HAVE TO BE -- 
OPENINGS THAT DO NOT HAVE TO BE 
FILLED UNTIL AFTER THE 
ELECTION, BECAUSE IT WAS ALWAYS 
HIS IDEA TO NOT DO SOMETHING 
DRAMATIC WITH SESSIONS UNTIL 
THE MIDTERMS WERE OVER. 
SO IF SOMETHING LIKE THAT WERE 
TO HAPPEN AND LINDSAY GRAHAM 
WERE TO MOVE INTO A POSITION AT 
JUSTICE WHICH HE HAS OFTEN SAID 
HE DID NOT WANT TO DO, HE WAS 
VERY HAPPY -- LET'S REITERATE, 
HE WAS VERY HAPPY -- HE WAITED 
A VERY LONG TIME TO BE FOR 
SENATE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 
WHAT IT DOES IS CREATE SOME 
EXCITING POSSIBILITIES FOR THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND 
ESPECIALLY IN UNIFYING THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY. 
NIKKI HALEY IS SOMEBODY WHO'S 
EXTREMELY POPULAR. 
SHE HAS AN INDEPENDENT STANCE. 
WHEN SHE WENT INTO THE U.N., 
SHE HAD SOME GUIDELINES AND 
STIPULATIONS, SHE WANTED TO BE 
A POLICY PERSON. 
SHE SAID SOMEBODY OTHER THAN 
SHE SAID A WALLFLOWER. 
SHE WANTED TO BE PART OF THE 
DECISION MAKING PROCESS. 
AND I THINK SHE CAN WALK AWAY 
FEELING SHE DID THAT. 
IF SHE CAME AND SHE WAS TO FILL 
AN OPEN SEAT IN THE SENATE, 
MANY BELIEVE IT WOULD OPEN THE 
DOOR FOR HER TO BE A V.P. 
OR A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN 
THE FUTURE. 
AND SO, AGAIN, IT'S ABOUT 
LINING UP FOR TWO, FOUR, SIX 
YEARS FROM NOW. 
>> STAY THERE, LESLIE. 
WE'LL CHAT WITH YOU A LITTLE 
BIT MORE IN JUST A SECOND. 
I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME 
MORE COLOR, SOME COMMENTS THAT 
ARE COMING OUT OF THE OVAL 
OFFICE FROM NIKKI HALEY AS SHE 
APPARENTLY SAID THAT HER TWO 
YEARS AS THE UNITED NATIONS 
AMBASSADOR HAS BEEN AN HONOR OF 
A LIFETIME. 
SHE SAID WE WILL PUT OUR 
EMBASSY WHERE WE WANT TO PUT 
OUR EMBASSY. 
THE U.S. IS STRONG AGAIN IN A 
WAY PEOPLE SHOULD BE PROUD OF. 
SHE WENT ON TO SAY SHE CAN'T 
SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT 
JARED AND IVANKA, THANK YOU TO 
MY FAMILY. 
AND SHE ALSO SAID NOTHING IS 
SET ON WHERE I'M GOING TO GO. 
WAS GOVERNOR FOR SIX YEARS, 
EIGHT YEARS OF INTENSE TIME. 
I BELIEVE IN TERM LIMITS. 
SHE SAID SHE'S NOT RUNNING FOR 
PRESIDENT IN 2020. 
SHE WILL SUPPORT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. 
SHE BELIEVES GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS NEED TO MOVE ON. 
WE ALSO ARE GETTING WORD THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO SAID WHEN 
WE CAME INTO OFFICE ALMOST 
INEVITABLE IN THE EYES OF THE 
WORLD THAT WE WOULD BE GOING TO 
WAR WITH NORTH KOREA, ALLUDING 
TO THE FACT THAT U.N. 
AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY REALLY 
HELPED PLAY A ROLE THERE. 
HE ALSO THANKED HALEY AND SAID 
THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE WAY OF 
DOING IT. 
IN TERMS OF A SUCCESSOR, HE 
SAID THERE ARE A NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO DO 
THIS. 
IT IS A MUCH MORE GLAMOROUS 
POSITION THAN IT WAS A COUPLE 
OF YEARS AGO. 
KYLIE, HOW MUCH OF A ROLE DID 
NIKKI HALEY PLAY IN ELEVATING 
THE ROLE OF U.N. AMBASSADOR? 
>>REPORTER:  YOU KNOW, SHE 
WOULD SAY SHE PLAYED A HUGE 
ROLE IN THAT. 
I THINK THERE WOULD BE SOME WHO 
MAY CONTEST BECAUSE THERE HAVE 
BEEN PAST AMBASSADORS TO THE 
U.N. WHO HAVE OBVIOUSLY HAD A 
REALLY PUBLIC ROLE AS WELL, 
SAMANTHA POWER BEING ONE OF 
THOSE. 
BUT WHAT'S A LITTLE BIT 
DIFFERENT ABOUT NIKKI HALEY AND 
FORMER AMBASSADORS TO THE U.N. 
FOR MANY ADMINISTRATIONS IS 
THAT NIKKI HALEY IS VERY 
POLITICAL, AND THAT'S NOT 
ALWAYS THE CASE FOR THIS ROLE. 
IT'S SOMEONE WHO HAS TO WORK 
WITH WORLD LEADERS, IT'S 
SOMEONE WHO HAS TO KIND OF SEE 
WHERE THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER, 
WHERE THEY CAN PUSH TOGETHER. 
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY SOMEONE 
WHO IS PUSHING THE AGENDA OF 
THE WHITE HOUSE, AND THAT WAS 
WHAT NIKKI HALEY CONTINUED TO 
DO TIME AND TIME AGAIN. 
AND SHE OFTEN GOT POINTS FROM 
THIS WHITE HOUSE FOR HOW TOUGH 
SHE WAS AGAINST LEADERS ON THE 
INTERNATIONAL STAGE WHO WEREN'T 
IN LINE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
SHE SAID AT ONE POINT, YOU 
KNOW, WE ARE TAKING NAMES WHEN 
THAT DECISION WAS MADE ABOUT 
MOVING THE EMBASSY IN ISRAEL 
AND WORLD LEADERS CAME OUT 
AGAINST TRUMP. 
SHE BASICALLY WAS THREATENING 
THAT IF YOU ARE NOT SUPPORTIVE 
OF THE POLICY OF THIS WHITE 
HOUSE, YOU BETTER GET READY 
BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE 
SOMETHING COMING YOUR WAY WHICH 
ISN'T GOING TO BE SO GREAT. 
SO SHE WASN'T AFRAID TO MAKE IT 
A POLITICAL POSITION, AND THAT 
IS WHAT IS A BIT DIFFERENT 
ABOUT HER AND HOW SHE DECIDED 
TO APPROACH THIS ROLE. 
>> SO WE DO KNOW THAT THE PRESS 
HAS LEFT THE OVAL OFFICE AND 
THEY ARE GOING TO BE FEEDING 
TAPE BACK, SO WE CAN LISTEN IN 
TO THE EVENT THAT JUST PLAYED 
OUT THERE IN THE OVAL OFFICE 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND A 
FORMER U.N. AMBASSADOR NIKKI 
HALEY. 
SHE'S SET TO RESIGN AT THE END 
OF THIS YEAR. 
ON THE PHONE WITH US IS 
REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST LESLIE 
SANCHEZ WHO JOINED OUR 
CONVERSATION. 
AND, YOU KNOW, LESLIE, I NEVER 
GOT TO ASK YOU, BUT WAS THERE 
ANY -- DID YOU HAVE ANY 
INDICATION THAT THIS WOULD 
HAPPEN? 
>> NO. 
I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S 
SURPRISING. 
IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE SHE 
TOLD HER STAFF THIS MORNING. 
FOR MANY WHO WONDERED ABOUT 
NIKKI HALEY IN THE CABINET FROM 
THE BEGINNING AFTER THE 
PRESIDENT'S WIN IN 2016, IT WAS 
ALWAYS A QUESTION OF HOW THE 
DYNAMIC WOULD WORK TOGETHER, 
ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE WAS SOME 
CONTENTION IN THE 2016 
PRESIDENTIAL. 
SHE HAD SIDED WITH MARCO RUBIO 
AS HER CANDIDATE. 
AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE 
MARCO RUBIO EVEN DEFENDED HER 
EARLIER THIS YEAR WHEN SHE RAN 
INTO SOME POLITICAL PROBLEMS, 
HE CAME OUT TO HER DEFENSE. 
AND SO THE ALLIANCES WERE 
ALWAYS DIFFERENT AND THE 
PRESIDENT IS BIG ON LOYALTY. 
SO THE INTERESTING PART IS THAT 
SHE WAITED UNTIL THAT TWO-YEAR 
MARK AND THAT'S KIND OF A FUNNY 
IN -- IN POLITICS THAT'S A 
FUNNY TERM BECAUSE YOU DO YOUR 
TIME, IT'S A BIT OF SERVICE. 
úY 
THEN YOU GO DO SOMETHING ELSE. 
SO I FEEL SHE WAS A GOOD 
SOLDIER AND A GOOD -- A MEMBER 
FOR THE PRESIDENT IN SHARING 
HER OPINION AND IT WAS OFTEN A 
DIFFERING OPINION. 
AND SHE'S STRONG ENOUGH TO 
STAND THERE AND EXPRESS THAT TO 
THE PRESIDENT AND STILL SUPPORT 
HIS IDEALS AND BE THAT 
POLITICAL ROLE THAT WE JUST 
TALKED ABOUT, THAT'S A VERY 
UNIQUE BLEND. 
>> GO AHEAD, CAITLIN. 
>> JUST TO PICK UP ON THAT 
POINT, IT HAS BEEN VERY 
úINTERE 
HALEY REALLY BE UNAFRAID IN 
CARVING OUT HER OWN IDENTITY 
AND IN MAKING CLEAR WHEN SHE 
DISAGREES WITH THE PRESIDENT 
AND THE ADMINISTRATION. 
REMEMBER JUST RECENTLY WHEN 
THERE WAS TALK OF ADDITIONAL 
SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA, LARRY 
CUDLOW, THE PRESIDENT'S 
ECONOMIC ADVISER SAID THAT 
NIKKI HALEY WHO HAD JUST BEEN 
ON THE SUNDAY SHOWS TALKING 
ABOUT IT MAY HAVE BEEN CONFUSED 
AND SHE HAD RESPONDED I DON'T 
GET CONFUSED. 
AND SO SHE HAS BEEN UNABASHED 
ABOUT STICKING UP FOR HERSELF 
IN THIS ADMINISTRATION, AND, 
AGAIN, REALLY FORGING AHEAD 
WITH HER OWN IDENTITY HERE. 
AND I THINK IT'S REALLY 
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AS WE'RE 
LOOKING AT THE POOL REPORTS 
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE 
PRESIDENT'S -- THE WAY IN WHICH 
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT NIKKI HALEY, SAYING THAT 
SHE HAS BEEN VERY SPECIAL TO 
ME, SHE HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE 
JOB, SHE'S A FANTASTIC PERSON, 
SHE GETS IT, SHE TOLD ME SIX 
MONTHS AGO THAT MAYBE AT THE 
END OF THE YEAR SHE WANTED TO 
TAKE A BREAK, IF IN FACT NIKKI 
HALEY HAS POLITICAL AMBITIONS 
OR IS REALLY SERIOUSLY THINKING 
ABOUT THEM GOING AHEAD, THAT 
SUPPORT FROM THE PRESIDENT 
LEAVING ON GOOD TERMS FROM THIS 
WHITE HOUSE WOULD BE CRITICAL 
IN TERMS OF KIND OF BUILDING 
THAT SUPPORT. 
BUT I 
SPEAKERS SHE HAS YOUNG CHILDREN,
OF COURSE THIS IS A STRENUOUS 
JOB.
>> LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT 
HAPPENED IN THE OVAL OFFICE.
>>> WE HAVE A HURRICANE COMING, 
NORTH CAROLINA, SOUTH GALENA, 
TEXAS, FLORIDA, PUERTO RICO, 
SONY PLACES, WE HAVE ANOTHER 
ONE COMING, A BIG ONE, MUCH 
BIGGER THAN THE ANTICIPATED 
DACHSHUND THEY ANTICIPATED A 
WEEK AGO, I HEARD THERE WAS A 
DROP OF WEATHER THAT WAS 
FORMING, THAT IS NOW ALMOST A 
CATEGORY 3, FEMA IS READY, WE 
ARE ALREADY, I SPOKE WITH 
GOVERNOR SCOTT, I SPOKE WITH 
EVERYBODY THAT YOU NEED TO 
SPEAK TO, AND I THINK THAT 
HOPEFULLY YOU GET LUCKY, BUT 
MAYBE THAT WON'T HAPPEN, BUT WE 
ARE PREPARED.>>> I WANTED TO DO 
THIS BECAUSE NIKKI HALEY, 
AMBASSADOR TO THE UNITED 
NATIONS, HAS BEEN VERY SPECIAL 
TO ME, SHE HAS DONE A INCREDIBLE
JOB, SHE IS A FANTASTIC PERSON, 
SHE ALSO IS SOMEBODY WHO GETS 
IT, AT THE UNITED NATIONS, FROM 
THE BEGINNING WITH US, FROM THE 
BEGINNING, AND WORKED WITH US 
FROM THE CAMPAIGN, IT HAS BEEN 
VERY INTENSE, SHE TOLD ME SIX 
MONTHS AGO PROBABLY, MAY BE AT 
THE END OF THE YEAR, AT THE END 
OF A TWO-YEAR PERIOD, THE END 
OF THE YEAR, I WANT TO TAKE A 
LITTLE BIT OF TIME OFF, SHE HAS 
BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL, AS 
GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA, FOR 
EIGHT YEARS, AND THEN SHE DID 
THIS, AND THIS HAS POSSIBLY 
BEEN MORE INTENSE WITH WHAT IS 
GOING ON IN THE WORLD, VERY 
DANGEROUS, A LOT OF THINGS. 
SHE HAS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB, 
WE HAVE DONE A FANTASTIC JOB 
TOGETHER, WE HAVE SOLVED A LOT 
OF PROBLEMS AND IN THE PROCESS 
OF SOLVING A LOT OF PROBLEMS, 
AT THE BEGINNING NORTH KOREA 
WAS A MASSIVE PROBLEM AND WE 
ARE MOVING ALONG, IT IS MOVING 
ALONG REALLY NICELY. 
I CAN SPEAK FOR SECRETARY OF 
STATE MIKE POMPEO, HE THINKS 
THE WORLD OF NIKKI HALEY, SO WE 
ARE ALL HAPPY FOR YOU IN ONE 
WAY, BUT WE HE TO YOU LOSE YOU, 
HOPEFULLY YOU'LL BE COMING BACK 
AT SOME LIKE I MAY BE DIFFERENT 
CAPACITY, YOU CAN HAVE YOUR 
PICK. 
AT THE END OF THE YEAR, SHE 
WILL BE LEAVING, AND WE WILL BE 
IN CONSTANT TOUCH, WHENEVER YOU 
HAVE ANY IDEAS, YOU'RE GOING TO 
CALL ME, BECAUSE YOU KNOW ALL 
THE PLAYERS, THAT'S ONE OF THE 
BEST THINGS SHE DID AT THE 
UNITED NATIONS, SHE HAD TO KNOW 
CHINA, RUSSIA, INDIA, SHE KNOWS 
EVERYBODY ON A FIRST NAME 
BASIS, AND THEY LIKE OR. 
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE A COUPLE, 
WHICH IS NORMAL, BUT THEY 
REALLY DO LIKE HER, AND MORE 
IMPORTANTLY, THEY RESPECT HER. 
SO NIKKI, I WANT TO TELL YOU, 
THAT WE WILL MISS YOU, WE WILL 
SPEAK WITH YOU, YOU HAVE DONE A 
FANTASTIC JOB,  AND I WANT TO 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.>> THANK 
YOU. 
I WANT TO SAY FIRST OF ALL, I 
WANT TO THINK THE PRESIDENT, 
FOR ALLOWING US TO COME OUT AND 
TALK TO YOU THIS WAY, IT HAS 
BEEN AN HONOR OF A LIFETIME, I 
SAID I'M SUCH A LUCKY GIRL TO 
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEAVE THE 
STATE THAT RAISED ME, AND TO 
SERVE A COUNTRY I LOVE SO VERY 
MUCH. 
IT HAS REALLY BEEN A BLESSING 
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 
THAT. 
BUT I AM MOST EXCITED WITH THE 
TWO YEARS, LOOK AT WHAT IS 
HAPPENED IN TWO YEARS WITH THE 
UNITED STATES ON FOREIGN 
POLICY, NOW THE UNITED STATES 
IS RESPECTED, COUNTRIES MAY NOT 
LIKE WHAT WE DO, BUT THEY 
RESPECT WHAT WE DO, WE KNOW -- 
THEY KNOW THAT IF WE SAY WE ARE 
GOING TO DO SOMETHING, WE 
FOLLOW THROUGH, WHETHER IT IS 
WITH CHEMICAL WEAPONS IN SYRIA, 
WITH NATO, SAYING OTHER 
COUNTRIES HAVE TO PAY THEIR 
SHARE, TRADE DEALS, WHICH HAVE 
BEEN AMAZING, THEY GET THAT THE 
PRESIDENT MEANS BUSINESS, BUT 
IF YOU LOOK AT THESE TWO YEARS 
IN THE UN, WE'VE CUT $1.3 
BILLION IN THE UN'S BUDGET CUP 
WE'VE MADE IT STRONGER, MORE 
EFFICIENT. 
SOUTH SUDAN, WE GOT AN ARMS 
EMBARGO, WHICH WAS A LONG TIME 
COMING, THREE NORTH KOREAN 
SANCTIONS PACKAGES, THE MOST IN 
A GENERATION, MOVING TOWARDS 
THE NUCLEAR RISING NORTH KOREA. 
-- DENUCLEARIZING NORTH KOREA. 
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE NT 
ISRAEL BIAS, AND THE STRENGTH 
AND SHOWING THE REST OF THE 
WORLD, WE WILL SHOW THE WORLD 
WE WILL I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE 
U.S. IS STRONG AGAIN, IT IS 
STRONG IN A WAY THAT SHOULD 
MAKE ALL AMERICANS VERY PROUD, 
AND I WANT TO SAY IT'S NOT JUST 
THE PRESIDENT I WANT TO THINK, 
THE FAMILY IN GENERAL, THE 
FIRST LADY HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT 
VERY KIND TO ME, I CAN'T SAY 
ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT JARED 
KUSHNER AND YVONNE, -- IVANKA. 
JARED KUSHNER IS SUCH A GENIUS 
THE PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE, 
WORKING ON THE NAFTA PLAN, AND 
IVANKA, THEY DO MORE BEHIND THE 
SCENES, THAT I WISH MORE PEOPLE 
KNEW ABOUT, WE ARE A BETTER 
COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE 
ADMINISTRATION, I HAVE TO SAY 
THANK YOU TO MY FAMILY, MICHAEL 
IS A SAINT, AND BY TWO LITTLE 
ONES, I ADORE THEM, AND TO TEAM 
US UN, THEY PUT A LOT OF HEART 
IN IT, AND REALLY WANTED TO 
MAKE AMERICA PROUD, WITH THAT, 
I'M NOT LEAVING UNTIL THE END 
OF THE YEAR, MY GOAL IS THAT WE 
MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS IN 
PLACE FOR THE NEXT AMBASSADOR 
TO COME IN, BUT IT IS A GREAT 
DAY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND 
I'M PROUD TO HAVE BEEN PART OF 
A TEAM, NOW I DON'T HAVE 
ANYTHING SET ON WHERE I'M GOING 
TO GO, I THINK THE MAIN THING 
WAS, I WAS GOVERNOR FOR SIX 
YEARS, WE DEALT WITH A 
HURRICANE, THOUSAND YEAR FLOOD, 
A CHURCH SHOOTING, THERE WAS 
LOT, AND DUE TO YEARS OF 
RUSSIA, IRAN AND NORTH KOREA, 
IT HAS BEEN EIGHT YEARS OF 
INTENSE TIME, I'M A BELIEVER IN 
TERM LIMITS, I THINK YOU HAVE 
TO BE SELFLESS TO KNOW WHEN YOU 
STEP ASIDE AND ALLOW SOMEONE 
ELSE TO DO THE JOB. 
THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT, IT HAS 
BEEN AN HONORABLE LIFETIME, FOR 
ALL OF YOU ASKING ABOUT 2020, 
NO I AM NOT RUNNING FOR 2020, 
WHAT I WILL BE DOING IS 
CAMPAIGNING FOR THIS ONE, I 
WILL SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT IN 
THE NEXT ELECTION.>> THANK YOU, 
NIKKI. 
>> YOU LISTED OFF A LONG LIST 
OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS , WHY WOULD 
YOU WANT TO LEAVE THAT BEHIND? 
IS IT A PERSONAL DECISION 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN AWAY FROM 
YOUR FAMILY FOR SO LONG? 
>> MY FAMILY HAS BEEN 
SUPPORTIVE, THERE IS NOT THAT 
REASON, BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR 
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO KNOW 
WHEN IT'S TIME TO STEP ASIDE, I 
HAVE GIVEN EVERYTHING I'VE GOT 
THESE LAST EIGHT YEARS, I THINK 
THAT SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD TO 
ROTATE IN OTHER PEOPLE WHO CAN 
PUT THE SAME ENERGY AND POWER 
INTO IT, A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL 
SAY THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS 
WHY I'M LEAVING, THE TRUTH IS, 
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS 
ADMINISTRATION, THE PRESIDENT 
HAS ANOTHER PERSON TO FIGHT, 
GOING INTO BODY -- THE UN WITH 
BODY ARMOR EVERY DAY TO DEFEND 
AMERICA, I WILL NEVER TRULY 
STEP ASIDE FOR -- FROM FIGHTING 
FOR MY COUNTRY, IT IS MY TIME. 
>> WHY MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT 
NOW? 
BIGGER SHE WILL BE STAYING 
UNTIL -- >> SHE WILL BE STAYING 
UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, 
WHICH WILL BE TWO YEARS, I WAS 
THINKING WHEN WE CAME INTO 
OFFICE, IT WAS ALMOST 
INEVITABLE IN THE MINDS OF MANY 
THAT WE WERE GOING TO WAR WITH 
NORTH KOREA, IF YOU ASKED 
PRESIDENT OBAMA, HE SAID THAT 
WAS HIS BIGGEST PROBLEM WHEN WE 
SET MET RIGHT HERE, THAT LOOKS 
LIKE A REAL PROBLEM, IRAN LOOK 
LIKE A REAL PROBLEM, -- LOOKED 
LIKE A REAL PROBLEM, AND NOW 
THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR 
LIVES, THEY'VE GOT RIGHTS IN 
THEIR CITIES, THE INFLATION, 
THE ECONOMY IS IN TATTERS, AND 
AT SOME POINT THEY WILL 
PROBABLY WANT TO COME AND MAKE 
A REAL DEAL, NOT THE RIDICULOUS 
DEAL THAT THEY MADE, THAT WAS 
UNACCEPTABLE FOR ME, WOULD IT 
DIFFERENCE, WHEN WE FIRST CAME, 
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THE DAY 
BEFORE WE CAME, IF YOU LOOK AT 
NORTH KOREA, THERE WAS A DEAL, 
SOMETHING THAT WAS A 
POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING PROBLEM,
AND THE RELATIONSHIPS ARE VERY 
GOOD, SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE 
POMPEO JUST LEFT, HAD A GREAT 
MEETING, AND ALSO WAS IN CHINA, 
AND SPOKE TO MANY OF THE ASIAN 
LEADERS, WHO WENT THERE, A 
REALLY GOOD MEETING WITH NORTH 
KOREA, AND CHAIRMAN KIM, AND 
PROGRESS ON SO MANY OTHER 
FRONTS ALSO, AND THE WORLD IS 
REALLY RESPECTING THE UNITED 
STATES AGAIN, MUCH MORE SO THAN 
THEY HAVE IN MANY DECADES. 
WE ARE RESPECTED AGAIN, THAT I 
CAN TELL YOU, VERY MUCH 
RESPECTED AGAIN, PEOPLE WANT TO 
BE ON OUR SIDE, EVEN IF YOU 
LOOK AT THE VOTES IN THE UNITED 
NATIONS, WE ARE GETTING VERY 
STRONG VOTES NOW. 
I WANT TO THINK NIKKI, THIS 
WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO 
DO IT, BECAUSE WHEN YOU WRITE 
OUT ON A PIECE PAPER, THAT 
INVESTOR NIKKI HALEY WILL BE 
LEAVING, WHEN YOU REALLY THINK 
SOMEBODY HAS DONE A TERRIFIC 
JOB, IS TO THINK THE INVESTOR, 
I JUST WANT TO THINK NIKKI, 
OKAY? 
IT'S A GREAT POSITION, SHE 
REALIZES IT, AND SHE HAS HELPED 
MAKE IT A MUCH BETTER POSITION, 
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH, 
IT HAS BECOME MAY BE A MORE 
GLAMOROUS POSITION THAN IT WAS 
TWO YEARS AGO, I WONDER WHY, 
BUT IT IS, SHE HAS MADE IT A 
GLAMOROUS POSITION, SHE HAS 
MADE IT A MORE IMPORTANT 
POSITION, SO WE HAVE -- I CAN 
ALMOST SAY MANY PEOPLE THAT 
WANT TO DO, THEY ARE VERY GOOD 
PEOPLE, I WILL BE TALKING ALSO 
TO NIKKI ABOUT THAT, THE 
GENERAL ABOUT THAT, WE HAVE 
MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY 
INTERESTED IN DOING IT.
>> WITH MIKE POMPEO, ARE YOU 
FRUSTRATED BY THE LACK OF 
ACTUAL ANNOUNCEMENTS?>> NOT 
ONLY AM I NOT FRUSTRATED, IT'S 
INCREDIBLE, WHO ARE YOU WITH?
>> FRIENDS.
>> FOR 80 YEARS WE COULD DO A 
THING, WE ARE IN THREE MONTHS 
OF NEGOTIATION, IT'S 
RIDICULOUS, AS I'VE SAID ABOUT 
THOUSAND TIMES, YOU HAVE NO 
RUCKUS FLYING, NO MISSILES 
FLYING, NO NUCLEAR TESTING, YOU 
HAVE NUCLEAR CLOSINGS, CLOSING 
UP DIFFERENT AREAS OF NORTH 
KOREA, WE ARE GETTING REMAINS 
BACK, OF OUR GREAT HEROES, WE 
GOT OUR HOSTAGES BACK, AND I 
DIDN'T PAY ONE $.8 BILLION LIKE 
THE PREVIOUS A MINISTRATION, I 
PAID NOTHING. 
BUT I HAVE AGREED TO MEET, AND 
I HAVE AGREED TO SPEND TIME, 
BUT HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE 
WE LEFT SINGAPORE, ABOUT THREE 
MONTHS OR SO, AND PEOPLE SAY, 
THE MEDIA SAYS, HOW CAN WE BE 
NEGATIVE, HE'S DONE REALLY 
WELL, ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED WITH 
THIS, I THINK THE SPEED IS 
AMAZING, NO NUCLEAR TEST, NO 
ROCKETS, A VERY GOOD RELATION 
-- RELATIONSHIP WITH CHAIRMAN 
KIM, I LIKE HIM, HE LIKES ME, 
THE RELATIONSHIP IS GOOD, MIKE 
POMPEO HAD A VERY GOOD MEETING, 
I SPOKE TO THEM AT LENGTH 
YESTERDAY, HE WILL BE BACK 
TONIGHT, AND SO I MEAN, JUST 
THE OPPOSITE, I THINK WE HAVE 
MADE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS. 
INCREDIBLE. 
SOME OF THE PRESS, COVERS IT 
ACCURATELY AND RIGHT, BUT SOME 
OF IT DOESN'T.
>> DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS 
OPPORTUNITY TO LET US KNOW WHEN 
YOUR NEXT MEETING WITH KIM WILL 
BE? 
>> WE ARE SETTING THIS UP NOW, 
THAT WAS PART OF THE REASON 
MIKE WAS GOING OVER TO MEET, WE 
WILL BE ANNOUNCING THAT 
PROBABLY AT A DIFFERENT 
LOCATION, SINGAPORE WAS 
FANTASTIC, BUT WE PROBABLY WILL 
DO A DIFFERENT LOCATION.>> MAR-
A-LAGO?
>> HE PROBABLY WOULD LIKE THAT, 
I LIKE THAT, TOO, WE WILL TALK 
ABOUT THREE OR FOUR LOCATIONS, 
TIMING WILL BE FAR AWAY. 
PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THE 
IMPORTANCE OF THE FIRST MEETING,
WE SAID POINT NUMBER 1, 
DENUCLEARIZATION, THEY HAVE 
AGREED TO THAT, THEY CONTINUE 
TO, AND WE HAVEN'T REMOVED 
SANCTIONS, PEOPLE SAID WOULD'VE 
WE DONE, WE DON'T HAVE 
SANCTIONS REMOVED, I WOULD LOVE 
TO, BUT WE HAVE TO GET 
SOMETHING FOR THAT.
>> ANY CHANCE IT WILL BE ON 
U.S. SOIL? 
>> I DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS 
ANYBODY BASKING, EVENTUALLY WE 
WILL HAVE LOTS OF MEETINGS ON 
U.S. SOIL, AND ON THEIR SOIL BY 
THE WAY, A TWO WE -- A TWO-WAY 
STREET. 
I THINK THE COUNTRY OF NORTH 
KOREA WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL 
COUNTRY, I THINK IT WILL BE 
INCREDIBLY ECONOMIC SUCCESSFUL, 
I WANT TO MAKE IT THAT WAY, I 
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD, 
OTHER COUNTRIES, OTHER PEOPLE, 
ENTREPRENEURS, BANKS, I WILL 
TELL YOU, THEY ARE CALLING 
WANTING TO GO THERE AND INVEST 
AT SOME POINT. 
WHEN CHAIRMAN KIM MAKES THAT 
DECISION, I THINK HE WILL 
UNLEASH SOMETHING THAT WILL BE 
SPECTACULAR. 
REALLY SPECTACULAR, AND I THINK 
HE KNOWS IT, AND I THINK THAT'S 
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE ARE 
HAVING SUCCESSFUL 
CONVERSATIONS, I THINK HE WANTS 
TO GET ON WITH IT.>> WHEN WILL 
A SUCCESSOR BE NAMED?
>> I A WILL SAY WE WILL NAME A 
SUCCESSOR WITHIN THE NEXT TWO 
OR THREE WEEKS. 
MAY BE SOONER. 
>> HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO THE 
SAUDI'S?
>> I HAVE NOT BUT I WILL BE.
>> WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO 
HILLARY CLINTON SAYING THAT 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH SWEARINGEN WAS 
MORE OF A POLITICAL STATEMENT 
THAN A CEREMONIAL ONE? 
>> HILLARY NEVER GOT IT, AND 
THAT IS WHY SHE LOST.
>> WHAT IS YOUR PREDICTION FOR 
THE GOP? 
HOW IS YOUR STAMINA FOR THE 
CAMPAIGN TRAIL? 
>> IF THERE IS A 5% DROP OFF, 
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH 
THE PRESIDENT, YOU WOULD SAY, 
BUT I'M GOING TO IOWA TONIGHT, 
WE HAVE A BIG CROWD, I'M GOING 
TO MAKE A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT 
TONIGHT AND I WOULD. 
WE ARE GOING TO BE MAKING A 
VERY BIG ANNOUNCEMENT, AND I 
HAVE TO SAY, THE FARMERS, ARE 
ARE SO THRILLED WITH THE USMCA, 
I DON'T SEE NAFTA, WE LOST 
THOUSANDS OF FACTORIES AND 
PLANTS, BAD FOR FARMERS, IT'S 
ONLY GONE DOWN, THEY ARE GOING 
TO GO UP, WE OPENED UP MEXICO, 
WE'LL PUT UP CANADA, AND IT IS 
GREAT FOR OUR FARMERS. 
BUT I'M GOING TO I WOULD 
TONIGHT, AND WE WILL BE TALKING 
A LITTLE ETHANOL TONIGHT, GOT 
SOME GREAT THINGS PLANNED. 
SPEAKING OF THAT, I WILL SAY, 
IF YOU LOOK AT INDUSTRIES, THE 
STEEL INDUSTRY IN THIS COUNTRY 
IS BACK LIKE NOTHING I'VE EVER 
SEEN BEFORE. 
IN A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS, 
SINCE WE STARTED DOING WHAT 
WE'VE BEEN DOING, THE STEEL 
INDUSTRY HAS LITERALLY REVIVED, 
IT PLANS, OPENING UP, IN OUR 
COUNTRY IT IS REALLY HOT, IT 
HAS REALLY BEEN GREAT, I WILL 
BE GOING TO IOWA TONIGHT.
>> HOW DID THE MEETING WITH 
MIKE POMPEO GO WITH CHINA? 
>> VERY WELL, THEY TOOK $500 
BILLION EVERY YEAR, PEOPLE 
SHOULD'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
THIS IN THE CHAIR FOR MANY 
YEARS, -- $500 MILLION. 
THEY WERE TAKING OUT EVEN 200 
BILLION, $300 BILLION AND $400 
BILLION PER YEAR, WE HOPE TO 
REBUILD CHINA, IF WE DIDN'T DO 
THAT, THEY ARE NOT WHERE THEY 
WOULD BE, BUT WE ARE NOT DOING 
IT ANY LONGER.
>> ARE YOU GOING FORWARD WITH 
THE TEARS? 
>> WHAT DOES RETALIATE MEAN? 
THEY'VE ALREADY RETALIATED, 
THEY'VE TAKEN OUT $500 BILLION, 
THAT IS THE ULTIMATE 
RETALIATION, CHINA WANTS TO 
MAKE A DEAL, AND I SAY THEY ARE 
NOT READY YET. 
I JUST SAY THEY'RE NOT READY 
YET. 
WE HAVE CANCELED A COUPLE OF 
MEETINGS, BECAUSE I SAY THEY 
ARE NOT READY TO MAKE A DEAL, 
WE CAN'T HAVE A ONE-WAY STREET, 
IT'S GOT TO BE A TWO-WAY STREET,
IT'S BEEN A ONE-WAY STREET FOR 
25 YEARS, WE'VE GOT TO MAKE IT 
A TWO-WAY STREET, WE'VE GOT TO 
BENEFIT ALSO. 
THANK YOU. 
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? 
>>> I WANT TO FINISH, THIS IS 
THE PURE REASON FOR THIS IS 
NIKKI, YOU HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC, 
YOU'RE MY FRIEND, ON BEHALF OF 
THE COUNTRY, I WANT TO THANK 
YOU FOR GREAT JOB. 
THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYBODY. 
>>> THERE YOU HAVE IT, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND NIKKI 
HALEY, WHO JUST RESIGNED TODAY, 
NOTHING BUT PRAISE FOR THE TWO, 
LISTENING FOR 20 MINUTES TO 
THEIR REMARKS, A TEAM OF 
CORRESPONDENTS COVERING THIS 
BREAKING DEVELOPMENT OUT OF 
WASHINGTON. 
HERE IN NEW YORK IS CAITLIN 
HUEY-BURNS, KYLIE ATWOOD,  
PAULA REID AT THE WHITE HOUSE, 
AND ON THE PHONE, REPUBLICAN 
STRATEGIST LESLIE SANCHEZ. 
PAULA, I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE 
AWAY FROM THIS, WE HEARD SO 
MUCH PRAISE BETWEEN THE TWO, 
BUT SOMETHING THAT STOOD OUT TO 
ME WAS WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP 
SAID TO NIKKI, MAYBE YOU WILL 
COME BACK IN A DIFFERENT 
CAPACITY, YOU CAN HAVE YOUR 
PICK? 
>> QUITE A TEASE THERE, THIS 
WAS A VERY DIGNIFIED DEPARTURE, 
EVERYONE THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE 
A VICTORY LAP FOR THE PRESIDENT,
AFTER SWEARING IN HIS SECOND 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, BUT THE 
NEWS CAME OUT THAT NIKKI HALEY 
WAS GOING TO TENDER HER 
RESIGNATION, AND IN A HASTILY 
ARRANGED PRESS CONFERENCE, THEY 
COULD HAVE A DIGNIFIED 
DEPARTURE, HE CALLED HER 
FANTASTIC, HE SAID SHE HAD DONE 
A INCREDIBLE JOB, AND THEIR 
STORY IS THAT SHE SAID ABOUT 
SIX MONTHS AGO THAT SHE WANTED 
TO DEPART, BUT NOT UNTIL THE 
END OF THE YEAR, SHE WANTED TO 
DEPART AT ABOUT THE TWO-YEAR 
MARK, AND HE SAID HE WILL 
ANNOUNCE HER SUCCESSOR IN TWO 
OR THREE WEEKS, BUT ONE BIG 
POINT IS, SHE IS NOT 
CAMPAIGNING, SO SHE SAYS, IN 
2020, AND WILL BE SUPPORTING 
THE PRESIDENT AND CAMPAIGNING 
ON HIS BEHALF, THIS IS ONE OF 
THE ONLY HIGH PROFILE WOMEN IN 
THE PRESIDENT'S CABINET.>> AND 
I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR TAKE ON 
THIS, CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS, SHE 
SAYS SHE HAS BEEN WORKING FOR 
EIGHT YEARS, WITH A VERY 
INTENSE RUN, GOVERNOR OF SOUTH 
CAROLINA,  TWO YEARS AT THE UN, 
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT? 
BECAUSE THE TIMING IS 
INTERESTING, SHE TALKED ABOUT 
HOW LONG SHE HAS BEEN IN 
POLITICS, THIS KIND OF JOB IS 
EXTREMELY STRENUOUS, NOT ONLY IN
TERMS OF THE ACTUAL TIME, BUT 
THE PLAYERS INVOLVED, AND 
BECOMING A PROFESSIONAL ON THE 
ISSUE OF FOREIGN POLICY WHEN YOU
ARE A FORMER GOVERNOR, A LOT 
SHE HAS DONE, AND SHE TICKED 
OFF A LIST OF WHAT SHE BELIEVES 
TO BE HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS, BUT 
WE ARE COMING RIGHT OFF THE 
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WANTS TO USE AS A 
SELLING POINT IN THE MIDTERMS, 
CONTINUING TO RALLY THE TROOPS 
AROUND REPUBLICANS, AND A MONTH 
AWAY FROM THE MIDTERMS, SO 
HAVING THIS KIND OF SHAKEUP IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOT 
SOMETHING THAT TYPICALLY AN 
ADMINISTRATION WOULD ONE JUST A 
MONTH BEFORE THE MIDTERMS, SO 
IT DOES RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT 
WHY NOW, WHY NOT DO IT A FEW 
WEEKS FROM NOW ONCE THE 
MIDTERMS ARE OVER, ESPECIALLY 
SINCE SHE SAID SHE WAS TO STAY 
IN OF THE YEAR, BUT SHE SAID 
SHE'S NOT GOING TO CHALLENGE 
THE PRESIDENT, SHE PLANS TO 
CAMPAIGN FOR HIM IN 2020, BUT 
WE CAN'T ASSUME SHE WON'T BE 
AROUND POLITICS FOR A WHILE.
>> THAT WAS THE HEADLINE, SHE 
WILL CAMPAIGN FOR HIM IN 2020. 
ON THE PHONE IS LESLIE SANCHEZ, 
WEIGH IN HERE, WHAT ARE YOUR 
THOUGHTS AFTER LISTENING TO 
THIS, AND ALSO ABOUT HALEY'S 
POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS?
>> I THINK KAITLIN HAS IT 
EXACTLY RIGHT, TIME IS ON NIKKI 
HALEY SIDE, NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF 
THE OPENING IT WILL CREATE IN 
THE STATE, BUT SHE SAID A FEW 
INTERESTING THINGS, ASIDE FROM 
A VERY GRACIOUS EXIT, THAT HAS 
THE PRESENCE PRAISE, AND THAT 
IN ITSELF DESERVES A GOLD 
RIBON, AND THAT IS PRETTY 
DIFFICULT TO GET, SHE SAID I 
BELIEVE IN TERM LIMITS, COMING 
FROM A STATE WHERE THE LATE 
STROM THURMOND WAS A SENATOR 
FOR 48 YEARS, THAT NEVER 
CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
ADVANCE IN THE STATE, SHE GREW 
UP IN A STATE THAT 
FUNDAMENTALLY SHE UNDERSTOOD 
YOU HAVE TO CREATE 
OPPORTUNITIES, AND SHE MAKES 
THE POINT TO SAY YOU ARE 
SELFLESS ENOUGH TO EXIT, THAT 
IS A VERY HARD THING, 
ESPECIALLY WITH SOMEONE 
WIELDING SUCH TREMENDOUS 
POLITICAL POWER, IT SPEAKS TO 
HER TENACITY, HER VISION, AND 
WHERE SHE IS AIMING, SHE IS 
SOMEONE WHO CAN MAKE VERY TOUGH 
CHOICES FOR HER FAMILY AND 
STAND STRONG, AND SHE WAS THE 
ONE WHO HAD TO DEFEND THE 
PRESIDENT DURING THE PARIS 
ACCORD, AND STILL MANAGES TO 
SAY THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL,
IT WAS THESE POLITICAL ISSUES 
WITH OPPORTUNITY, SHE MANAGES 
TO COME OUT AHEAD, SHE IS 
DEFINITELY ONE TO WATCH.
>> KYLIE, WE HEARD HIM SAY HE 
WILL NAME A SUCCESSOR WITHIN 
THE NEXT TWO OR THREE WEEKS 
BEFORE THE MIDTERMS, WHAT STOOD 
OUT TO YOU DURING THAT MEETING 
BETWEEN THE TWO?>> I THINK 
PAULA PUT IT WELL WHEN SHE 
TALKED ABOUT HOW WELL THIS ONE 
FOR EACH OTHER, THEY WERE 
ADORNING EACH OTHER WITH 
OMPLIMENTS, A WELL 
ORCHESTRATED EXIT, I THINK THIS 
SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO NIKKI 
HALEY'S POLITICAL ACUMEN, SHE 
KNOWS HOW TO WORK THIS, AND NOT 
MAKE IT SEEM LIKE THERE IS ANY 
BAD BLOOD BETWEEN THE TWO, SO 
SHE CAN PUSH FORWARD 
INDEPENDENTLY. 
THE BIG QUESTION IS, WHAT IS 
SHE GOING TO DO, AND WHO IS 
GOING TO STEP INTO THIS ROLE? 
I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT ONE 
NAME THAT WILL BE FLOATED OUT 
THERE IS THE FORMER DEPUTY 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR DENA 
POWELL, SHE LEFT THE 
ADMINISTRATION AFTER SERVING IN 
THE DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY 
ROLE FOR A YEAR, AND THEN SHE 
WENT BACK TO GOLDMAN SACHS, BUT 
SHE HAS STILL REMAINED A CLOSE 
ALLY OF THE PRESIDENT, AND WHEN 
SHE LEFT, THERE WERE ALSO 
POSITIVE WORDS THRUST ON HER. 
TRUMP AT THAT POINT SAID THAT 
SHE HAD SAGE ADVICE, SHE HAD 
BEEN AN INVALUABLE MEMBER OF 
THE TEAM, AND WE JUST SAW ON 
TWITTER, THAT NIKKI HALEY OVER 
THE WEEKEND SPENT THE WEEKEND 
IN SOUTH CAROLINA, AND WHO WAS 
THERE? 
DENA POWELL. 
SOMEONE TO KEEP AN EYE ON. 
>> I KNOW YOU WORKED WITH DENA 
POWELL, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING? 
>> HER NAME HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
FLOATED AROUND, SHE IS ONE OF 
THE MOST RESPECTED, HIGHLY 
REGARDED WOMEN IN POLITICS, 
BECAUSE OF HER KIND OF FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS ACUMEN, BUT ALSO 
SOMEONE WHO REALLY KNOWS HOW TO 
GET THINGS DONE, AND BRINGS 
TOGETHER INFLUENCERS TO MAKE 
CHANGE, SHE DID IT IN THE 
GOVERNMENT TO BRING IN -- BY 
BRING IN PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHO MAY 
NOT HAVE WANTED TO WORK IN THE 
BUSH MINISTRATION, SHE BROUGHT 
THEM IN, SO THE PRESIDENT WOULD 
HAVE A BROAD ARRAY OF IDEAS 
THAT WERE COUNTER TO THE 
PRESIDENTS THINKING. 
AND AT GOLDMAN SACHS, SHE HAD A 
MASSIVE CAPACITY TO BRING WOMEN 
TOGETHER TO LOOK AT ISSUES 
BEYOND CULTURAL AFFAIRS, BUT 
ECONOMIC ISSUES, KIND OF 
EMPOWERMENT ISSUES, ACCESS TO 
CAPITAL, A VARIETY OF THINGS, 
SO SHE IS A REAL POWERHOUSE 
THAT YOU ALWAYS WANT TO KEEP IN 
THE BACK OF YOUR MIND, AND 
ANYONE WOULD BE EXCITED TO HAVE 
HER FOR A SPOT.
>> SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM SENT 
OUT A STATEMENT SAYING THAT 
AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY HAS DONE 
AN OUTSTANDING JOB AS UNITED 
STATES AMBASSADOR, SHOWING A 
LEVEL OF EFFECTIVENESS RARELY 
SEEN BY SOMEONE IN THIS 
POSITION, AS WE REPORTED, IT 
WAS DIGNIFIED, NIKKI HALEY WAS 
EXTREMELY GRACIOUS, AND 
FRIENDLY. 
PAULA REID, WHEN WAS THE LAST 
TIME YOU SAW PRESIDENT TRUMP 
KEEP THIS AMOUNT OF PRAISE ON 
SOMEONE? 
>> WE KEEP USING THIS TERM 
DIGNIFIED DEPARTURE, BUT THIS 
WAS GREAT FOR NIKKI HALEY, SHE 
AVOIDED BEING FIRED BY TWEET, 
HAVING INSULTS LOBBED AT HER 
DIRECTION, PUBLIC UNDERCUTTING, 
THIS GAVE HER AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
HEAP PRAISE ON THE PRESIDENT, A 
FULL THROATED DEFENSE OF THEIR 
AGENDA, SHE SAID THE U.S. IS 
RESPECTED, OTHER COUNTRIES MAY 
NOT LIKE WHAT WE DO, BUT THEY 
RESPECTED, THE U.S. IS STRONG 
AGAIN, AND WENT DOWN THE ENTIRE 
TRUMP FAMILY TREE, PRAISING 
EACH PERSON INDIVIDUALLY, 
MELANIA TRUMP, JARED KUSHNER, 
IVANKA TRUMP, SHE MENTIONED ALL 
OF THEM, THEY ARE ALL GETTING 
PRAISE AND AN ENDORSEMENT FROM 
THE OTHER, THE PRESIDENT IS 
GETTING A ENDORSEMENT FROM 
NIKKI HALEY, ONE OF THE FEW 
HIGH-PROFILE WOMEN, AND SHE 
PROMISED I WON'T RUN AGAINST 
YOU IN 2020, IN FACT I WILL BE 
ON THE CAMPAIGN STAGE RIGHT 
NEXT TO YOU. 
>> HOW DOES THAT FACTOR INTO 
FIRING UP THE BASE EVEN MORE? 
>> IT IS A GOOD QUESTION, ABOUT 
A MONTH AWAY FROM THOSE 
CRITICAL MIDTERM ELECTIONS, THE 
PRESIDENT IS COMING OFF THE 
KAVANAUGH APPOINTMENT, THEY ARE 
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO 
KEEP THE BASE STIMULATED, IF 
NIKKI HALEY WERE TO DEPART 
UNDER UNFRIENDLY TERMS, THAT 
WOULD SIGNIFY ADDITIONAL 
TURMOIL, THERE WOULD NOT BE THE 
MESSAGE THAT YOU WANT TO SEND 
JUST WEEKS BEFORE A CRITICAL 
ELECTION WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO 
MAKE THE CASE THAT REPUBLICANS 
SHOULD BE IN CHARGE OF 
GOVERNING. 
IT DOES RAISE SOME QUESTIONS 
ABOUT WHY NOW, WHY NOT WAIT A 
FEW MORE WEEKS UNTIL AFTER THE 
MIDTERMS, BUT THE WAY IN WHICH 
THEY APPROACHED THIS SIGNAL 
THAT THEY BOTH WANT TO MAKE THE 
TRANSITION AS SMOOTH AS 
POSSIBLE, AND FOR SOMEONE LIKE 
NIKKI HALEY, TALKED ABOUT THE 
IDEA THAT SHE HAS PRESUMABLY 
AMBITIONS BEYOND THIS POST, 
POTENTIALLY RUNNING FOR 
PRESIDENT AT SOME POINT, 
REMEMBER SHE IS STILL VERY 
YOUNG, TO HAVE THAT PRAISE, TO 
LEAVE UNFRIENDLY TERMS FROM 
THIS WHITE HOUSE IS A KEY 
CALLING CARD FOR WHATEVER SHE 
WANTS TO DO IN REPUBLICAN 
POLITICS, GIVEN THAT THE 
PRESIDENT IS STILL VERY POPULAR 
AMONG REPUBLICANS, AND HE IS IN 
CHARGE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY 
AT THIS POINT. 
SO LEAVING ON GOOD TERMS IS 
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR HER. 
>> SHE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE 
GRACIOUS.>> PAULA REID, KYLIE 
ATWOOD, CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS,  
LESLIE SANCHEZ, THANK YOU FOR 
JOINING US, AND BREAKING THIS 
DOWN, IF YOU'RE JUST JOINING US,
YOU AND AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY 
IS GOING TO RESIGN, AT THE END 
OF THE YEAR, AND WE JUST HEARD 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HEAPING LOADS 
OF PRAISE ON HER, SHE THINKS 
THE PRESIDENT CALLING IT IN 
HONOR OF A LIFETIME.>>> COMING 
UP, NEW INFORMATION ON 
HURRICANE MICHAEL THAT IS 
BARRELING TOWARDS FLORIDA, WE 
WILL BE RIGHT BACK.
