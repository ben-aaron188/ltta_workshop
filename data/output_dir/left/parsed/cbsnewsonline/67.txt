CLASSIFICATION AS COMMITTEE 
CLARIFIED -- PACIFIED THAT 
NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH,  THAT REFLECTS 
IN YOUR CREDIBILITY. 
IF YOU SAID I DON'T WANT TO 
HAVE CLOUD OVER THIS 
NOMINATION, I'M PREPARED TO 
úSU 
ASK TO THE COMMITTEE, PLEASE, 
WITHHOLD FURTHER HEARINGS UNTIL 
YOU DISCLOSE EVERYTHING. 
WHY WON'T YOU DO THAT? 
>> SENATOR, I DO NOT BELIEVE 
THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT 
OTHER NOMINEES HAVE DONE. 
IT IS A DECISION FOR THE SENATE 
AND THE EXECUTIE BRANCH. 
THAT WAS EXPLAINED CLEARLY. 
>> ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT 
DECISION? 
>> IS NOT FOR ME TO SAY, 
SENATOR. 
THE LONG-TERM INTERESTS OF THE 
SENATE AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH 
ARE AT PLAY. 
JUSTIN'S -- THE JUSTICE 
EXPLAINED THAT WHILE, I THOUGHT.
I WASN'T HERE FOR THAT. 
>> LET ME INTERRUPT WITHOUT 
TAKING TIME AWAY. 
DON'T CHARGE THEM FOR THIS 
TIME. 
HERE IS SOMETHING, THE NOMINEE 
DOESN'T NEED ANY HELP FOR ME TO 
ANSWER THIS. 
WE DON'T CARE WHAT THE NOMINEE 
THINKS. 
WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THE RECORDS 
ACT. 
THAT'S IT WE ARE FOLLOWING IS 
THE LAW. 
>> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, 
FOLLOWING THE RECORDS ACT 
INVOLVES THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES, 
THEY ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THIS 
PROCESS. 
IT IS MR. BILL BURKE WHO WAS A 
FORMER ASSISTANT TO THE NOMINEE 
WHO HAS DECIDED WHAT WILL BE 
WITHHELD AND WHAT IS GOING TO 
BE CONFIDENTIAL. 
SO IT ISN'T THE PRESIDENTIAL 
RECORDS ACT. 
PLEASE. 
>> STILL, LET ME MAKE CLEAR 
HERE, WE ANTICIPATE SOME OF 
THIS. 
LET ME READ THIS. 
CRITICIZE THE PROCESS FOR 
OBTAINING JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
RECORDS.  
THEY HAVE ACCUSED US OF TAKING 
THEM OUT OF THE PROCESS. 
PRESIDENT BUSH ACTED  
CONSISTENTLY WITH FEDERAL LAW 
WHEN HE EXPEDITED THE PROCESS 
AND GAVE US ACCESS IN RECORD 
TIME TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S  
RECORD. 
WE HAVE WORKED WITH ARCHIVES 
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AND THE 
DOCUMENTS THEY RECEIVED ARE THE 
SAME AS IF THEY HAD DONE THE 
INITIATIVE -- INITIAL REVIEW. 
THEY ARE NOT PERMITTED BY LAW 
TO PRODUCE RECORDS TO THE 
COMMITTEE WITHOUT GIVING BOTH 
PRESIDENT BUSH  AND A CURRENT 
PRESIDENT AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
REVIEW. 
THEY WERE NOT CUT OUT OF THE 
PROCESS. 
AS PRESIDENT BUSH'S  
REPRESENTATIVE SAID, WE HAVE 
SOUGHT, RECEIVED, AND FOLLOWED 
THE VIEWS ON ANY DOCUMENTS 
WITHHELD AS PERSONAL DOCUMENTS, 
THE RESULTING PRODUCTION OF 
DOCUMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE IS 
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS IF THEY 
HAD CONDUCTED THE REVIEW FIRST. 
AND THEN THOUGHT OUR VIEWS IN 
THE CURRENT VIEWS AS REQUIRED 
BY LAW. 
THEY RECEIVED THE SAME AS IF 
THE ARCHIVES HAD DONE THE 
INITIATIVE. 
WE ARE ABLE TO GET THEM FASTER 
BY DOING IT THIS WAY. 
THAT GAVE THE SENATE AND THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE ACCESS IN 
RECORD TIME TO A SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE WRECKER. 
CONTINUE -- RECORD. 
CONTINUE. 
>> THEY STATED THE WAY WE ARE 
HANDLING THE RECORDS ARE 
UNPRECEDENTED AND THEY HAVE 
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. 
THEY'VE ASKED TO PRODUCE 
RECORDS UNTIL THE END OF 
OCTOBER. 
THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD WE DON'T 
NEED YOU. 
WE ARE GOING TO FINISH THIS 
BEFORE THEN. 
I WOULD LIKE THIS BE PLACED IN 
RECORD RELATED TO THE RECORDS 
RELATED TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  
MAY HAVE CONSENT TO PLACES IN 
THE RECORD? 
>> I'M SORRY? 
>> THE STATEMENT FROM THE 
NATIONAL ARCHIVES? 
>> YES. 
WITHOUT OBJECTIVE. 
>> THANK YOU. 
YOU'VE SEEN THIS COMING FOR 12 
YEARS. 
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE 
2006 TEST 20 WHAT YOU GAVE. 
IT WAS AT A DIFFERENT TIME -- 
TESTIMONY THAT YOU GAVE. 
IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME. 
YESTERDAY, I ASKED YOU TO SHOW 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT HAVE 
NOTHING TO HIDE BY COMING CLEAN 
WITH US ON THIS ISSUE. AND I 
WOULD LIKE TO REFER SPECIFICALLY
TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT 
WERE RAISED BECAUSE OF THAT 
2006 TESTIMONY. 
I BELIEVE WE HAVE A STATEMENT. 
I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN THIS. 
IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT YOU 
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR A 
LONG TIME. 
WHEN I WAS BACK IN THE DAY, AN 
ATTORNEY PREPARING FOR 
DEPOSITION, GIVING TESTIMONY AT 
TRIAL, I SAID TWO THINGS, TELL 
THE TRUTH AND DON'T ANSWER MORE 
THAN YOU ARE ASKED. 
DON'T VOLUNTEER INFORMATION. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, HE FAILED ON 
THE SECOND COAT . WHAT WAS YOUR 
ROLE IN THE ORIGINAL NOMINATION?
AT THE TIME, WHAT DID YOU KNOW 
ABOUT HIS ROLE IN CRAFTING THE 
POLICY? YOUR RESPONSE, SENATOR, 
I DID NOT. 
I WAS NOT INVOLVED. 
AND I'M NOT INVOLVED IN THE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RULES 
GOVERNING DETENTION OR AND SO I 
DO NOT HAVE THE INVOLVEMENT 
WITH THAT, AND WITH RESPECT TO 
THE DOMINATION, I HAVE KNOWN 
HIM BUT IT WAS NOT ONE OF THE 
NOMINATIONS THAT I HANDLE. 
I GOT IT. 
OKAY. 
THANK YOU. 
I ASKED YOU ABOUT THIS WE HAD A 
MEETING. 
YES. 
>> I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND 
YOUR ANSWER. 
IN TERMS OF HOW YOU COULD STATE
, I WAS NOT INVOLVED AND AM NOT 
INVOLVED IN THE QUESTIONS ABOUT 
THE RULES. 
YOU WERE INVOLVED IN THE 
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT ACCESS TO 
COUNSEL FOR DETAINEES. 
YOU CONFIRMED THIS DURING THE 
MEETING WE HAD IN MY OFFICE. 
THERE ARE MULTIPLE MEDIA 
REPORTS AS WELL. 
YOU ARE INVOLVED IN DISCUSSIONS 
INVOLVING DETAINED COMBATANTS. 
YOU CONFIRMED THAT IN THE 
MEETINGS AND IN EMAILS. YOU 
WERE INVOLVED. 
THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO BE 
SPECIFIC ABOUT.  YOU WERE 
INVOLVED WITH PRESIDENT BUSH'S 
SIGNING STATEMENT  ON SENATOR 
JOHN McCAIN'S AMENDMENT BANNING 
CRUEL AND TREATMENT OF THE 
DETAINEES. 
THERE WERE NO EXCEPTIONS. 
NOT FOR LITIGATION OR 
SO IF THOSE THREE BASED ON THE 
LIMITED DOCUMENTS WHICH WE'VE 
BEEN GIVEN ARE OBVIOUS, WHAT 
WERE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME 
HERE? 
DID YOU REALLY DISCLOSE 
ACCURATELY YOUR ROLE? 
>> YES. 
I UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION THEN, 
AND MY ANSWER THEN, AND I 
UNDERSTOOD --  
>> HUMAN RIGHTS. 
WE'RE ALLOWED TO MAKE OUR OWN 
DECISIONS! 
>> I UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION 
THEN AND THE ANSWER THEN AND I 
UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION NOW AND 
THE ANSWER NOW TO BE 100% 
ACCURATE. 
YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT 
WHETHER I WAS INVOLVED IN THE 
PROGRAM, THAT TWO OTHER 
NOMINEES HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN. 
AND THE REPORT THAT SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN PRODUCED, THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT REPORT, THEY SHOW 
THAT I WASN'T, IN OTHER WORDS 
THE PROGRAM, THE CRAFTING THE 
PROGRAM FOR THE ENHANCED 
INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES FOR 
THE DETAINEES -- 
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH, THAT'S NOT 
THE QUESTION. 
DO YOU SEE ME ASKING YOU 
WHETHER YOU CRAFTED THE 
PROGRAM? 
I DIDN'T. 
I ASKED YOU ABOUT YOUR 
INVOLVEMENT IN THE HAYNES AND 
THEN YOU WENT FURTHER. 
>> CRAFTING -- 
>> AND THEN YOU WENT FURTHER. 
YOU VIOLATED THE SECOND RULE I 
GIVE TO EVERY WITNESS, YOU 
ANSWERED MORE THAN I ASK. 
>> I TOLD THE TRUTH. 
>>EL WITH, YOU VOLUNTEERED MORE 
INFORMATION THAN I ASKED AND 
YOU WENT FURTHER THAN YOU 
SHOULD HAVE BECAUSE IN THE 
THREE SPECIFIC INSTANCES I'VE 
GIVEN YOU, YOU CLEARLY WERE 
INVOLVED ABOUT RULES GOVERNING 
DETENTION OF COMBATANTS. 
>> SO I UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION 
THEN AND I UNDERSTAND IT NOW IN 
MY ANSWER ABOUT THAT PROGRAM. 
I TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT AND 
THE REPORTS THAT HAVE COME OUT 
SUBSEQUENT HAVE SHOWED I TOLD 
THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT. 
MY NAME IS NOT IN THOSE 
REPORTS. 
NOW, FOR THE 2005 SIGNING 
STATEMENTS, BY THAT TIME I'M IN 
THE STAFF SECRETARY OFFICE, AND 
EVERYTHING THAT WENT TO THE 
PRESIDENT'S DESK, EVERYTHING 
THAT WENT TO THE PRESIDENT'S 
DESK WITH A FEW COVERT 
EXCEPTIONS WOULD HAVE SOMEHOW 
CROSSED MY DESK ON THE WAY. 
SO YOU ASKED, I SAID ON A 
SIGNING STATEMENT IT WOULD HAVE 
CROSSED MY DESK ON THE WAY, SO 
WOULD A SPEECH DRAFT ON THE 
IRAQ WAR. 
SO WOULD -- YOU KNOW, THOSE 
THINGS WOULD HAVE CROSSED MY 
DESK, PREPARED BY OTHER, NOT 
PREPARED BY ME, BUT THEY 
CROSSED MY DESK ON THE WAY TO 
THE PRESIDENT. 
>> IN THE 2006 HEARING YOU TOLD 
CHAIRMANARLAN SPECTER YOU GAVE 
PRESIDENT BUSH ADVICE ON 
SIGNING STATEMENTS INCLUDING, 
QUOTE, IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL 
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES IN 
LEGISLATION. 
DID YOU MAKE ANY COMMENTS 
REGARDING THE DECEMBER 30th, 
2005 SIGNING STATEMENT ON THE 
McCAIN TORTURE AMENDMENT, 
INCLUDING POTENTIAL 
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES? 
>> I CAN'T RECALL WHAT I SAID. 
I DO RECALL THAT THERE WAS A 
GOOD DEAL OF INTERNAL DEBATE 
ABOUT THAT SIGNING STATEMENT, 
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE WOULD 
BE. 
I REMEMBER THAT IT WAS 
CONTROVERSIAL INTERNALLY, AND I 
REMEMBER THAT I THOUGHT -- AND 
I CAN'T REMEMBER ALL THE INS 
AND OUTS OF WHO THOUGHT WHAT, 
BUT I DO REMEMBER THAT THE 
COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT WAS IN 
CHARGE ULTIMATELY OF SIGNING 
STATEMENTS IN TERMS OF THE 
FINAL RECOMMENDATION TO THE 
PRESIDENT. 
>> AND JUST A FEW MONTHS LATER 
YOU UNDER OATH TOLD US YOU WERE 
NOT INVOLVED IN ANY OF THE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RULES 
GOVERNING DETENTION OF 
COMBATANTS. 
>> SENATOR, AGAIN, WE WERE -- 
AT LEAST I UNDERSTOOD IT THEN 
AND I UNDERSTAND IT NOW TO BE 
REFERRING TO THE PROGRAM WE 
WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT WAS 
VERY CONTROVERSIAL THAT SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN SPENT YEARS TRYING TO 
DIG INTO, AND I WAS -- I WAS 
NOT READ INTO THAT PROGRAM. 
I TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT THAT, 
AND -- 
>> LET ME GO TO ANOTHER AREA OF 
QUESTIONING, IF I CAN. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
IN YOUR DISSENT IN GARZA VERSUS 
HARGAN, YOU WRO ET THAT THE 
COURT HAD CREATED, QUOTE, A NEW 
RIGHT FOR UNLAWFUL IMMIGRANT 
MINORS IN THE UNITED STATES 
GOVERNMENT DETENTION TO OBTAIN 
IMMEDIATE ABORTION ON DEMAND, 
THEREBY BARRING ANY GOVERNMENT 
EFFORTS TO EXPEDITIOUSLY 
TRANSFER THE IMMIGRATION TO 
THEIR SPONSOR BEFORE THEY MADE 
THAT MOMENTUS LIFE DECISION. 
YOU ARGUED THAT PERMITTING THE 
GOVERNMENT ADDITIONAL TIME TO 
FIND A SPONSOR FOR A YOUNG 
WOMAN IN THE CASE DID NOT 
IMPOSE AN UNDUE BURDEN, EVEN 
THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT'S CONDUCT 
IN THE CASE HAD ALREADY FORCED 
HER TO DELAY HER DECISION ON AN 
ABORTION BY SEVERAL WEEKS. 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT -- 
>> HI, EVERYONE, I WANT TO 
RECAP HERE. 
I'M REENA NINAN IN NEW YORK. 
YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION 
HEARING ON CAPITOL HILL. 
WE'RE GOING TO BRING YOU BACK 
TO THIS IN JUST A MOMENT. 
WE WANT TO GIVE YOU A SENSE AND 
BRING UP TO SPEED WITH WHAT'S 
REALLY HAPPENING SO FAR WITH 
THIS HEARING. 
THIS MORNING WE KNOW KAVANAUGH 
WAS QUESTIONED ABOUT HIS VIEWS 
ON ROE V WADE. 
THAT'S OF COURSE THE 1973 
SUPREME COURT DECISION 
LEGALIZING ACCESS TO ABORTION. 
KAVANAUGH HAS STATED THAT HIS 
VIEWS ON THIS RULING, HE WOULD 
CONSIDER AS SETTLED LAW. 
AND HE EXPLAINED THIS AND HIS 
THOUGHTS ON THAT EARLIER TODAY. 
>> I SAID THAT IT'S SETTLED AS 
A PRECEDENT OF THE SUPREME 
COURT ENENTITLED THE RESPECT OF 
RESPECTS OF STARRY DECIDESUS 
AND ONE OF THE THINGS TO KEEP 
IN MIND ABOUT ROE V WADE IS 
THAT IT HAS BEEN REAFFIRMED 
MANY TIMES OVER THE PAST 45 
YEARS, AS YOU KNOW. 
AND THIS IS THE POINT I WANT TO 
MAKE THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT. 
PLANNED PARENTHOOD VERSUS CASEY 
RAFFIRMED ROE AND DID SO BY 
CONSIDERING THE STARRY 
DECIDESUS FACTORS, SO CASEY NOW 
BECOMES A PRECEDENT ON 
PRECEDENT. 
IT'S NOT AS IF IT'S JUST A RUN-
OF-THE-MILL CASE THAT WAS 
DECIDED AND NEVER BEEN 
RECONSIDERED BUT CASEY 
SPECIFICALLY RECONSIDERED IT, 
APPLIED THE STARRY DECIDESUS 
FACTORS AND DECIDED TO REAFFIRM 
IT. 
THAT MAKES CASEY A PRECEDENT ON 
PRECEDENT. 
>> AND MOLA LENGHI JOINS US NOW 
FROM CAPITOL HILL WITH MORE ON 
TODAY'S HEARINGS. 
SO YOU HEARD THAT SOUND BITE 
THIS WITH KAVANAUGH REPEATING 
THAT ROE V WADE IS SETTLED LAW. 
IS THAT ENOUGH TO PROVIDE 
COMFORT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE 
CONCERNED THAT ABORTION RIGHTS 
COULD BE OVERTURNED IN THE 
SUPREME COURT? 
>>REPORTER:  WELL, REENA, 
PROBABLY NOT JUST BECAUSE 
KAVANAUGH NEVER REALLY TOOK A 
POSITION. 
YOU KNOW, HE TALKED SORT OF IN 
GENERALITIES ABOUT PRECEDENT, 
ABOUT SETTLED LAW. 
BUT AS WE HEARD -- AND THERE 
WAS MORE TO THAT THAN THAT 
SOUND BITE, BUT REALLY SAYING 
THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER 
AGAIN AND NEVER REALLY 
ANSWERING SENATOR FEINSTEIN'S 
QUESTION AND ANSWERING EXACTLY 
WHERE HE STANDS ON THE ISSUE. 
IT WAS SENATOR FEINSTEIN WHO 
REALLY PROBED HIM ABOUT ROE V 
WADE AND KAVANAUGH'S RESPONSE, 
AGAIN, WAS IT'S SETTLED LAW IT 
IS THE PRECEDENT, IT HAS 
ALREADY BEEN DETERMINED. 
AND, YOU KNOW, EVEN WHEN HE WAS 
ASKED BY SENATOR FEINSTEIN, YOU 
KNOW, WELL, WHAT IS YOUR VIEW 
OF SETTLED LAW? 
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE 
OVERTURNED OR, YOU KNOW, CAN IT 
BE OVERTURNED OR ANYTHING LIKE 
THAT? 
AND HE DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO GO 
DOWN THAT ROAD JUST, AGAIN, 
SAYING THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 
HAS BEEN TESTED AND STOOD FOR 
DECADES, 45 YEARS, AND IT IS 
SETTLED LAW. 
BUT HE SAID ALL THAT WITHOUT 
EVER REALLY GIVING HIS POSITION 
ON ROE V WADE OR EVEN ON THE -- 
A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. 
>> YOU KNOW, MOLA, WHEN WE'RE 
WATCHING THESE HEARINGS, YOU 
ALWAYS LOOK AT THESE OFF-THE-
CUFF MOMENTS AND YESTERDAY 
THERE WAS A BIT OF CONTROVERSY 
WHEN THE FATHER OF A GIRL WHO 
WAS KILLED IN THE PARKLAND 
SHOOTING ACCUSED THE JUDGE OF 
TURNING HIS BACK ON HIM WHEN HE 
ACTUALLY TRIED TO REACH OUT AND 
SHAKE HIS HAND. 
WE'VE GOT THIS MOMENT RIGHT 
HERE WITH THE FATHER FROM 
PARKLAND. 
HOW DID KAVANAUGH RESPOND, AND 
HAS THERE BEEN ANYTHING FROM 
HIS TEAM ON THIS? 
>>REPORTER:  NOTHING PUBLICLY. 
YOU KNOW, AND SENATOR LINDSEY 
GRAHAM WHO'S ON THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE IS THE ONE SENATOR 
WHO SORT OF BROUGHT IT UP, YOU 
KNOW, IN A BROADER QUESTION, 
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM ASKING 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, YOU KNOW, SORT 
OF WHAT HE FEELS, WHAT HIS VIEW 
IS ON PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
VICTIMIZED AND THE PEOPLE WHO 
WERE LESS FORTUNATE AND NEEDY. 
AND, YOU KNOW, IN THAT 
QUESTIONING HE BROUGHT UP THE 
PARKLAND FATHER, HE BROUGHT HIM 
UP BY NAME AND SORT OF ASKED, 
YOU KNOW, WHAT IS YOUR VIEW OF 
THESE SORT OF THINGS, WHAT IS 
YOUR APPROACH, WHAT IS, YOU 
KNOW, YOUR SORT OF LIFE 
APPROACH TO THE NEEDY AND TO 
THE LESS FORTUNATE, TO THE LESS 
AMONG US. 
NOW, WHILE SENATOR GRAHAM 
REFERENCED THE PARKLAND FATHER 
BY NAME, IN KAVANAUGH'S, IN 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S RESPONSE, HE 
NEVER REALLY WENT THERE. úHE DI 
THAT IT WAS BAIT FROM SENATOR 
GRAHAM WHO IS SORT OF A 
SOFTBALL QUESTION FOR HIM, BUT 
HE NEVER WENT THERE. 
HE TALKED MORE GENERALLY ABOUT 
HIS VOLUNTEER WORK WITH THE 
HOMELESS AND THROUGH CATHOLIC 
CHARITIES AND HIS GENERAL VIEW 
THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE EQUAL 
REGARDLESS OF THEIR LOT IN LIFE 
AND THAT HE'S NO BETTER THAN A 
HOMELESS PERSON ON THE STREET, 
SO SORT OF TALKING ABOUT IT 
GENERALLY BUT NOT TALKING 
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE PARKLAND 
FATHER WHO OBVIOUSLY IS MAKING 
A LOT OF HEADLINES TODAY. 
>> AND, MOLA, IN LIGHT OF THE 
MUELLER INVESTIGATION, EVERYONE 
IS CURIOUS WHAT KAVANAUGH HAS 
TO SAY ABOUT PRESIDENTIAL 
POWERS. 
I WANT TO PLAY A BITE FOR YOU 
ABOUT THIS. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP CLAIMS HE 
HAS AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO PARDON 
HIMSELF. 
DOES HE? 
>> THE QUESTION OF SELF-PARDON 
IS SOMETHING I HAVE NEVER 
ANALYZED. 
IT'S A QUESTION THAT I'VE NOT 
WRITTEN ABOUT, IT'S A QUESTION 
THEREFORE THAT'S A HYPOTHETICAL 
QUESTION, THAT I CAN'T BEGIN TO 
ANSWER IN THIS CONTEXT AS A 
SITTING JUDGE AND AS A NOMINEE 
TO THE SUPREME COURT. 
>> DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE THE 
ABILITY TO PARDON SOMEBODY 
INFORM EXCHANGE FOR A PROMISE 
FROM THAT PERSON THEY WOULDN'T 
TESTIFY AGAINST HIM? 
>> SENATOR, I'M NOT GOING TO 
ANSWER HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS 
OF THAT SORT. 
>> DO THE DEMOCRATS HAVE 
TRACTION ON THIS ISSUE OF 
PRESIDENTIAL POWER, AND DID WE 
GET AN INSIDE INTO -- GET AN 
INSIGHT INTO KAVANAUGH'S VIEW 
ON THAT? 
>>REPORTER:  WELL, WE DIDN'T 
GET ANY INSIGHT. 
YOU KNOW, HE -- AS YOU REALLY 
HEARD HIM SAY AND THAT'S 
SOMETHING -- AGAIN, ONE OF 
THOSE RESPONSES THAT HE DIDN'T 
REALLY EXPAND ON MUCH, BUT WE 
HEARD A LOT OF THAT SORT OF 
RESPONSE AND THAT WAS THAT HE 
DIDN'T WANT TO ANSWER 
HYPOTHETICALS, THAT HE WASN'T 
GOING TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD AND 
FROM SENATOR LEAHY, AGAIN, HE 
CERTAINLY DIDN'T TAKE THE BAIT, 
SORT OF DISMISSING IT AS A 
HYPOTHETICAL AND THAT JUDGES, 
YOU KNOW, SHOULDN'T GO DOWN 
THAT ROAD. 
THIS IS THE DEMOCRATS' ISSUE. 
THIS IS THEIR BIG CONCERN ABOUT 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
YES, THEY HAVE OTHER ISSUES 
LIKE ROE V WADE AND HEALTHCARE 
AND HOW HE MAY COME DOWN ON 
THOSE ISSUES. 
BUT THEIR MAIN ISSUE, THE THING 
THAT IS PROBABLY PROMPTING THIS 
STALLING STRATEGY, THIS SORT OF 
STALLING TACTIC THAT WE'VE SEEN 
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS IS HOW 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND HOW A 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE KAVANAUGH 
MAY RULE ON PRESIDENTIAL 
PARDONS, ON ALL THINGS -- ALL 
OF THE SORT OF LEGAL ISSUES 
THAT ARE CLOUDING OVER THE 
WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW ABOUT 
WHETHER PRESIDENT TRUMP 
ULTIMATELY DECIDES TO FIRE 
SPECIAL COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER, 
WHETHER A PRESIDENT, A SITTING 
PRESIDENT CAN BE INDICTED, 
THESE ARE ALL THE ISSUES THAT 
THE DEMOCRATS ARE REALLY 
CONCERNED ABOUT, AND THEIR FEAR 
IS THAT A PRESIDENT WHO MAY 
DOWN THE ROAD BE INDICTED IS 
HAND PICKING THE SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE WHO MAY ULTIMATELY 
DECIDE THAT PRESIDENT'S FATE. 
AND SO JUDGE KAVANAUGH DIDN'T 
REALLY, YOU KNOW, TAKE A 
POSITION WHERE HE STANDS ON THE 
ISSUE. 
AND SO DEMOCRATS STILL VERY 
CONCERNED BUT ULTIMATELY, 
REENA, THERE'S REALLY NOTHING 
THEY CAN DO AT THIS POINT. 
THEY DO NOT HAVE THE VOTES TO 
BLOCK THIS APPOINTMENT. 
AND SO STALLING AND SORT OF 
SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE ISSUE IS 
REALLY ALL THEY CAN DO AT THIS 
POINT. 
>> MOLA LENGHI COMING TO US 
FROM CAPITOL HILL OUTSIDE THE 
KAVANAUGH HEARINGS. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MOLA. 
>>> WE DO WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK 
TO THE CONFIRMATION HEARING OF 
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
LET'S LISTEN IN. 
>> SO LAWN CUTTING, AND THEN 
THE CONSTRUCTION JOB THE ONE 
SUMMER. 
>> MY DIRTIEST JOB I EVER HAD 
WAS FOUR SUMMERS WORKING IN A 
SLAUGHTER HOUSE. 
>> YES. 
>> I ALWAYS WANTED TO GO BACK 
TO COLLEGE. 
COULDN'T WAIT TO GET OUT OF 
THERE. 
IT WAS UNBEARABLE. 
IT WAS DIRTY, IT WAS HOT, 
THINGS I DID UNIMAGINABLE, AND 
I WON'T EVEN START TO REPEAT 
THEM. 
THEN CAME A CASE BEFORE YOU 
CALLED AGRI PROCESSOR COMPANY 
VERSUS N.O.R.B. 
AT LEAST 1/3 OF THE WORKERS, 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, IN OUR 
NATION'S SLAUGHTER HOUSES ARE 
IMMIGRANTS. 
IT STANDS VISITS TO IOWA, 
ILLINOIS, PROBABLY DELAWARE, 
YOU PICK IT, YOU'RE GOING TO 
FIND A LOT OF IMMIGRANTS DOING 
THESE MISERABLE, DIRTY, 
STINKING HOT JOBS. 
MANY OF THEM ARE UNDOCUMENTED. 
THE WORK IS LOW PAID AND 
DANGEROUS. 
AND AS THE G.A.O.s NOTED, 
IMMIGRANTS ARE PRESSURED TO NOT 
EVEN REPORT INJURIES ON THE 
JOB. 
AGRI PROCESS' CASE WAS A 
NOTORIOUS MEAT PACKING COMPANY 
OWNED BY SHALAM RABACKEN HOSS 
WAS CONVICTEDDED OF FRAUD AND 
MONEYLANDERRING IN 2009. 
HIS 27-YEAR SENTENCE RECENTLY 
WAS COMMUTED BY PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. 
AGRI-PROCESSORS HAD AT THE CORE 
OF ITS BUSINESS MODEL THE 
EXPLOITATION OF UNDOCUMENTED 
WORKERS. 
HALF THEIR WORKERS, ALMOST 400 
OF THEM WERE NOT AUTHORIZED, 
WORKERS ALLEGE THE COMPANY 
FOSTERED A HOSTILE WORK PLACE, 
AN ENVIRONMENT THAT INCLUDED 12-
HOUR SHIFTS WITHOUT OVERTIME 
PAY, EXPOSURE TO DANGEROUS 
CHEMICALS, SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
AND CHILD LABOR. 
A TRUCK DRIVER AT AGRI 
PROCESSOR'S BROOKLYN WAREHOUSE 
TOLD REPORTERS, QUOTE, WE WERE 
TREATED LIKE GARBAGE, AND IF WE 
SAID ANYTHING, WE GOT FIRED 
IMMEDIATELY. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, YOU BENT OVER 
BACKWARDS TO TAKE THE COMPANY'S 
SIDE AGAINST THESE WORKERS. 
IN A 2008D.C. 
CIRCUIT CASE AGRI-PROCESSOR 
VERSUS N.O.R.B., YOUR DISSENT 
ARGUED THAT THIS COMPANY'S 
WORKERS SHOULD BE PROHIBITED 
FROM UNIONIZING BECAUSE THEY 
DID NOT FIT YOUR DEFINITION OF 
AN EMPLOYEE. 
TO REACH THIS CONCLUSION, YOU 
IMPORTED A DEFINITION OF 
EMPLOYEE FROM A TOTALLY 
DIFFERENT STATUTE. 
YOU IGNORED THE PLAIN LANGUAGE 
OF THE CONTROLLING STATUTE, THE 
NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT 
WHICH HAS A BROAD DEFINITION OF 
EMPLOYEE AS WELL AS BINDING 
SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT. 
THE MAJORITY IN THIS CASE, AND 
YOU WERE A DISSENTER, THE 
MAJORITY IN THIS CASE NOTED 
THAT THEIR OPINION STUCK TO THE 
TEXT OF THE NATIONAL LABOR 
RELATIONS ACT AND TO THE 1986 
IMMIGRATION REFORM AND CONTROL 
ACT WHICH DID NOT AMEND THE 
NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT. 
THEY SAID THAT YOUR DISSENT, 
THESE OTHER JUDGES SAID ABOUT 
YOUR DISSENT WOULD, QUOTE, 
ABANDON THE TEXT OF THE 
CONTROLLING STATUTE AND LEAD TO 
A, QUOTE, ABSURD RESULT. 
THE MAJORITY IN THIS DECISION 
INCLUDED ONE REPUBLICAN AND ONE 
DEMOCRATIC-APPOINTED JUDGE. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, YOU CLAIM OVER 
AND OVER AGAIN TO BE A 
TEXTUALIST, CAREFULLY WEIGHING 
EVERY WORD OF STATUTE. 
>> YES. 
>> SO WHY DID YOU GO OUT OF 
YOUR WAY TO INTERPRET THE WORD 
EMPLOYEE IN A WAY THAT 
BENEFITED THIS HORRIBLE 
BUSINESS AND DISADVANTAGED 
THESE EXPLOITED WORKERS? 
WHY DIDN'T YOU STICK TO THE 
PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE 
CONTROLLING STATUTE AND THE 
BINDING SUPREME COURT 
PRECEDENT? 
>> BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT 
PRECEDENT COMPELLED ME TO REACH 
THE RESULT THAT I REACHED, AND 
HERE'S WHY, SENATOR. 
LET ME EXPLAIN. 
THE SUPREME COURT HAD A CASE IN 
1984 CALLED THE SHIRRTAN 
DECISION. 
AND THE SHIRRTAN DECISION 
CONSIDERED THE INTERACTION OF 
THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS 
LAW ACT AND THE IMMIGRATION 
LAWS. 
AND WHAT THE SUPREME COURT DID 
IN SHIRTAN IS HAD THIS QUESTION 
AND SAID IT IS AT THAT TIME 
PERMISSIBLE TO CONSIDER AN 
IMMIGRANT UNLAWFULLY IN THE 
COUNTRY AS AN EMPLOYEE UNDER 
THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS 
ACT, AND IN PART 2B OF THE 
OPINION, YOU HAVE TO READ PART 
2B OF THE OPINION, THE SUPREME 
COURT'S OPINION. 
IF YOU READ THAT PART OF THE 
OPINION, THE COURT THEN GOES ON 
TO SAY AND BECAUSE THE 
IMMIGRATION LAWS DO NOT 
PROHIBIT EMPLOYMENT OF PEOPLE 
UNLAWFULLY IN THE COUNTRY. 
IT MAKES CLEAR -- THE SUPREME 
COURT MAKES CLEAR THIS IS WHEN 
IT'S BEING CONSIDERED IN 
CONGRESS IN '84, IT ENDS UP IN 
THE '86 ACT. 
THE COURT MAKES CLEAR AS I READ 
PART 2B AND I THINK I'M CORRECT 
ON THIS, IS THAT IF THE 
IMMIGRATION LAWS DID PROHIBIT 
EMPLOYMENT OF SOMEONE HERE 
UNLAWFULLY IN THE COUNTRY, THEN 
THAT WOULD ALSO MEAN THAT THEY 
CAN'T VOTE IN THE UNION 
ELECTION. 
SO WHAT I WAS DOING THERE, 
SENATOR, IT'S ALL ABOUT 
PRECEDENT. 
I READ THAT -- AND MY OPINION, 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DISSENTING 
OPINION, I REALLY PARSED THIS 
VERY CAREFULLY, AND I WENT DEEP 
INTO THIS CASE. 
SO I WENT BACK AND PULLED -- 
FROM THE SHIRTAN CASE, I LOOKED 
AT THE MARSHAL PAPERS FROM THE 
LIBRARY TO READ ALL THE MEMOS 
THAT WENT BACK AND FORTH IN THE 
JUSTICES IN THE SHIRTAN CASE. 
I CITED THE ORAL ARGUMENT TO 
MAKE SURE THAT WHAT I WAS 
READING IN THERE WAS ACTUALLY 
REFLECTED WHAT HAD BEEN GOING 
ON IN THE SUPREME COURT. 
AND IT IS QUITE CLEAR FROM THE 
ORAL ARGUMENT THEY WERE AWARE 
THAT THE IMMIGRATION LAW WAS 
ABOUT TO BE CHANGED AND THEY 
WERE AWARE OF THE INTERACTION 
BETWEEN THE LABOR LAW AND THE 
IMMIGRATION LAW. 
SO I THINK -- I STAND BY WHAT I 
WROTE THEN, AND I THINK I 
CORRECTLY ANALYZED PART 2B. 
NOW, SENATOR -- 
>> I HAVE TO -- WE'RE RUNNING 
OUT OF TIME HERE. 
>> IF THE SUPREME COURT SHIRTAN 
OPINION HAD ENDED AT PART 2A, 
100% WOULD AGREE WITH YOU AND 
MY DECISION WOULD HAVE BEEN 
DIFFERENT. 
>> WELL, LET ME -- 
>> IF YOU READ PART 2B -- 
>> YOU SAID EARLIER TODAY YOU 
DON'T GET TO PICK AND CHOOSE 
WHICH SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT 
YOU FOLLOW. 
THE MAJORITY IN AGRI 
PROCESSOR'S CASE WAS FOLLOWING 
SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT. 
IN THE SHIRTAN CASE, THE 
SUPREME COURT, A 7-2 DECISION 
SAID THAT UNDOCUMENTED 
IMMIGRANTS ARE EMPLOYEES UNDER 
THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS 
ACT. 
I QUOTE, SINCE UNDOCUMENTED 
ALIENS ARE NOT AMONG THE FEW 
GROUPS OF WORKERS EXPRESSLY 
EXEMPTED BY CONGRESS, THEY 
PLAINLY COME WITHIN THE BROAD 
STATUTORY DEFINITION OF 
EMPLOYEE, THAT'S A QUOTE FROM 
THE CASE. 
>> THAT'S PART 2B. 
YOU GOTTA GO TO PART 2B. 
>> LET ME HANG ON. 
LET ME TELL YOU SOME PEOPLE WHO 
WENT TO BOTHER PARTS AND 
COULDN'T DIS -- BOTH PARTS AND 
COULDN'T DISAGREE MORE. 
THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE, 
THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS 
BOARD, INCLUDING REPUBLICAN 
APPOINTEES, TWO APPEALS COURT 
JUDGES, INCLUDING ONE 
REPUBLICAN APPOINTEE FOLLOWED 
THE SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT AND 
CAME TO THE OPPOSITE CONCLUSION 
THAT YOU DID. 
I UNDERSTAND YOU MAY HAVE 
PREFERRED THE SHIRTAN DISSENT, 
BUT YOU FAILED TO FOLLOW 
SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT. 
THIS WAS A CASE WHERE THE 
NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT 
INCLUDED THOSE WHO WERE 
UNDOCUMENTED WHO COULD UNIONIZE 
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES IN THE 
WORK PLACE. 
YOU WENT OUT OF YOUR WAY TO 
DISSENT ALL THE WAY ALONG AND 
MAKE SURE THEY DIDN'T EARN IN 
YOUR VIEW NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT, 
THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE THAT 
RIGHT TO UNIONIZE. 
>> I VERY RESPECTFULLY 
DISAGREE, SENATOR. 
AND THE REASON I DISAGREE IS 
THAT THE SUPREME COURT DID SAY 
THAT THE IMMIGRANT WAS COVERED 
UNDER THE DEFINITION OF 
N.L.R.A. 
IF IT ENDS THERE, I'M WITH YOU 
100%. 
BUT THEN THE SUPREME COURT GOES 
ON TO SAY, AND WE CONSIDER ALSO 
IN RESOLVING THIS QUESTION THE 
CONFLICT BETWEEN THE NATIONAL 
LABOR RELATIONS ACT AND THE 
IMMIGRATION LAWS. 
IT MAKES CLEAR, AS I READ IT, 
IF THE IMMIGRATION LAWS HAD 
MADE EMPLOYMENT OF SOMEONE HERE 
IN THE COUNTRY UNLAWFULLY 
ILLEGAL, THEN THAT WOULD BE 
PROHIBITED IN THE CASE. 
AND I WENT BACK, LIKE I SAID -- 
IF YOU LOOK AT JUSTICE -- I 
MEAN, I QUOTE THE ORAL ARGUMENT 
TRANSCRIPT FROM SHIRTAN IN MY 
DISSENTING OPINION. 
AND, LOOK, I HAD NO -- I HAVE 
NO AGENDA IN ANY DIRECTION ON 
THE -- I'M A JUDGE. 
SO I'M JUST TRYING  TO RESOLVE 
THE PRECEDENT. 
>> LET ME JUST CLOSE -- LET ME 
CLOSE BY SAYING THIS. 
I'M JUST A JUDGE, I JUST FOLLOW 
PRECEDENT. 
GOSH, WE'VE HEARD THAT SO 
OFTEN, AND I HOPE IT'S THE 
CASE. 
BUT WE KNOW THERE'S MUCH MORE 
TO YOUR JOB THAN THAT. 
>> I AGREE. 
>> THE FACT THAT YOU WERE A 
DISSENTER AND EVERYONE ELSE SAW 
THIS THE OTHER WAY SHOULD GIVE 
US PAUSE WHEN YOU SAY I'M JUST 
FOLLOWING PRECEDENT. 
>> WELL, I RESPECTFULLY, 
SENATOR -- THAT OPINION, I'M 
PROUD OF THAT OPINION BECAUSE I 
THINK IT CAREFULLY DETAILS THE 
LAW IN THAT CASE, I'M FOLLOWING 
THE SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT. 
AND TO YOUR POINT THAT OTHER 
JUDGES DISAGREE, I'LL JUST -- 
THERE WAS A CASE I HAD ABOUT 10 
YEARS AGO OR EIGHT YEARS AGO 
CALLED PAPANYO, A CASE WHERE I 
RULED IN FAVOR OF A CRIMINAL 
DEFENDANT ON A RESTITUTION 
MATTER. 
EVERY OTHER COURT BEFOREHAND 
DISAGREED. 
I WROTE THE MAJORITY OPINION 
WITH JUDGE EDWARDS AND JUDGE 
GRIFFITH. 
EVERY OTHER COURT AFTER US 
DISAGREED. 
FINALLY WE GOT TO THE SUPREME 
COURT THIS YEAR IN THE LAGOS 
CASE AND THEY AGREED WITH OUR 
ONE OPINION, THE PAPANYO 
OPINION. 
JUST TO POINT OUT, THAT JUST 
BECAUSE OTHER COURTS OF APPEALS 
MIGHT HAVE DISAGREED DOES NOT 
NECESSARILY MEAN WE WERE 
NECESSARILY WRONG PAUSE THE 
SUPREME COURT ULTIMATELY 
DECIDES THAT. 
I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION, AND 
I APPRECIATE THEM. 
THANK YOU. 
>> SENATOR CORNYN AND SENATOR 
LEE IS GOING TO CHAIR WHILE I 
HAVE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT. 
SENATOR. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, I WAS GRATEFUL 
THAT TODAY'S HEARING AT LEAST 
AS FAR AS THE COMMITTEE IS 
CONCERNED IS A LOT MORE 
DIGNIFIED AND CIVIL, BUT 
UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THE HIGH 
JINX CONTINUE EVEN ON THE 
SENATE FLOOR. 
I KNOW SENATOR MCCONNELL HAS 
CONCEPT FOR THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE MEETING 
DURING THIS DAY'S OF THE 
SESSION. 
SENATOR SCHUMER OBJECTED, SO 
SENATOR MCCONNELL WAS LEFT WITH 
NO OPTION OTHER THAN ADJOURN 
THE SENATE AND ALLOW THE 
COMMITTEE CONTINUE TO MEET. 
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE. 
SO, JUDGE, I BELIEVE WE MET IN 
THE YEAR 2000. 
>> YES. 
>> AND JUST TO TAKE A LITTLE 
WALK DOWN MEMORY LANE HERE, 
WHEN I WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL OF 
TEXAS AND HAD A CHANCE TO ARGUE 
A CASE IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME 
COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, 
YOU, TED OLSON AND TED KRIMENT, 
I BELIEVE, HELPED ME GET READY. 
I REGRET YOU DIDN'T HAVE BETTER 
MATERIAL TO WORK WITH. 
>> IT WAS AN HONOR, SENATOR. 
>> WELL, IT WAS A GREAT 
EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATIONAL 
EXPERIENCE, BUT I GOT TO 
APPRECIATE YOUR SKILLS AS A 
LAWYER. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> FROM THAT TIME AND HAVE 
FOLLOWED YOUR CAREER CLOSELY 
SINCE, AND I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT 
YOUR NOMINATION BASED ON MY 
PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR 
SKILLS, YOUR TEMPERMENT AND 
YOUR CHARACTER AND YOUR 
FIDELITY TO THE RULE OF LAW. 
BUT I DO WANT TO PICK ONE BONE 
WITH YOU. 
I DID THIS -- THIS ISN'T UNIQUE 
TO YOU. 
BASED ON THAT EXPERIENCE, THAT 
CASE, AS YOU MAY RECALL, 
INVOLVED IS TRADITION IN THE 
SANTA FE INDEPENDENT SCHOOL 
DISTRICT UNFORTUNATELY WHICH 
úW 
IN MORE RECENT DAYS, BUT BACK 
THEN THE PRACTICE BEFORE 
FOOTBALL GAMES WAS THAT THE 
STUDENTS WOULD BE ABLE TO 
VOLUNTEER TO OFFER A PRAYER 
BEFORE THE FOOTBALL GAME. 
THEY WEREN'T REQUIRED TO DO SO. 
THE SCHOOL DIDN'T PICK THEM. 
THEY COULD OFFER AN 
INSPIRATIONAL SAYING OR READ A 
POEM OR ANYTHING ELSE. 
BUT THAT WAS THE PRACTICE. 
WELL, UNTIL THE A.C.L.U. 
FILED SUIT, AND UNFORTUNATELY 
IT WAS HELD TO BE 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, IN VIOLATION 
OF THE ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE. 
I'M NOT GOING TO ASK FOR YOUR 
OPINIONS BECAUSE THIS ISSUE 
WILL LIKELY COME BACK BEFORE 
THE COURT, BUT SINCE I 
MENTIONED IT TO JUSTICE 
GORSUCH, I'M GOING TO MENTION 
IT TO YOU. 
THE THING THAT IS STUCK IN MY 
CRAWL FOR THE LAST 18 YEARS IS 
THE DISSENT WRITTEN BY CHIEF 
JUSTICE RENQUIST WHICH TAKES 
EXCEPTION TO THE MAJORITY'S 
DECISION SAYING THEY DISTORTED 
EXISTING PRECEDENT. 
BUT HE GOES ON TO SAY EVEN MORE 
DISTURBING THAN ITS HOLDING IS 
THE TONE OF THE COURT'S 
OPINION. 
IT BRIFTLES WITH HOSTILITY TO 
ALL THINGS RELIGIOUS IN PUBLIC 
LIFE. 
NEITHER THE HOLDING NOR THE 
TONE OR THE OPINION IS FAITHFUL 
TO THE MEANING OF THE 
ESTABLISHMENT CLAWTION. 
WHEN IT IS RECALLED THAT GEORGE 
WASHINGTON'S -- THAT GEORGE 
WASHINGTON HIMSELF AT THE 
REQUEST OF THE VERY CONGRESS 
WHICH PASSED THE BILL OF RIGHTS 
PROCLAIMED A DAY OF PUBLIC 
THANKSGIVING AND PRAYER TO BE 
OBSERVED BY ACKNOWLEDGING WITH 
GRATEFUL HEARTS THE MANY AND 
SIGNALED FAVORS OF THE ALMIGHTY 
GOD. 
SINCE I HAD YOU HERE I THOUGHT 
I'D MENTION THAT. 
I'M NOT ASKING FOR YOUR OPINION 
SINCE LIKELY YOU'LL BE CALLED 
UPON TO DECIDE CASES INVOLVING 
THE ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE IN THE 
FUTURE. 
BUT SINCE WE HAD THAT HISTORY 
TOGETHER. 
>> YES. 
>> I THOUGHT I WOULD TELL YOU 
IT STILL STICKS IN MY CRAWL. 
>> I UNDERSTAND, SENATOR. 
WE REMEMBER CERTAINLY CASES I 
LOST. 
I REMEMBER. 
THEY STILL STICK IN MY CRAWL 
TOO, SENATOR. 
>> I JUST MARVEL THAT UNDER THE 
FIRST AMENDMENT WE CAN -- A 
VARIETY OF VOICES CAN SPEAK, 
AND THAT'S GENERALLY A GOOD 
THING, BUT IT CAN BE ABOUT 
VIOLENCE, SEXISM, IT CAN BE 
ABOUT ALMOST ANYTHING, BUT YOU 
CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT RELIGION IN A 
PUBLIC FORUM. 
>> WELL, THERE HAVE BEEN -- YOU 
KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN CASES 
FROM THE SUPREME COURT I THINK 
IN MORE RECENT YEARS, CASES 
LIKE THE GOOD NEWS CLUB CASE, 
CASES LIKE THE TRINITY LUTHERAN 
CASE, CASES LIKE THE TOWN OF 
GREECE CASE WHERE I THINK THE 
SUPREME COURT HAS RECOGNIZED 
THE IMPORTANCE OF COURSE OF 
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY IN THE UNITED 
STATES, AND ALSO IS RECOGNIZED 
I THINK THAT RELIGIOUS 
SPEAKERS, RELIGIOUS PEOPLE, 
RELIGIOUS SPEECH IS ENTITLED TO 
A SPACE IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE 
AND NOT TO BE DISCRIMINATED 
AGAINST. 
SO I THINK THE TRINITY LUTHERAN 
CASE IS AN IMPORTANT ONE ON 
THAT. 
THE GOOD NEWS CLUB CASE, THAT'S 
A CASE WHERE AS AN AFTER SCHOOL 
PROGRAM AT A SCHOOL, SCHOOL 
GYM, I THINK, OR AUDITORIUM AND 
A RELIGIOUS GROUP WAS EXCLUDED 
AND THE SUPREME COURT MADE 
CLEAR, NO, YOU CAN'T JUST 
EXCLUDE THE RELIGIOUS GROUP. 
SO I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN SOME 
DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THEN IN 
TERMS OF RELIGIOUS EQUALITY AND 
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY THAT ARE 
IMPORTANT. 
TOSE CASES ARE ALWAYS 
DIFFICULT FACTUALLY, BUT THE 
PRINCIPLE YOU'RE ESPOUSING I DO 
THINK IS REFLECTIVE IN SOME 
MORE RECENT SUPREME COURT 
PRECEDENT. 
>> I'LL JUST CONCLUDE WITH 
THIS. 
AS I UNDERSTAND THE 
CONSTITUTION, IT REQUIRES A 
GOVERNMENT TO BE NEUTRAL AND AS 
CHIEF JUSTICE RENQUIST I THINK 
IN THIS CASE THE GOVERNMENT 
EVIDENCED HOSTILITY TO 
RELIGIOUS SPEECH IN THE PUBLIC 
SQUARE. 
THAT'S JUST ONE PERSON'S 
OPINION, AND, AGAIN, I'M NOT 
ASKING YOU FOR ANY OPINION WITH 
REGARD TO --  
>> THAT MAY COME BEFORE THE 
COURT. 
 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, I HOPE THAT 
TIME WON'T BE SUBTRACTED FROM 
MY 30 MINUTES. 
>> IT WILL NOT BE. 
>> THANK YOU. 
SO JUDGE KAVANAUGH, I'M 
INTRIGUED BY A COMMENT THAT YOU 
MADE EARLIER ABOUT THE ROL OF 
PRECEDENT. 
WE'VE -- THE ROLE OF PRECEDENT. 
WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT 
PRECEDENT. 
YOU ALLUDED TO THIS BOOK THAT 
YOU AND OTHER JUDGES WROTE WITH 
BRIAN GARNER ON THE LAW OF 
JUDICIAL PRECEDENT. 
I CHECKED IT OUT. 
IT'S 900 PAGES LONG. 
AND I HAVEN'T READ EVERY PAGE 
OF IT EITHER. 
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S MEANT -- 
IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE READ WORD 
FOR WORD. 
IT'S A TREATISE WHERE YOU GO TO 
A SECTION THAT MIGHT BE ON 
POINT OR SOMETHING. 
>> BUT LET ME JUST ASK YOU A 
MORE BASIC QUESTION AND THEN WE 
CAN WORK OUR WAY INTO THAT. 
SHOULD -- WHEN PEOPLE GO TO 
COURT, SHOULD THEY EXPECT A 
DIFFERENT OUTCOME THAT THE 
JUDGE WAS NOMINATED BY A 
REPUBLICAN FROM A COURT WHERE 
THE JUDGE WAS NOMINATED BY A 
DEMOCRAT? 
>> NO. 
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE 
OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE AND 
THE JUDICIAL ROLE WHERE THE 
JUDGE'S UMPIRE VISION, THAT 
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS 
ARTICULATED AND I'VE TALKED 
ABOUT MANY TIMES PUBLICLY IS 
CRITICAL. 
WHEN YOU GO TO A BASEBALL GAME, 
THE UMPIRE IS NOT WEARING THE 
UNIFORM OF ONE TEAM OR ANOTHER, 
AND THAT'S A CRITICAL 
PRINCIPLE. 
>> WELL, IT STRIKES ME AS AN 
IMPORTANT POINT GIVEN THE 
SUGGESTION THAT ONE OF THE 
REASONS THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
OBJECTED TO YOUR NOMINATION IS 
I BELIEVE THE QUOTE IS YOU HAD 
REPUBLICAN BLOOD FLOWING IN 
YOUR VEINS, STRIKES ME AS A 
STRANGE AND BIZARRE STATEMENT. 
>> I'VE BEEN A JUDGE FOR 12 
YEARS, SENATOR, AND I'M 307 
OPINION, I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT 
RECORD AND BEEN AN INDEPENDENT 
JUDGE FOR 12 YEARS. 
AS A JUDGE, YOU'RE NOT A 
REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT AS A 
FEDERAL JUDGE. 
>> AND YOU TALKED ABOUT -- A 
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL BASIS FOR A 
JUDGE'S OBLIGATION TO APPLY 
COULD YOU EXPAND ON THAT A 
LITTLE BIT MORE? 
BECAUSE I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE 
UNDER THE IMPRESSION THIS IS 
SORT OF A DISCRETIONARY MATTER 
AND YOU CAN SORT OF CHERRY PICK 
BETWEEN WHAT PRECEDENTS YOU 
DECIDE TO FOLLOW AND WHICH ONES 
YOU DON'T FOLLOW. 
>> WELL, THERE'S BEEN A DEBATE 
SOMETIMES ABOUT WHAT ARE THE 
ORIGINS OF PRECEDENT, WHY DO 
YOU FOLLOW PRECEDENT, AND AS I 
SEE IT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF 
REASONS YOU WOULD CITE, 
STABILITY, PREDICTABILITY, 
IMPARTIALALITY, RELIANCE 
INTEREST, BUT ALL OF THOSE ARE 
NOT MERE POLICIES IN MY VIEW. 
AS I SEE IT, THE SYSTEM OF 
PRECEDENT COMES FROM ARTICLE 3 
ITSELF. 
WHEN ARTICLE 3 REFERS TO THE 
JUDICIAL POWER SHALL BE VESTED 
IN ONE SUPREME COURT AND SUCH 
INFERIOR COURTS AS CONGRESS 
SHALL FROM TIME TO TIME 
ESTABLISH, TO MY MIND, THE 
PHRASE JUDICIAL POWER, YOU 
THINK ABOUT WHAT DOES THAT 
ENTAIL. 
AND YOU LOOK AT THE MEANING, 
THE MEANING AT THE TIME OF 
JUDICIAL POWER AND YOU LOOK AT 
ONE SOURCE, THE FEDERALIST OF 
78. 
IN THE FEDERALIST OF 78 IT'S 
WELL EXPLAINED THAT JUDGES MAKE 
DECISIONS BASED ON PRECEDENT, 
AND PRECEDENT THEREFORE, AS I 
READ JUDICIAL POWER, HAS 
CONSTITUTIONAL ORIGINS AND A 
CONSTITUTIONAL BASIS IN THE 
TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION. 
>> AND I THINK YOU'VE TOUCHED 
ON THIS AS WELL. 
JUDGES, UNLIKE LEGISLATORS 
DON'T RUN FOR ELECTION. 
YOU DON'T HAVE A PLATFORM. 
>> NO. 
>> VOTE FOR ME, THIS IS WHAT 
I'LL DO IF ELECTED INTO OFFICE. 
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 
ELEMENTS OF THE -- OF LIMITING 
THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF JUDGES I 
THINK UNDER THE CONSTITUTION IS 
THAT YOU'RE REQUIRED TO DECIDE 
A CASE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS 
RATHER THAN ISSUING SOME SORT 
OF OR ACLE SAYING HENCEFORTH, 
THE LAW WILL BE THUS, ASEEMING 
-- ASSUMING YOU COULD GET EIGHT 
OTHER JUDGES ON THE TEAM OF 
NINE YOU TALKED ABOUT TO AGREE 
WITH YOU. 
COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE 
IMPORTANCE OF DECIDING CASES ON 
A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. 
>> WE'LL ADD ANOTHER 20 
SECONDS. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> ABSOLUTELY, SENATOR. 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND, 
AND I THINK SENATOR GRAHAM 
ALLUDED TO THIS AS WELL, AS 
JUDGES YOU DON'T JUST ISSUE 
POLICIES OR ISSUE OPINIONS OUT 
OF THE BLUE. 
YOU DECIDE AS THE ARTICLE 3 
SAYS CASES AND CONTROVERSIES, 
AND THAT MEANS THERE'S A 
PROCESS,. 
LITIGANTS COME INTO THE FEDERAL 
TRIAL COURT AND, FOR EXAMPLE, 
AND LITIGATE AGAINST ONE 
ANOTHER AND THERE'S A PROCESS 
THERE, A TRIAL OR A SUMMARY 
JUDGMENT MOTION THE DISTRICT 
JUDGE RENDERS A DECISION. 
THEN THAT COMES UP TO THE COURT 
OF APPEALS IN MY CASE AND 
THERE'S BRIEFING AND ORAL 
GUMENT. 
I LIKE TO SAY THERE'S A 
PROCESS. 
I LIKE TO SAY THE PROCESS 
PROTECTS YOU. 
THAT'S ONE OF MY THINGS I 
ALWAYS LIKE TO KEEP IN MIND. 
YOU GO THROUGH A PROCESS TO 
HELP MAKE GOOD DECISIONS, 
DELIBERATIVE PROCESS, AND WE 
HAVE A PROCESS, THE JUDGE IS 
VERY FOCUSED ON PROCESS AND 
HAVING THAT ORAL ARGUMENT, 
HAVING THE BRIEFING, AND THEN 
TALKING TO YOUR COLLEAGUES. 
YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND, YOU KNOW, 
SENATOR, YOU'VE BEEN A JUDGE OF 
COURSE, YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND 
SOMETIMES BASED ON THE COMMENTS 
OF COLLEAGUES. 
SO THAT PROCESS IS IMPORTANT. 
AND THEN TO YOUR POINT ABOUT 
YOU'RE DECIDING THAT CASE, YOU 
WRITE AN OPINION, YOU'RE NOT 
TRYING TO RESOLVE EVERY ISSUE 
IMAGINABL IN THE OPINION. 
YOU'RE TRYING TO RESOLVE THIS 
CASE UNDER THE PRINCIPLES AND 
PRECEDENCE, THE TEXT OF THE LAW 
IN QUESTION, THE TEXT OF THE 
STATUTE IN QUESTION AND DECIDE 
THAT CASE OR CONTROVERSY. 
AND THAT'S HOW JUDGES BUILD UP 
A SYSTEM OF PRECEDENT OVER TIME 
BY DECIDING ONE CASE AT A TIME 
AND NOT TRYING TO DO MORE THAN 
THEY CAN OR MORE THAN THEY 
SHOULD. 
 
>> JUDGE, DON'T YOU THINK WHAT 
YOU'VE DESCRIBED FOR US IN 
DECIDING CASES ON A CASE-BY-
CASE BASIS HAS AN IMPORTANT 
FOUNDATION IN FAIRNESS TO THE 
LITIGANT, THE PARTIES THAT COME 
TO -- LITIGANT, THE PARTIES 
THAT COME TO YOUR COURT BECAUSE 
HOW WOULD SOMEBODY FEEL IF THEY 
KNOW YOU'VE ALREADY ANNOUNCED 
IN ALL CASES THAT HAVE TO DO 
WITH SUBJECT "X" I'VE MADE UP 
MY MIND, I DON'T CARE WHAT THE 
FACTS ARE, ISN'T THAT UNFAIR TO 
THE LITIGANTS? 
>> IT CAN BE, SENATOR, AT LEAST 
WHERE AN OVERBROAD RULING MAY 
RESOLVE THINGS THAT PEOPLE WHO 
ARE AFFECTED BY IT MAY HAVE 
THOUGHT, WELL, I WASN'T PART OF 
THAT CASE. 
WHY AM I NOW AFFECTED IN A 
PARTICULAR WAY? 
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I CAN 
SAY ABOUT HOW I'VE TRIED TO 
WRITE MY OPINIONS, THE 300 
OPINIONS IS I'M ALWAYS 
CONCERNED ABOUT -- [ CROWD 
NOISE  ] >> I'M ALWAYS 
CONCERNED ABOUT UNINTENDED 
CONSEQUENCES. 
THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS I GO 
THROUGH SO MANY DRAFTS OF MY 
OPINIONS AND REALLY WORK 
THROUGH THEM IS EVEN JUST A 
SLOPPY FOOTNOTE OR AN AMBIGUOUS 
WORD IN AN OPINION, IT'S TRUE 
WHEN YOU'RE DRAFTING LAWS HERE 
TOO, BUT --  
>> IF YOU DON'T -- YOU'RE 
CONCERNED ABOUT UNINTENDED 
CONSEQUENCES WHICH IS WHY IT'S 
SO IMPORTANT TO BE CLEAR IN THE 
OPINIONS AND TO BE EXACTLY 
PRECISE AND NOT TO DECIDE TOO 
MUCH. 
 
>> YOUR BODIES OUR CHOICE! 
>> JUDGE, LET ME ASK YOU TO 
TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 
SEPTEMBER THE 11th, 2001. 
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU HEARD 
THAT THE PLANES HIT THE WORLD 
TRADE CENTER AND WASHINGTON 
D.C. AND ANOTHER PLANE HIT THE 
PENTAGON HERE IN WASHINGTON? 
>> I REMEMBER -- 
>> YOU WERE HERE IN WASHINGTON. 
>> I WAS IN THE WEST WING WHEN 
IT HIT THE SECOND TOWER. 
I REMEMBER THAT UP IN THE 
UPSTAIRS COUNSEL'S OFFICE WITH 
A COUPLE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE 
COUNSEL'S OFFICE. 
AND THEN WE WERE USHERED 
DOWNSTAIRS, AND THEN TOLD TO 
GET OUT, RUN OUT BECAUSE THERE 
WAS FEAR, AS WE LATER LEARNED 
ABOUT FLIGHT 93. 
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS 
HEADED TO THE CAPITOL OR THE 
WHITE HOUSE OR SOME OTHER 
TARGET OF COURSE. 
AND THE HEROS OF FLIGHT 93 
SAVED SO MANY AMERICANS, 
SACRIFICED -- A SACRIFICE THAT, 
OF COURSE, WE ALL STILL 
CELEBRATE IN THE SENSE OF 
CELEBRATING THEIR LIVES AND 
THEIR HEROISM FOR SAVING ALL OF 
US HERE IN WASHINGTON, BUT 
ENDED UP OUT IN LAFAYETTE PARK 
WITH THE REST OF THE STAFF AND 
BEWILDERED AND CHANGED AMERICA, 
AND CHANGED THE WORLD, CHANGED 
THE PRESIDENCY, CHANGED 
CONGRESS, CHANGED THE COURTS, 
ALL THE ISSUES THAT CAME BEFORE 
US. 
THERE WAS A NEW KIND OF WAR AS 
PRESIDENT BUSH DESCRIBED WITH 
AN ENEMY THAT DIDN'T WEAR 
UNIFORMS AND THAT WOULD ATTACK 
CIVILIANS, AND SO NEW KINDS OF 
LAWS HAD TO BE CONSIDERED AND 
CONGRESS HAD TO WORK THROUGH 
THAT AND PRESIDENT BUSH HAD TO 
FOCUS SO INTENTLY, AND AS I'VE 
SAID BEFORE, MY REMEMBRANCE IS 
THAT ON SEPTEMBER 12th, HIS 
BASIC MENTALITY WAS THIS WILL 
NOT HAPPEN AGAIN, AND HAVING 
TRAVELED WITH HIM FROM 2003 TO 
2006 EVERYWHERE AS STAFF 
SECRETARY AND SEEING HIM UP 
CLOSE, I STILL THINK EVERYDAY I 
WAS WITH HIM DURING THOSE 
YEARS, EVERY MORNING WHEN HE 
GOT UP, IT WAS STILL SEPTEMBER 
12th, 2001, THIS WILL NOT 
HAPPEN AGAIN. 
AND TO SEE THAT FOCUS -- OF 
COURSE HE HAD TO DO ALL THE 
OTHER THINGS OF THE PRESIDENCY 
AND ALL THE OTHER LEGISLATIVE 
AND REGULATORY AND CEREMONIAL 
ASPECTS, BUT HE WAS SO FOCUSED 
ON THAT, AND I'M SURE THAT'S 
BEEN TRUE OF THE SUCCEEDING 
PRESIDENTS AS WELL BECAUSE THE 
THREAT -- THE THREAT STILL 
EXISTS OF COURSE. 
>> WELL, AS WE CAME TO LEARN, 
OSAMA BIN LADEN AND AL-QAIDA 
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT ATTACK 
AND HAS NOW MORPHED INTO OTHER 
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE ISIS AND THE 
LIKE. 
BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU, YOU HAD 
TO THEN SIT IN JUDGMENT LATER 
ON IN A CASE, THE HAMDONG CASE 
WHICH YOU ALLUDED TO EARLIER 
WHERE THE DEFENDANT WAS OSAMA 
BIN LADEN'S PERSONAL BODYGUARD 
AND DRIVER. 
HE WAS CAPTURED BY U.S. FORCES 
IN AFGHANISTAN AFTER 9/11 AND 
DETAINED IN GUANTANAMO BAY. 
HE SUBSEQUENTLY WENT THROUGH A 
MILITARY TRIBUNAL, AND THEN 
THAT CASE WAS APPEALED TO YOUR 
COURT. 
AND JUST CORRECT ME IF I'M 
WRONG, BUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE 
EXPERIENCE YOU AND EVERYBODY 
YOU CARED ABOUT HAVING BEEN 
THROUGH THIS TERRIBLE TRAFFESTY 
OF 9/11, YOU RULED IN FAVOR OF 
OSAMA BIN LADEN'S BODYGUARD AND 
DRIVER, CORRECT? 
>> THAT IS CORRECT. 
I WROTE THE MAJORITY OPINION. 
>> HOW COULD YOU DO THAT? 
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY DO THAT? 
>> THE RULE OF LAW APPLIES TO 
ALL WHO COME BEFORE THE COURTS 
IN THE UNITED STATES. 
>> EVEN AN ENEMY COMBATANT? 
>> EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. 
EVERYONE IS ENTITLED TO -- 
>> EVEN A NON-CITIZEN? 
>> YES. 
NON-CITIZENS WHO ARE TRIED IN 
U.S. COURTS OF COURSE HAVE THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. 
AND REALLY MY MODEL ON THAT, 
JUDICIAL MODEL FOR THINKING 
ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT 
BECAUSE I THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT 
YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT, JUSTICE 
JACKSON, OF COURSE, ROBERT 
JACKSON HAD BEEN FRANKLIN 
ROOSEVELT'S ATTORNEY GENERAL IN 
THE CORMATZU CASE EVEN THOUGH 
THAT WAS ONE OF PRESIDENT 
ROOSEVELT'S POLICIES, JACKSON 
THE MAJORITY OPINION NOW 
OVERRULED BUT JUSTICE JACKSON 
DISSENTED AND RULED AGAINST THE 
ROOSEVELT POLICY. 
JUSTICES CLARK AND BURTON, TWO 
APPOINTEES OF PRESIDENT TRUMAN 
ARE THE TWO DECIDING VOTES IN 
YOUNGSTOWN STEEL. 
THAT'S A 6-3 DECISION. 
THOSE TWO ARE THE DECIDING 
VOTES THEREFOR. 
THEY BOTH WERE APPOINTEES OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMAN, IT'S WARTIME 
AGAINST KOREA. 
THEY GET TO THE SUPREME COURT, 
THEY'RE THE DECIDING VOTES IN 
THE YOUNGSTOWN STEEL CASE WHICH 
WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY NATIONAL 
MOMENT, ONE OF THE GREAT 
MOMENTS, AND SO YOUR CONCEPTION 
OF THE ROLE OF A JUDGE IS IT'S 
ABOUT THE LAW, THAT'S DISTINCT 
FROM POLICY AND OUR JUDICIARY 
DEPENDS ON HAVING PEOPLE IN IT 
AND WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE A 
WONDERFUL FEDERAL JUDICIARY, 
PEOPLE IN IT WHO UNDERSTAND THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LAW AND 
POLICY AND ARE WILLING TO APPLY 
PRINCIPLES OF EQUAL JUSTICE 
UNDER LAW TO ANYONE WHO COMES 
BEFORE THE COURT, EVEN THE MOST 
UNPOPULAR POSSIBLE DEFENDANT IS 
STILL ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS 
AND THE RULE OF LAW. 
AND I'VE TRIED TO ENSURE THAT 
AS A JUDGE. 
>> WELL, IT'S HARD FOR ME TO 
IMAGINE A MORE UNPOPULAR 
DEFENDANT THAN OSAMA BIN 
LADEN'S DRIVER AND PERSONAL 
BODYGUARD. 
SO I FIND THE SUGGESTION THAT 
SOMEHOW YOU ARE PREJUDICED 
AGAINST THE SMALL GUY IN FAVOR 
OF THE BIG GUY OR THAT YOU ARE 
PICKING AND CHOOSING WHO YOU'RE 
GOING TO RERND JUDGMENT IN 
FAVOR OF BASED -- RENDER 
JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF BASED ON 
THE RULE OF LAW, I THINK THAT 
ANSWERS THAT QUESTION 
CONCLUSIVELY FOR ME, THE FACT 
THAT YOU COULD SEPARATE 
YOURSELF FROM THE EMOTIONAL 
INVOLVEMENT YOU HAD ALONG WITH 
SO MANY PEOPLE YOU WORKED 
CLOSELY WITH IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
ON SEPTEMBER THE 11th, AND YOU 
COULD THEN AS A JUDGE, AFTER 
YOU PUT ON THE BLACK ROBE AND 
TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE, YOU 
COULD THEN RENDER A JUDGMENT IN 
FAVOR OF OSAMA BIN LADEN'S 
BODYGUARD AND DRIVER BECAUSE 
YOU APPLIED THE LAW EQUALLY TO 
EVERYBODY THAT COMES TO YOUR 
COURT. 
SOMETIMES THE -- LET ME ALLUDE 
TO SOMETHING SENATOR SASSE I 
THINK WAS ELOQUENTLY SPEAKING 
ABOUT YESTERDAY IN TERMS OF THE 
SEPARATION OF POWERS, VERY 
IMPORTANT ASPECT OF OUR 
CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM AND ONE 
THAT I KNOW YOU'VE DEALT WITH 
OFTEN ON THE D.C. CIRCUIT COURT 
OF APPEALS, AND THAT HAS TO DO 
WITH WHAT I'VE READ SOME JUDGES 
TALK ABOUT, SOME CONSTITUTIONAL 
SCHOLARS TALK ABOUT A 
CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE 
BRANCHES, IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN 
THE D.C. CIRCUIT COURT OR THE 
SUPREME COURT DECIDES A CASE, 
THEY FINALLY DECIDE THAT CASE, 
BUT THEY DON'T FINALLY DECIDE 
WHAT THE POLICY IS -- 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
>> FOR THE UNITED STATES OR THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE, CORRECT? 
>> THAT'S CORRECT, SENATOR. 
AND I THINK ONE OF THE 
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT JUDGES 
CAN DO IS ADHERE OF COURSE TO 
THE LAWS PASSED BY CONGRESS, 
BUT THEN IN WRITING THE OPINION 
MAKE CLEAR, AND I'VE DONE THIS 
BEFORE AND A LOT OF MY 
COLLEAGUES DO THIS IS THAT 
PERHAPS THE STATUTE NEEDS 
UPDATING, BUT IF IT DOES, THAT 
IS THE ROLE OF CONGRESS TO 
UPDATE THE STATUTE, OR IF 
THERE'S -- SOMETIMES THERE'LL 
BE A HOLE IN A STATUTE OR 
SOMETHING THAT SEEMS UNINTENDED 
IN A STATUTE AND TO ALERT 
CONGRESS TO THAT. 
CHIEF JUDGE KATZMAN OF THE 2nd 
CIRCUIT WHO'S A GREAT JUDGE I 
SERVED WITH ON THE JUDICIAL 
BRANCH COMMITTEE WHO IS 
APPOINTED BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE 
AND HE HAS WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT 
STATUTORY INTERPRETATION, BUT 
HE'S ALSO BEEN THE LEADER OF A 
PROJECT TO MAKE SURE THAT 
CONGRESS IS ALERTED OF 
POTENTIAL STATUTORY ISSUES THAT 
LOOK LIKE THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
THINGS THAT PERHAPS CONGRESS 
WOULD NOT HAVE INTENDED OR AT 
LEAST CONGRESS WOULD WANT 
BROUGHT TO ITS ATTENTION SO IT 
COULD FIX AND -- [ CROWD NOISE  
] 
>> AND SO THAT PROJECT HAS BEEN 
VERY SUCCESSFUL. 
I THINK CHIEF JUDGE KATZMAN'S 
PROJECT, AND IT'S ONE EVEN 
WITHOUT THAT PROJECT HOW YOU 
WRITE YOUR OPINIONS I THINK IS 
IMPORTANT. 
WE DON'T UPDATE THE STATUTES, 
YOU UPDATE THE STATUTES. 
BUT IT'S GOOD FOR US TO WRITE 
OUR OPINIONS IN A WAY THAT 
POINTS OUT POTENTIAL ISSUES 
THAT CONGRESS MIGHT WANT TO BE 
AWARE OF. 
>> AND THAT'S PART OF THE 
CONVERSATION BETWEEN -- 
>> YES. 
>> THE TWO CO-EQUAL BRANCHES OF 
GOVERNMENT. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT 
DIALOGUE TO HAVE BETWEEN 
CONGRESS AND THE JUDICIARY AND 
THE BACK AND FORTH IS VERY 
IMPORTANT ON THAT FRONT, AND I 
THINK THAT'S ONE THING I'M 
ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT IN MY 
OPINIONS. 
YOU WRITE THE LAW, BUT IF THE 
LAW LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOME 
ISSUE WITH IT, SOME FLAW OR 
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE AN 
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE IN THE 
OPINION, YOU CAN IDENTIFY IT, 
AND THAT CAN BE SOMETHING THAT 
CONGRESS CAN TURN ITS ATTENTION 
TO SOMETIMES BECAUSE I'M WELL 
AWARE THAT STATUTORY DRAFTING 
IS A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS. 
THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK JUDGES 
NEED TO BE ACTUALLY MORE AWARE 
OF IS HOW DIFFICULT THE 
LEGISLATIVE DRAFTING PROCESS 
IS, EVEN IF YOU'RE DOING IT AS 
ONE PERSON IT WOULD BE 
DIFFICULT, BUT THEN YOU'RE 
DOING IT AS A COLLECTIVE BODY 
AND THEN YOU'RE DOING IT WITH 
THE HOUSE AND WITH THE 
PRESIDENT INVOLVED. 
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN IT 
AND IT'S HARD TO HAVE -- WITH 
ALL THE COMPROMISES INHERENT IN 
THAT, HARD TO HAVE A CRYSTAL 
CLARITY ON EVERY POSSIBLE 
TOPIC. 
SO AS JUDGES, I THINK, NUMBER 
ONE, WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE 
PROCESS THAT YOU GO THROUGH AS 
LEGISLATORS, THAT MEANS ADHERE 
TO THE COMPROMISES THAT ARE 
MADE, THE TEXT AS WRITTEN, BUT 
ALSO WHEN WE WRITE OUR OPINIONS 
IF THERE SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING 
THAT'S NOT WORKING OUT, IT'S 
NOT -- IT'S APPROPRIATE I THINK 
FOR JUDGES TO POINT THAT OUT IN 
THEIR OPINIONS. 
>> AND OF COURSE EVEN IF IT'S 
CONSTITUTIONAL BASIS FOR YOUR 
DECISION, THAT COULD BE CHANGED 
BY CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, 
CORRECT? 
>> WELL, THAT'S CORRECT AS 
WELL. 
THE FRAMERS DID NOT THINK THE 
CONSTITUTION WAS PERFECT BY ANY 
STRETCH. 
THEY KNEW IT HAD IMPERFECTIONS 
FOR STARTERS, THE ORIGINAL 
CONSTITUTION DID NOT HAVE THE 
BILL OF RIGHTS, THE FIRST 10 
AMENDMENT, SO THERE WAS A LOT 
OF DISCUSSION AT THE RATIFYING 
CONVENTIONS ABOUT HAVING A BILL 
OF RIGHTS, AND THAT WAS QUICKLY 
DONE IN THE FIRST CONGRESS IN 
NEW YORK IN 1789 OF COURSE BY 
JAMES MADISON TAKING THE LEAD 
ON THAT. 
BUT SO TOO THEY DID NOT THINK 
IT WAS PERFECT. 
THEY HAD AN AMENDMENT PROCESS 
THAT SPECIFIED IN ARTICLE 5 OF 
THE CONSTITUTION, AND THAT 
AMENDMENT PROCESS WAS INTENDED 
TO BE USED. 
AND WE'VE SEEN IT USED TO 
CORRECT STRUCTURAL ISSUES, THE 
12th EAMENTZ ON PRESIDENTIAL 
ELECTION, THE 17th AMENDMENT, 
OF COURSE, AS YOU ALL KNOW WELL 
ON SENATE ELECTIONS, THE 22nd 
AMENDMENT WHICH LIMITED 
PRESIDENTS TO ONLY TWO TERMS, 
THE 25th AMENDMENT WHICH 
CORRECTED SOME ISSUES WITH 
RESPECT TO VICE PRESIDENCY, AND 
SO TOO OF COURSE THE 13th, 14th 
AND 15th AMENDMENTS, THE MOST 
IMPORTANT AMENDMENTS IN THE 
CONSTITUTION IN MANY RESPECTS 
BECAUSE IT BROUGHT THE PROMISE 
OF RACIAL EQUALITY THAT HAD 
BEEN DENIED AT THE TIME OF THE 
ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION INTO THE 
TEXT OF THE CONSTITUTION. 
SO THE JOB OF THE PEOPLE WHICH 
IS THE CONGRESS AND THE STATE 
LEGISLATURES IS TO AMEND THE 
CONSTITUTION. 
IT'S NOT THE JOB OF JUDGES TO 
DO THAT ON OUR OWN AND 
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A BASIC DIVIDE 
OF CONSTITUTIONAL 
RESPONSIBILITY THAT IS SET 
FORTH RIGHT IN THE TEXT OF 
ARTICLE 5 OF THE CONSTITUTION. 
>> I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO SAID 
IT. 
I THINK JUSTICE JACKSON PERHAPS 
WHO SAID THE SUPREME COURT IS 
ALWAYS RIGHT, IT'S NOT FINAL 
BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS RIGHT, IT'S 
RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S FINAL OR 
WORDS TO THAT EFFECT. 
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT THE MORE I 
GOT INTO THAT, THE MORE I 
DISAGREED WITH THAT BECAUSE IT 
IS A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE 
BRANCHES, AND IF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IT IS A 
CONSTITUTIONAL MATTER, THE WAY 
THE CONSTITUTION IS BEING 
INTERPRETED, IT'S WITHIN OUR 
POWER AS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO 
CHANGE OUR OWN CONSTITUTION BY 
AMENDMENT. 
THERE'S PROVISIONS IN THE 
CONSTITUTION ITSELF TO DO THAT. 
IT'S HARD AND IT SHOULD BE 
HARD, BUT ULTIMATELY THE 
AUTHORITY THAT WE DELEGATE TO 
THE GOVERNMENT FINDS ITS ORIGIN 
IN THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED. 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING DICTATED TO 
US FROM DOWN ON HIGH FROM THE 
MARBLE PALACE OR SOMEWHERE LIKE 
THAT HERE IN WASHINGTON. 
IT IS ULTIMATELY OUR 
GOVERNMENT, OUR RESPONSIBILITY, 
OUR AUTHORITY THAT PROVIDES 
LEGITIMACY TO THE GOVERNMENT 
ITSELF. 
YOU AGREE WITH THAT? 
>> I AGREE. 
OF COURSE WITH THAT, SENATOR, 
THE PEOPLE -- WE THE PEOPLE 
FORM THE CONSTITUTION OF THE 
UNITED STATES AND THE 
SOVEREIGNTY THAT THE PEOPLE ARE 
THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY. 
AND YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT JUSTICE 
JACKSON'S LINE. 
IK IT IS A CLEVER LINE, -- I 
THINK IT IS A CLEVER LINE, BUT 
ULTIMATELY I AGREE WITH YOU. 
I'VE ALWAYS HAD A LITTLE BIT OF 
A PROBLEM WITH THAT LINE 
BECAUSE WE'RE INFALLIBLE 
BECAUSE WE'RE FINAL. 
NO, BOTH PARTS OF THAT ARE 
WRONG IN SOME SENSE BECAUSE I 
NEVER WANT TO THINK OF THE 
COURT AS INFALLIBLE, AND I ALSO 
NEVER WANT TO THINK OF IT 
NECESSARILY, YOU KNOW, IN THE 
WAY YOU'RE DESCRIBING EITHER 
BECAUSE THERE IS THE PEOPLE 
ALWAYS HAVE AN ABILITY TO 
CORRECT THROUGH THE AMENDMENT 
PROCESS. 
NOW, THE AMENDMENT PROCESS IS 
HARD AND HASN'T BEEN USED AS 
MUCH IN RECENT DECADES. 
BUT OF COURSE AT THE BEGINNING 
OF THE COUNTRY, THE AMENDMENTS 
WERE CRITICAL AND DREAD SCOTT, 
OF COURSE, THE AWFUL EXAMPLE OF 
JUST A HORRIFIC SUPREME COURT 
DECISION THAT IS THEN CORRECTED 
IN PART, AT LEAST ON PAPER IN 
THE 14th AMENDMENT, 13th, 14th 
AMENDMENTS, AND THAT'S AN 
IMPORTANT EXAMPLE I THINK OF 
YOUR -- PROBABLY THE BEST 
EXAMPLE, FRANKLY, OF THE POINT 
YOU'RE MAKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE 
BEING ABLE TO RESPOND TO 
HORRIFIC DECISION OF THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
>> WELL, IN FAIRNESS TO JUSTICE 
JACKSON, MAYBE HE WAS THINKING 
AS I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT ABOUT 
THE EXPRESSION AS BEING BINDING 
ON LOWER COURT JUDGES, TRIAL 
JUDGES, APPELLATE COURT JUDGES 
AND THE SUPREME COURT DOES HAVE 
THE FINAL WORD IN THAT FOOD 
CHAIN OF THE JUDICIARY BUT NOT 
IN TERMS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL 
AUTHORITY OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE TO DECIDE WHAT LAWS 
SHOULD GOVERN THEM. 
>> I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY 
RIGHT, SENATOR. 
I DON'T WANT TO BE JUSTICE -- 
JUSTICE JACKSON IS ONE OF OUR 
GREATEST JUSTICES. 
TO QUESTION ANYTHING, WHETHER 
IT'S COROMATZU, OR YOUNGSTOWN 
JUSTICE JACKSON WROTE SOME OF 
THE GREATEST OPINIONS AND THE 
EXAMPLE OF JUDICIAL 
INDEPENDENCE AS WELL, BUT ON 
THAT ONE LINE, I TAKE YOUR 
POINT. 
>> LET ME JUST ASK YOU ONE LAST 
QUESTION. 
WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE 
ROLE OF PRECEDENT AND SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN TALKED ABOUT STARRY 
DECIDESUS AND BASICALLY CASES 
THAT HAVE BEEN DECIDED PROVIDE 
THE PRECEDENT FOR FUTURE CASES. 
BUT ON OCCASION THE SUPREME 
COURT HAS DECIDED THAT ITS 
DECISIONS WERE JUST WRONG AND 
CHOSEN TO OVERRULE THOSE 
PREVIOUS DECISIONS. 
I'M THINKING OF PLESSY VERSUS 
FERGUSON, FOR EXAMPLE, WHICH 
WAS A SCAR ON OUR BODY POL 
PARTICULAR THAT SAID SEPARATE 
BUT EQUAL EDUCATIONAL 
FACILITIES MET THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT OF 
THE 14th AMENDMENT. 
BUT CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE 
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES 
UNDER WHICH THE SUPREME COURT 
WOULD REVISIT A PRECEDENT? 
>> WELL, BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF 
EDUCATION OF COURSE OVERTURNED 
PLESSI, AND PLESSI WAS WRONG 
THE DAY IT WAS DECIDED. 
IT WAS INCONSISTENT WITH TEXT 
AND MEANING OF THE 14th 
AMENDMENT WHICH GUARANTEED 
EQUAL PROTECTION, AND THE 
SUPREME COURT IN THE SHROUDER 
VERSUS WEST VIRGINIA CASE IN 
1880, JURY SELECTION CASE HAD 
SAID WHAT IS THIS AMENDMENT BUT 
THAT THE LAW SHALL BE THE SAME 
FOR THE BLACK AND THE WHITE, 
AND THE SUPREME COURT 
UNFORTUNATELY BACKTRACKED FROM 
THAT CLEAR PRINCIPLE IN THE PZ 
LESSI DECISION -- IN THE PLESSI 
DECISION AND A HORRIFIC 
DECISION WHICH ALLOWED SEPARATE 
BUT EQUAL, AND THEN BROWN 
VERSUS BOARD CORRECTED THAT IN 
1954, OF COURSE CORRECTED IT ON 
PAPER, STILL DECADES, AND WE'RE 
STILL SEEKING TO ACHIEVE RACIAL 
EQUALITY, THE LONG MARCH FOR 
RACIAL EQUALITY IS NOT OVER. 
BUT BROWN VERSUS BOARD, AS I'VE 
SAID PUBLICLY MANY TIMES 
BEFORE, THE SINGLE GREATEST 
MOMENT IN SUPREME COURT HISTORY 
BY -- IN SO MANY WAYS. 
THE UNIMEN AND WOMENNITY, THE 
CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN ACHIEVED 
WHICH IS JUST A GREAT MOMENT, 
THE FACT THAT IT LIVED UP TO 
THE TEXT OF THE EQUAL 
PROTECTION CLAUSE, THE FACT 
THAT IT UNDERSTOOD THE REAL-
WORLD CONSEQUENCES OF THE 
SEGREGATION ON THE AFRICAN-
AMERICAN STUDENTS WHO WERE 
SEGREGATED INTO OTHER SCHOOLS 
AND STAMPED WITH A BADGE OF 
INFERIORITY, THAT MOMENT IN 
BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF EDUCATION 
IS SO CRITICAL TO REMEMBER AND 
THE OPINION IS SO 
INSPIRATIONAL. 
I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE -- IT'S A 
RELATIVE SHORT OPINION, BUT 
IT'S VERY POWERFUL, IT'S VERY 
FOCUSED ON THE TEXT OF THE 
EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE AND 
CORRECTING -- IN CORRECTING 
THAT AWFUL PRECEDENT OF PLESSI 
VERSUS FERGUSON, A GREAT 
EXAMPLE OF LEADERSHIP. 
AND THE LAST POINT I'LL MENTION 
ON PROCESS, THEY KNEW THEY WERE 
GOING TO FACE POPULAR BACKLASH. 
THEY KNEW IT, BUT THEY STILL 
DID IT, SO THAT SHOWS 
INDEPENDENCE AND FORTITUDE, BUT 
THEY ALSO HAD REARGUMENT WHICH 
I THINK IS A GOOD -- THEY HAD 
ARGUMENT ORIGINALLY AND THEN 
DECIDED THERE'S A LOT GOING ON 
AND MAYBE NOT EVERYONE IS 
SEEING IT THE SAME WAY, THE 
JUSTICES AND THEY HAD A 
REARGUMENT WHICH I THINK IS A 
GOOD LESSON ON PROCESS 
PROTECTING US AND KEEP WORKING 
AT IT AND KEEP WORKING AT IT 
AND SEE, YOU KNOW, THE 250E78 
OF NINE I MENTIONED -- THE TEAM 
OF NINE I MENTIONED YESTERDAY 
AND MENTIONED TODAY, KEEP 
WORKING ON IT AS A TEAM OF NINE 
AND THEY CAME OUT UNANIMOUS. 
THAT WAS THE GREATEST MOMENT IN 
THE SUPREME COURT HISTORY. 
>> THANK YOU, JUDGE. 
>> THANK YOU. 
I AWARDED TWO ADDITIONAL 
MINUTES TO SENATOR CORNYN 
BECAUSE HE WAS INTRUMENTED FIVE 
TIMES DURING HIS TESTIMONY. 
SENATOR WHITEHOUSE IS NEXT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
GOOD AFTERNOON, JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH. 
>> SENATOR. 
>> ARE YOU GOOD FOR ANOTHER 
HALF HOUR? 
>> I'M GOOD. 
>> ALL RIGHT, GOOD. 
IN MY OFFICE, YOU TOLD ME THAT 
YOU COULD PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE 
TO ME THAT YOU'D UPHOLD A 
STATUTE REQUIRING INSURANCE 
COMPANIES TO PROVIDE COVERAGE 
FOR PRE-EXISTING MEDICAL 
CONDITIONS. 
IS THAT STILL TRUE HERE IN 
PUBLIC? 
SENATOR, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT 
TO UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLE IN 
PLAY HERE. 
>> WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT 
THAT. 
BUT THE STATEMENT I'VE MADE -- 
HAVE I RECITED IT ACCURATE AND 
IS IT STILL TRUE TODAY THAT YOU 
WOULD GIVE NO ASSURANCE THAT 
YOU'D UPHOLD -- 
>> JUDGES LIKE TO EXPLAIN. 
>> UCIAL YOU GET TO ASK THE 
QUESTIONS BECAUSE YOU'RE THE 
APPELLATE JUDGE, BUT TODAY FOR 
HALF HOUR I GET TO. 
SO IS IT STILL TRUE THAT YOU 
CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCE THAT YOU 
WOULD UPHOLD A STATUTE 
REQUIRING INSURANCE COMPANIES 
TO COVER PRE-EXISTING MEDICAL 
CONDITIONS? 
>> SO TO PREPARE FOR THIS 
MOMENT, I WENT BACK AND READ -- 
>> I REALLY WOULD LIKE YOU TO 
BE AS CAREFUL WITH YOUR TIME AS 
YOU CAN BECAUSE I HAVE A VERY 
LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME WITH 
YOU. 
SO THE QUICKER YOU CAN GET TO 
THE ANSWER, IT COULD BE AS 
SIMPLE AS YES OR NO. 
>> BUT I CAN ENHANCE YOUR 
UNDERSTANDING OF MY ANSWER IF I 
EXPLAIN IT, I THINK. 
>> I REALLY JUST WANT YOUR 
ANSWER ON THE RECORD. 
I THINK I'M PRETTY CAPABLE OF 
UNDERSTANDING IT ON MY OWN. 
>> I WANT EVERYONE TO 
UNDERSTAND MY ANSWER. 
SO THERE'S NOMINEE PRECEDENT OF 
HOW JUSTICES AND NOMINEES IN MY 
POSITION HAVE ANSWERED IN THE 
PAST. 
I'LL BE SUCCINCT IF I CAN, AND 
ALL EIGHT SITTING JUSTICES -- 
>> I KNOW. 
YOU ACTUALLY SAID THIS IN THE 
HEARING SO PEOPLE WHO ARE 
LISTENING AND INTERESTED HAVE 
ACTUALLY ALREADY HEARD YOU SAY 
THIS. 
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S REALLY 
IMPORTANT SO -- 
>> SAY IT AGAIN. 
>> I WANT TO UNDERSCORE IT. 
ALL EIGHT SITS JUSTICES OF THE 
SUPREME COURT HAVE MADE CLEAR 
THAT IT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT 
WITH JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE 
ROOTED IN OUR ARTICLE 3 TO 
PROVIDE ANSWERS ON CASES OR 
ISSUES THAT COULD COME BEFORE 
US. 
JUSTICE GINSBURG NO HINTS 
FORECAST, JUSTICE KAGAN TALKING 
ABOUT PRECEDENT, NO THUMBS UP 
AND DOWN. 
I WENT BACK. 
JUDGE THOROUGH GOOD MARSHALL 
WAS ASKED REPEATEDLY IN HIS 
HEARING, WHAT DO YOU THINK 
ABOUT MIRANDA, WHAT DO YOU 
THINK ABOUT MIRANDA, WHAT DO 
YOU THINK ABOUT MIRANDA. 
>> I GOT IT. 
EVERYBODY ELSE DOES IT AND YOUR 
ANSWER IS STILL NO. 
>> BUT THE REASON EVERYONE ELSE 
DOES IT IS ROOTED IN -- IT'S MY 
RESPECT FOR NOMINEE PRECEDENT 
AND MY RESPECT FOR JUDICIAL 
INDEPENDENCE, SO I CAN'T GIVE 
ASSURANCES ON A SPECIFIC 
HYPOTHETICAL -- 
>> OKAY. 
THANK YOU. 
LET ME GO ON TO ANOTHER SUBJECT 
WHICH IS EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE IS A 
PRINCIPLE THAT IS FOUMEDDED IN 
THE CONSTITUTION IN THE 
SEPARATION OF POWERS, CORRECT? 
>> THE SUPREME COURT SO RULED 
IN THE UNITED STATES VERSUS 
RICHARD NIXON CASE. 
SO THAT WAS THE FIRST -- THE 
KY ISSUE IN UNITED STATES -- 
>> THAT'S ALL RIGHT. 
I JUST NEEDED THE ANSWER TO THE 
QUESTION AND YOU'VE ANSWERED 
IT. 
>> THE SOURCE IS IMPORTANT. 
>> THE -- AS A PRIVILEGE IT 
NEEDS TO BE ASSERTED, DOES IT 
NOT, THAT'S TRUE OF PRIVILEGES 
GENERALLY? 
>> I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS IS 
GOING -- PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD 
QUESTION. 
DON'T PRIVILEGES NEED TO BE 
ASSERTED IN ORDER TO APPLY? 
>> WELL, PRIVILEGES ARE 
RECOGNIZED -- 
>> ONCE THEY'RE ASSERTED. 
>> I THINK AS A GENERAL 
PROPOSITION. 
>> FAIR ENOUGH. 
I'M ONLY ASKING AS A GENERAL 
PROPOSITION. 
>> IN AN ATTORNEY/CLIENT 
PRIVILEGE YOU WOULD ASSERT THE 
PRIVILEGE. 
>> AND WHO EXERTS EXECUTIVE 
PRIVILEGE? 
>> ORDINARILY -- WELL, THAT IS 
A COMPLICATED QUESTION, 
SENATOR. 
ACTUALLY -- 
>> WHO DOES IT COME BACK TO? 
ULTIMATELY WHO ASSERTS 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE? 
>> SO IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE 
TALKING ABOUT, SO WHAT KIND OF 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH DOCUMENT 
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, IT 
DEPENDS. 
IN MY EXPERIENCE -- 
>> ULTIMATELY IT'S THE 
PRESIDENT. 
>> THERE'S NOT AS MUCH 
PRECEDENT ON THAT. 
THERE'S SOME. 
IN THE SUPREME COURT, THIS WAS 
-- THE SUPREME COURT IN THE 
UNITED STATES VERSUS RICHARD 
NIXON -- 
>> ISN'T IT FAIR TO SAY THAT 
EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE BELONGS TO 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE? 
>> YEAH, IT CAN ALSO BELONG TO 
THE FORMER PRESIDENT IN THE 
CASE OF FORMER PRESIDENTIAL 
RECORDS, THAT'S ONE CAVEAT I 
WANT TO PUT ON THAT. 
>> FAIR CAVEAT. 
IS THE ASSERTION OF EXECUTIVE 
PRIVILEGE BY THE PRESIDENT 
SUBJECT TO JUDICIAL REVIEW? 
>> WELL, OF COURSE BECAUSE 
UNDER THE PRECEDENT, UNITED 
STATES VERSUS RICHARD NIXON 
SAID TWO THINGS. 
IT SAID, ONE, THE EXECUTIVE 
PRIVILEGE IS CONSTITUTIONALLY 
ROOTED. 
THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IN THAT 
CASE ACTUALLY ARGUED THERE IS 
NO SUCH THING AS EXECUTIVE 
PRIVILEGE AND THE SUPREME COURT 
REJECTED THAT ARGUMENT AND HELD 
THAT THE EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE IS 
ROOTED IN THE SEPARATION OF 
POWERS AND IN ARTICLE 2. BUT -- 
>> THE REASON I'M ASKING 
DOESN'T HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH 
YOU. 
IT GOES BACK TO A POINT THAT WE 
WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER IN 
THE HEARING WHICH IS THAT WE 
HAVE RECEIVED HUNDREDS AND 
HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS 
OF YOUR RECORD THAT LOOK LIKE 
THIS, THEY BOTH SAY COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL ACROSS THEM AT AN 
ANGLE, AND THEN ACROSS THE 
FRONT THEY SAY CONSTITUTIONAL 
PRIVILEGE AND AS A MEMBER OF 
THE SENATE, THIS IS NOT A 
QUESTION, I'M SPEAKING TO MY 
COLLEAGUE, I FIND MYSELF IN A 
QUANDARY HERE ABOUT BEING 
DENIED THOSE PARTICULAR 
DOCUMENTS BECAUSE I CANNOT FIND 
ANY ASSERTION OF THE PRIVILEGE, 
THESE DOCUMENTS JUST SUDDENLY 
APPEARED AND SOMEBODY HAD PUT 
CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE ON THE 
PAGE AND WIPED OUT ALL THE TEXT 
THAT WAS ON THE PAGE, AND MY 
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE'S 
ORDINARILY A PROCESS 
. 
>> I DON'T THINK FORMAL 
ASSERTIONS USUALLY OCCUR UNTIL 
AFTER THERE HAS BEEN A SUBPOENA 
FROM MY TIME. 
>> WHICH IS WHY NOT BEING ABLE 
TO GET A SUBPOENA KIND OF  
BALLICKS THE PROCESS.  
THE ROLE OF THE FEDERAL SOCIETY 
IN BRINGING YOU HERE TODAY HAS 
BEEN OF INTEREST TO ME.  
AS YOU KNOW WE SPOKE ABOUT IT A 
LOT WHEN YOU AND I MET IN MY 
OFFICE.  
MR. GUNN SITTING VERY  
APPRECIATELY BEHIND YOU,  I CAN 
SEE HIM OVER YOUR SHOULDER,  
HAS SAID THE FEDERAL SOCIETY 
WAS INSOURCED INTO THE WHITE 
HOUSE TO MAKE THESE EMOTIONS,  
SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU SHOULD 
BE THE NOMINEE.  
YOU HAVE SAID THIS REGARDING 
PRESIDENT  BUSH.  
THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS,  AND I 
AM  QUOTING HERE,  IMPROPER TO 
GIVE ONE GROUP,  ESPECIALLY A 
GROUP WITH INTERESTS IN MANY  
ISSUES,  A PREFERRED OR FAVORED 
POSITION IN THE NOMINATION 
PROCESS.  
THAT WAS -- THOSE WERE YOUR 
WORDS SPEAKING TO THE FEDERAL 
SOCIETY,  THE NATIONAL LAWYER'S 
CONVENTION.  
ON ANOTHER OCCASION YOU WROTE A 
DRAFT SPEECH FOR ATTORNEY 
GENERAL GONZALEZ,  OR WHITE 
HOUSE COUNCIL GONZALEZ,  
PROBABLY WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL 
GONZALEZ LOOKING AT THE DATE,  
TO DELIVER TO THE FEDERALIST 
SOCIETY.  
YOU SAID IN THAT SPEECH,  AS A 
MATTER OF CONSTITUTIONAL 
PRINCIPLE,  IT IS SIMPLY 
INPROPER,  WE BELIEVE,  TO 
AFFORD ANY OUTSIDE GROUP A 
QUASI OFFICIAL ROLE IN THE 
PRESIDENT'S NOMINATION PROCESS. 
HOW DO YOU SQUARE THOSE TWO 
ROLES WITH THE ROLE IN YOUR 
NOMINATION PROCESS,  ASSUMING 
MR. McGUNN HAD BEEN SPEAKING 
ACCURATELY. 
>> I CAN SPEAK TO THE  ADA PART 
OF THAT.  
PRESIDENT BUSH  IN 2001 HAD TO 
MAKE A DECISION HOW THE ADA 
SHOULD PLAY ITS USUAL RATING 
ROLE WITH RESPECT TO NOMINEES 
AND THE ADA TAKES FILES AND 
BRIEFS AND POLICY POSITIONS ON 
ISSUES,  AND THEREFORE,  AFTER 
SOME DELIBERATION IT WAS 
DECIDED THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG 
WITH THE  ADA RATING THE 
NOMINEES BUT TO GIVE THE 
ORGANIZATION THAT FILES THE 
MICA BRIEFS AND  TAKES POLICY 
POSITIONS A PREFERRED ROLE IN 
THE CONSTITUTION NOMINATION 
PROCESS WAS UNFAIR IN SOME WAYS 
IN FAVORING IT. 
>> A FAIR DESCRIPTION OF THE 
FEDERALIST SOCIETY'S ROLE IN 
YOUR SELECTION AS THE NOMINEE 
TO SAY IT WAS PREFERRED OVER 
OTHER GROUPS? 
>> WELL,  MY EXPERIENCE WAS 
WHEN JUSTICE KENNEDY RETIRED ON 
THE  WEDNESDAY, MR. MCGAHN 
CALLED ME LATER THAT AFTERNOON 
AND SAID WE NEED TO TALK ON 
FRIDAY.  
HE CAME OVER TO MY OFFICE ON 
FRIDAY  EVENING,  OR LATE 
AFTERNOON.  
WE TALKED FOR THREE OR FOUR 
HOURS.  
INTERVIEW AND GOING THROUGH THE 
USUAL KINDS OF QUESTIONS YOU 
WOULD GO THROUGH WHEN YOU ARE 
EMBARKING ON A PROCESS LIKE 
THIS.  
I MET WITH THE INTERVIEW WITH 
THE PRESIDENT ON MONDAY MORNING 
-- 
>> IT YOUR TESTIMONY THAT YOU 
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ROLE OF THE 
FEDERALIST SOCIETY WAS IN YOUR 
SELECTION? 
>> MY EXPERIENCE OF MY PERSONAL 
EXPERIENCE AND WHAT I KNOW IS 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE THE 
DECISION FOR STARTERS.  
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE THE 
NOMINATION.  
I KNOW,  AS HE EXPLAINED 
YESTERDAY,  I KNOW HE SPENT A 
LOT OF TIME IN THOSE 12 DAYS ON 
THIS ISSUE AND I WAS AWARE OF 
THAT.  
I ALSO KNOW THAT MR. MCGAHN WAS 
DIRECTLY INVOLVED WHERE ME AND 
SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON IT.  
I ALSO KNOW THE VICE PRESIDENT 
-- 
>> YOU HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE TO 
SHARE WITH US TODAY ABOUT THE 
ROLE OF THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 
AND HOW THEY WERE INSOURCED 
INTO THE WHITE HOUSE? 
THAT IS A MYSTERY TO YOU AS 
WELL AS TO US? 
>> I AM NOT SURE WHAT MR. 
MCGAHN MEANT BY THAT COMMENT.  
I THINK FEDERAL SOCIETY MEMBERS 
ARE -- THE LAWYERS IN THE 
ADMINISTRATION ARE FEDERAL 
SOCIETY MEMBERS,  SO IT SHOULD 
NOT BE A SURPRISE THAT BECAUSE 
IT IS AN ORGANIZATION. 
>> LEARNED LEO'S ROLE 
SPECIFICALLY FROM THE 
FEDERALIST SOCIETY? 
>> I DON'T KNOW. 
>> OKA 
>> I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS. 
>> WELL,  LET'S GO FROM 
SPECIFICS TO GENERALS AND LET 
ME PUT UP A GRAPHIC THAT SHOWS 
SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO FUND THE 
FEDERALISTS SOCIETY.  
IT IS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT 
GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT SEND TO 
SHARE CONSERVATIVE AND PRO-
CORPORATE POINTS OF VIEW.  
IT REFLECTS THAT AT LEAST 14 OF 
THE  DONORS ARE ACTUALLY 
ANONYMOUS WHICH IS A VERY 
UNFORTUNATE PART OF OUR CURRENT 
POLITICAL WORLD.  
PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT,  
BECAUSE DONORS TRUST HERE IS AN 
ORGANIZATION WHOSE SOLE SUPER 
IS TO LAUNDER THE IDENTITY OFF 
OF BIG DONORS SO THAT A 
RECIPIENT OF FUNDS CAN REPORT 
THAT THEY GOT THE MONEY FROM 
DONOR'S TRUST RATHER THAN THE 
TRUE PARTY IN INTEREST,  SO WE 
DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH ANONYMOUS 
MONEY FLOWED THROUGH THEM.  
BUT I WOULD CONTEND THAT THIS 
IS A PRETTY STRONG GROUP OF 
RIGHT-WINGED CONSERVATIVE  PRO-
CORPORATE FUNDERS. 
AND PRESUMING THAT TO BE TRUE,  
SHOULD THAT GIVE YOU OR ANYONE 
IN THIS PROCESS PAUSE THAT 
GROUPS LIKE THIS MAY HAVE HAD 
SUCH A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN 
SELECTING YOU TO BE IN THIS 
SEAT TODAY? 
>> SENATOR,  MR. MCGAHN WAS THE 
ONE WHO  CONTACTED ME.  
I INTERVIEWED WITH THE 
PRESIDENT AND I KNOW THE 
PRESIDENT WAS,  I AM THE 
PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE.  
HE WAS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN 
MAKING THAT DECISION.  
I AM SURE HE CONSULTED WITH MR. 
MCGAHN.  
I AM SURE HE CONSULTED VERY 
WIDELY TO GET INPUT AT LEAST ON 
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE FINALISTS,  
SO THAT THAT PART OF IT,  MY  
12-DAY EXPERIENCE,  WAS WITH 
THE WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL'S 
OFFICE AND THE PRESIDENT AND 
2nd  BASE,  TOO,  SO,  I AM NOT 
FAMILIAR WITH THE RULES -- 
>> DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT THE 
ROLES OF THE  FEDERALIST 
SOCIETY WAS IN ALL THIS -- 
THERE IS PLENTY OF REPORTING,  
WE DON'T NEED TO LITIGATE THAT 
BETWEEN US,  YOU DON'T KNOW YOU 
TESTIFIED AND THAT IS FINE. 
>> MY PROCESS,  AND AGAIN,  YE 
>> BUT YOU ARE FAIRLY FAMILIAR 
WITH THE PROCESS GENERALLY 
BECAUSE YOU USED  TO RUN IT IN 
THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE,  OR HAVE 
A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN IT,  THE 
PROCESS OF JUDICIAL NOMINATION 
SELECTION,  JUDICIAL NOMINEE 
SELECTION,  CORRECT? 
>> I DID NOT RUN IT.  
JUDGE GONZALEZ WHEN I WAS IN 
THE COUNCIL'S OFFICE WAS THE 
COUNCIL -- 
>> BUT YOU HAVE BEEN INSIDE THE 
PROCESS? 
>> I HAVE BEEN INSIDE THE 
PROCESS,  YES. 
>> SO,  THE NEXT THING THAT 
HAPPENS GOING FORWARD IS THAT 
WE SEE THE JUDICIAL CRISIS  
NETWORK SHOWING UP AND THEY 
SPEND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO RUN ADS  
URGING SENATORS TO SUPPORT YOU. 
NOW,  I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN 
SHOW THOSE ARE THE SAME FUNDERS 
BECAUSE THEY ARE ENGAGED,  AS 
YOU KNOW,  IN DARK MONEY 
FUNDING.  
THEY DON'T REPORT THEIR DONORS, 
BUT I WOULD BE PREPARED  TO 
MAKE A VERY SUBSTANTIAL BET 
THAT THERE IS ENORMOUS OVERPASS 
BETWEEN THE FUNDERS OF THE 
JUDICIAL CRISIS NETWORK 
CAMPAIGN FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION, 
AND THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY 
DONOR GROUP TO THE EXTENT THAT 
WE ARE AWARE OF AND SINCE SO 
MANY OF THEM ARE ANONYMOUS.  
HYPOTHETICALLY,  SHOULD THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE CONCERN 
ABOUT THE ROLE OF VERY,  VERY 
BIG  SPENDERS AND INFLUENCERS 
DOING THINGS LIKE BEING 
INVOLVED IN THE SELECTION OF A 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE AND  
RUNNING DARK MONEY CAMPAIGNS TO 
SUPPORT THE CONFIRMATION OF A 
NOMINEE? 
IS THERE ANY CAUSE FOR CONCERN 
THERE AT A GENERAL  
PROPOSITION? 
>> SIR,  THERE IS A LOT OF 
GENERAL PREMISES IN YOUR 
QUESTION THAT I AM NOT SURE. 
>> I AM ASKING YOU TO ACCEPT 
THE HYPOTHETICAL.  
IF THERE WERE VERY,  VERY 
SIGNIFICANT BIG SPECIAL 
INTEREST FUNDING BEHIND THE 
ORGANIZATION THAT WAS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR SELECTING YOU 
AND RECOMMENDING TO THE 
PRESIDENT THAT HE NOMINATE YOU, 
AND,  AGAIN,  FROM A VERY 
SIMILAR GROUP IN  SUPPORTING 
THE DARK MONEY CAMPAIGNS 
RUNNING ON YOUR BEHALF FOR YOUR 
CONFIRMATION,  WOULD THAT BE A 
MATTER OF CONCERN,  OR IS THAT 
ALL JUST FINE AND WE SHOULDN'T 
EVEN CARE ABOUT GETTING THE  
ANSWERS? 
>> SO,  TWO THINGS,  SENATOR.  
ONE IS DESCRIBE THE PROCESS I 
WENT THROUGH WITH  MR. MCGAHN,  
THE PRESIDENT,  VICE PRESIDENT 
AND THE SELECTION.  
THAT IS WHAT I KNOW ABOUT MY 
PROCESS.  
TWO,  ON THE ADS,  THERE ARE A 
LOT OF ADS AGAINST ME AS WELL.  
AND I HAVE SEEN THOSE.  
AND,  YOU KNOW,  OUR FAMILIES 
HAVE SEEN THOSE.  
AND THERE ARE ADS FOR ME AND WE 
HAVE SEEN THOSE,  TOO.  
AS CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS SAID 
IN HIS HEARING,  IT IS A FREE 
COUNTRY AND THERE ARE ADS FOR 
AND AGAINST AND OBVIOUSLY -- 
>> SHOULD WE AS CITIZENS KNOW 
WHO THEY ARE? 
WHO IS FUNDING THE ADS,  JUST 
AS A MATTER OF CITIZENSHIP? 
>> I THINK THAT IS FIRST AND 
FOREMOST A POLICY QUESTION FOR 
THE CONGRESS TO DECIDE ON WHAT 
DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS IT 
WANTS TO PUT IN.  
AND IF THOSE DISCLOSURE 
REQUIREMENTS WERE PUT IN OR 
STATE GOVERNMENTS COULD TRY TO 
MAKE DISCLOSURE RETIREMENTS,  
THEY COULD TRY IT AND THIS WILL 
BE -- REQUIREMENTS AND THEY 
COULD TRY IT AND THERE WOULD 
UNDOUBTLY BE CHALLENGES TO THAT 
AND WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE 
TO THAT,  THAT WOULD COME TO 
THE OPEN COURT AND I WOULD KEEP 
AN OPEN MIND ON THAT UNDER THE 
PRECEDENT AND FIRST AMENDMENT 
LAW.  
THE POLICY IS TO FIRST 
DETERMINE,  ASSESS AND STUDY 
EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF DISCLOSURE 
REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE PUT IN 
PLACE. 
>> I UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL 
HAZARD THERE.  
IS IT THE UNLEASHED POWER OF 
UNLIMITED POLITICAL DARK MONEY 
THEN BECOMES LIKE A RATCHET.  
THE OBSTACLE TO SOLVING THAT 
PROBLEM.  
I HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT 
AS A MATTER OF POLITICADO INSTA 
ABOUT MONEY IN THE POLITICAL 
SYSTEM.  
MY WORK FOR,  AND THE TIME IT 
TAKES ALL OF  YOU,  AND WHEN I 
WORKED FOR PRESIDENT BUSH IN 
THE '03-'04 TIMEFRAME,  FOR 
EXAMPLE,  HOW MANY FUNDRAISER 
HE HAD TO DO GOING BACK TO THE 
SEPTEMBER 11 POINT,  HE HAD TO 
DO A LOT OF FOLLOWED UPPING FOR 
BEING PRESIDENT WHILE BOROUGH 
PRESIDENT. 
>> NOW YOU CAN SET UP A 501C4 
AND DROP TENS OF MILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS,  LIKE THAT,  DROP IT 
AND THE PUBLIC DOESN'T KNOW WHO 
IS BEHIND IT.  
ONLY VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE 
GOTTEN IN ON IT.  
IT HAS GOTTEN EASIER SINCE 
PRESIDENT BUSH BUT NOT BETTER. 
>> IF YOU ARE RUNNING FOR RE-
ELECTION AND A THIRD PARTY 
GROUP COMES  IN AGAINST YOU,  
YOU HAVE TO GO OUT IN THE 
FUNDRAISING AND SPEND EVEN MORE 
TIME,  THAT IS PART OF THE 
CONCERN I HEARD OVER THE YEARS 
GENERALLY IS THE TIME THAT EACH 
OF YOU HAS TO SPEND,  AND THE 
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE -- 
>> LET ME CONTINUE ON FORWARD 
THROUGH THIS PROBLEM OF 
FUNDERS.  
ON THE COURT,  ON THE D.C. 
CIRCUIT AND POTENTIALLY ON THE 
SUPREME COURT,  YOU WILL OFTEN 
SEE CASES BROUGHT BY GROUPS 
LIKE,  FOR INSTANCE,  THE 
PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION.  
ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THAT 
GROUP? 
>> I HAVE SEEN BRIEFS BY THE 
PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION. 
>> DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO? 
>> I WILL TAKE YOUR 
DESCRIPTION. 
>> MY DESCRIPTION IS THAT THEY 
GET MONEY FROM RIGHT-WINGED 
CONSERVATIVE AND CORPORATE 
INTERESTS AND THEY LOOK FOR 
CASES AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT 
THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN USE TO 
BRING ARGUMENTS BEFORE THE 
COURT.  
I ARGUED AGAINST THEM IN THE 
SUPREME COURT AT ONE POINT.  
THEY CAME ALL THE WAY ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY TO THE SHORES OF 
WINNEPAUK POND,  RHODE ISLAND,  
TO HIRE A CLIENT WHOSE CASE 
THEY COULD TAKE TO THE SUPREME 
COURT WITH A PURPOSE TO MAKE A 
POINT.  
THEY ARE NOT ALONE IN  DOING 
THIS.  
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SIMILAR 
GROUPS WHO PERFORM THIS  
SERVICE.  
AND IT CAUSES ME TO THINK THAT 
SOMETIMES THE TRUE PARTY IN 
INTEREST IS ACTUALLY NOT THE 
NAMED PARTY BEFORE THE COURT,  
BUT RATHER THE LEGAL GROUP THAT 
HAS HIRED THE CLIENT AND 
BROUGHT THEM TO THE COURT MORE 
OR LESS AS A PROBLEM IN ORDER 
TO MAKE ARGUMENTS TRYING TO 
DIRECT THE COURT IN A 
PARTICULAR DIRECTION.  
IS THAT AN UNREASONABLE CONCERN 
FOR US TO HAVE ABOUT THE 
PROCESS? 
>> SENATOR,  I THINK THERE ARE 
PUBLIC INTEREST LITIGATION 
GROUPS SPANNING THE IDEOLOGICAL 
SPECTRUM THAT LOOK FOR CASES TO 
WEIGH IN ON IN THE MICUS BRIEFS 
AND THERE HAVE BEEN 
HISTORICALLY,  YOU LOOK FOR,  
AS I UNDERSTAND IT,  PREMIUM 
TRYING TO IDENTIFY SUITABLE 
PLAINTIFFS TO CHALLENGE,  AND 
THIS AGAIN IS ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM.  
>> VERY POWERFUL INTERESS CAN 
COME BEHIND AN AM I CUSS GROUP 
AND NOBODY KNOWS WHO -- AMICUS 
GROUP AND NOBODY REALLY KNOWS 
WHO IS OF INTEREST. 
ANOTHER THING THAT IS OF 
CONCERN IS WHEN YOU SEE THESE 
SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS RUSHING 
OUT TO LOSE  CASES IN FORD GET 
IN FRONT OF A FRIENDLY COURT.  
IT WOULD SEEM OF INTEREST FOR 
SOMEBODY THATS THAT TRIED 
CASES,  BEEN AROUND COURTROOMS 
A LOT,  SEEN A LOT OF GREAT 
LITIGATIONS AND LITIGATOR,  I 
HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY ONCE 
TRY TO LOSE A LEGITIMATE CASE.  
IN THE WAKE OF JUSTICE  ALEE 
TOE'S SIGNALING OF WHAT WAS 
THEN FREDERICK AND JANICE AND 
RUSH OUT AND ASK THE COURT TO 
RULE AGAINST THEM TO GET HOT 
FOOT SO THEY CAN EXPECT A GOOD 
OUTCOME,  TO ME THAT DOESN'T 
SEEM RIGHT.  
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS 
SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON,  
HAVING REAL PARTIES AND REAL 
ARGUMENTS AND THE SUPREME COURT 
PROPERLY PREPARED REAL 
DISPUTES.  
DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERN ABOUT 
THE OPTICS OF PEOPLE RUSHING TO 
LOSE CASES BELOW TO COME BEFORE 
WHAT THEY THINK IS A FRIENDLY 
SUPREME COURT? 
DOES THAT SEEM A LITTLE ODD? 
>> I WILL --  
SENATOR,  I AM NOT ENTIRELY 
FAMILIAR WITH THAT PHENOMENON.  
I WOULD BE INTERESTED MORE IN 
-- 
>> I MIGHT FOLLOW-UP WITH A 
QUESTION FOR THE RECORD TO GET 
YOUR MORE DELIBERATE THOUGHTS 
ABOUT IT. 
>> AND ON YOUR AMICUS THOUGHT,  
I AM  INTERESTED IN THE 
SPECIFICS OF YOUR PROPOSAL AND 
CERTAINLY IF CONFIRMED,  I 
WOULD -- 
>> HERE IS THE CONCERN.  
YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT 
THE COURT DEPENDS ON AS MUCH,  
IF  ANYTHING,  ON ITS 
REPUTATION.  
YOU DON'T HAVE A PURSE AND YOU 
DON'T HAVE AN ARMY.  
YOU STAND ON YOUR REPUTATION IN 
THE JUDICIARY AND YOU MUST NOT 
ONLY ACT JUSTLY BUT BE SEEN TO 
ACT  JUSTLY.  
WHAT I LAID OUT IS A SCENARIO 
IN WHICH VERY BIG SPECIAL 
INTERESTS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT 
ROLE IN  FUNDING THE GROUP THAT 
I BELIEVE,  AND MUCH REPORTING 
SAYS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING 
YOU TO THE TOP OF THE GRACIE 
POLE OF NOMINEE SELECTION AND 
THAT THE SAME FUNDERS ARE 
BEHIND THE JUDICIAL CRISIS  
NETWORK OPERATION THAT IS 
POLITICALLY PUSHING FOR YOU 
THAT THE --   
>> SENATOR,  WE WILL ADD ONE 
MINUTE TO YOUR  TIME.-- 
>> THAT SOME PORTION OF THE 
SUPREME COURT'S DOCKET IS MADE 
UP OF STRATEGIC CASES RATHER 
THAN REAL LITIGATION IN WHICH 
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO HAVE TO 
FIND -- 
>>> WE WANT TO BREAK AWAY FOR A 
MOMENT AND TAKE YOU TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE.  
MOMENTS AGO THE PRESIDENT 
PRAISED HIS SUPREME COURT PICK. 
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN. 
>> HE IS AN OUTSTANDING 
INTELLECT,  AN  OUTSTANDING 
JUDGE.  
HE WAS BORN FOR THE POSITION,  
I HEARD AS LONG AS TEN YEARS 
AGO PEOPLE WERE SAYING HE 
SHOULD BE A SUPREME COURT 
JUDGE.  
I DIDN'T KNOW HIM AT THE TIME 
BUT I WAS HEARING FROM A LOT OF 
PEOPLE,  FRIENDS OF MINE FROM 
WASHINGTON AND OTHER PLACES,  
SAYING THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH 
SHOULD BE A SUPREME COURT JUDGE 
SOME DAY.  
I AM HONORED THAT I GAVE HIM 
THE CHANCE.  
I HAVE WATCHED HIS REMARKS,  I 
HAVE WATCHED HIS PERFORMANCE,  
I HAVE WATCHED HIS STATEMENTS 
AND,  HONESTLY,  THEY HAVE BEEN 
TOTALLY BRILLIANT.  
I THINK THAT THE OTHER SIDE IS  
GRASPING FOR STRAWS AND REALLY 
THE OTHER SIDE SHOULD EMBRACE 
HIM BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER FIND 
BETTER IN TERMS OF TALENT OR 
INTERSECT THAN WHAT YOU HAVE IN 
-- INTELLECT THAN WHAT YOU HAVE 
IN BRETT KAVANAUGH.  
 
>> THE BOOK MEANS NOTHING.  
IT IS A WORK OF FICTION.  
ALREADY GENERAL MATTIS HAS COME 
OUT VERY,  VERY STRONGLY AND I 
THINK YOU KNOW GENERAL MATTIS.  
HE DOES WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.  
HE WAS A VERY INDEPENDENT GUY.  
HE WAS INSULTED BY THE REMARKS 
ATTRIBUTED  TO HIM AND CAME OUT 
WITH A VARY STRONG STATEMENT.  
I ASSUME YOU READ IT,  I HOPE 
YOU READ IT.  
GENERAL JOHN KELLY THE SAME 
THING.  
HE WAS INSULTED BY WHAT THEY 
SAID.  
HE IS RIGHT HERE.  
HE COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT THEY 
SAID.  
HE PUT OUT A VERY,  VERY STRONG 
STATEMENT AND MANY  OTHERS AND 
OTHER STATEMENTS  ARE COMING 
OUT.  
THE BOOK IS A WORK OF FICTION.  
IF YOU LOOK BACK AT WOODWARD'S 
PAST,  HE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM 
WITH OTHER PRESIDENTS.  
HE LIKES TO GET PUBLICITY,  
SELL BOOKS,  BUT WE HAVE DONE 
MORE AS A ADMINISTRATION,  MORE 
THAN ANY OTHER ADMINISTRATION 
IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS.  
IT IS INCREDIBLE.  
WE WILL SOON BE APPROACHING TWO 
YEARS.  
BUT THERE IS NO ADMINISTRATION 
PROBABLY -- AND EVEN YOU FOLKS 
HAVE GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED 
THIS -- HAS DONE MORE WORK.  
TAX  CUTS,  REGULATION CUTS,  
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES,  THE 
COURT SYSTEM  GENERALLY AND SO 
MUCH MORE.  
EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE HEALTH 
CARE PROGRAMS WE ARE PASSING 
AND OWL OF THE THINGS WE HAVE 
-- ALL OF THE  THINGS WE HAVE 
DONE.  
WE ARE SAVING SOCIAL SECURITY.  
THE DEMOCRATS WILL DESTROY 
SOCIAL SECURITY.  
WE ARE SAVING MEDICARE.  
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO DESTROY  
MEDICARE.  
YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE 
DOING,  ME WILL DESTROY 
MEDICARE,  AND WE WILL SAVE IT, 
KEEP IT GOING.  
WE ARE MAKE IT STRONGER.  
WE ARE MAKING SOCIAL SECURITY 
STRONGER.  
WE ARE MAKING OUR WHOLE COUNTRY 
STRONGER.  
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT 
THE ACHIEVEMENTS.  
BUT I WAS VERY HONORED WHEN 
WITHOUT MY EVEN KNOWING ABOUT 
IT,  STATEMENTS WERE PUT OUT BY 
GENERAL KELLY,  GENERAL MATTIS, 
HIGHLY RESPECTED PEOPLE BY 
EVERYBODY,  INCLUDING 
YOURSELVES.  
AND THE BOOK IS A WORK OF 
FICTION.  
IT REALLY -- IF YOU LOOK AT IT, 
IT WAS PUT OUT TO  INTERFERE,  
IN MY OPINION WITH THE 
KAVANAUGH HEARINGS WHICH I 
DON'T THINK IT HAS DONE BECAUSE 
SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE COME OUT 
AGAINST IT.  
SO MANY PEOPLE THAT WERE 
WRITTEN ABOUT SAID INER SAID 
THAT.  
RUDY GIULIANI IS VERY INSULTED 
BY THE BACK,  WHAT WAS STATED 
IN THE BOOK.  
SO WE RUN A STRONG WHITE HOUSE. 
THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT,  
AND WE ARE  DOING THINGS THAT 
NOBODY ELSE HAS EVER BEEN ABLE 
TO DO,  AND OUR COUNTRY IS 
STRONGER NOW THAN IT HAS EVER 
BEEN AND IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD 
OF TIME $700 MILLION BEING 
SPENT ON THE MILITARY.  
THE NEXT YEAR  $716 BILLION.  
WE WILL ACTUALLY BE FAR 
STRONGER THAN WE HAVE EVER BEEN 
AND THAT IS WHAT WE  NEEDED  TO 
BE.  
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. 
 
. 
>> WE HAVE A GREAT 
RELATIONSHIP.  
FIRST OF ALL,  I HAVE A GREAT 
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH AMIR 
AND KUWAIT IS A PLACE I HAVE 
FRIEND AS LONG TIME.  
MANY FRIENDS LIVE IN FRANKSLY 
WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK MOSTLY. 
I KNOW SEAN HAVE KNOWN THEM A 
LONG -- I KNOW AND HAVE KNOWN 
THEM A LONG TIME,  VERY FINE 
PEOPLE.  
OUR RELATIONSHIP AND BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP IS VERY,  VERY 
POWERFUL.  
VERY STRONG.  
AND THEY VIEW US AS A PLACE 
WHERE THEY HAVE DONE VERY WELL 
AND THEY LIKE TO INVEST THEIR 
MONEY IN THE UNITED STATES,  SO 
WE LIKE THAT.  
 
>> SO,  CANADA IS  MEETING WITH 
US RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK.  
WE HAVE TO MAKE A FAIR DEAL 
WITH CANADA.  
THEY CHARGE US 300% ON DAIRY 
PRODUCTS WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE 
NEVER UNDERSTOOD.  
THEY HAVE WALLS UP WITH US 
DOING BUSINESS IN CANADA,  YET 
THEY COME AND DO BUSINESS WITH 
US.  
WE CAN'T LET THAT  HAPPEN.  
LOOK,  WE HAVE A VERY STRONG 
POSITION.  
WE ARE THE ONES THAT PEOPLE 
WANT TO COME IN AND TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF.  
I AM NOT BLAMING CANADA.  
I LOVE CANADA AND THE PEOPLE OF 
CANADA,  BUT THEY AND OTHER 
COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN TAKING 
ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES 
FOR MANY YEARS AND THIS IS A 
PRESIDENT THAT HAS STOPPED IT.  
WE HAVE MADE A DEAL WITH MEXICO 
AND MEXICO HAS BEEN TERRIFIC TO 
DEAL WITH,  INCLUDING THEIR NEW 
PRESIDENT WHO I SPOKE WITH AND 
I THINK WE WILL HAVE A VERY 
GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH MEXICO 
GOING FORWARD AND THE DEAL IS A 
MUCH MORE FAIR DEAL BETWEEN THE 
UNITED STATES AND MEXICO,  
BECAUSE NAFTA GOES DOWN AS ONE 
OF THE WORST TRADE DEALS IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.  
IT EMPTIED OUT MILLIONS OF 
JOBS.  
IT EMPTIED OUT FACTORIES AND 
PLANTS ALL OVER THE UNITED 
STATES.  
IT WAS A VERY UNFAIR DEAL AND 
FOOLISH DEAL,  IN FACT,  A VERY 
STUPID DEAL FOR THE UNITED 
STATES TO MAKE.  
WE ARE STRAIGHTENING OUT THESE 
HORRIBLE TRADE DEALS.  
WE HAD 4.1GDP.  
JUST RAISED TO 4.2.  
NOBODY THOUGHT THAT WAS 
POSSIBLE.  
WHEN THE TRADE DEALS ARE FIXED 
AND MADE FAIR,  GDP WILL GO 
EVEN HIGHER AND POTENTIALLY 
MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT.  
AND IF YOU GO BACK TO ELECTIONS 
AND CAMPAIGNING,  NOBODY EVER 
WOULD HAVE SAID THAT WAS 
POSSIBLE EXCEPT ME AND MAYBE A 
FEW  OTHERS THAT BELIEVE IN ME. 
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.  
 
. 
>> ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.  
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. 
 
. 
>> WHAT,  NORTH KOREA? 
DID YOU SAY SYRIA? 
YES.  
I THINK IT IS A VERY SAD 
SITUATION AND THE PROVINCE,  
WHAT IS GOING ON THERE IS BEING 
SURROUNDED AND THEY FEEL THEY 
HAVE 35,000 OF THEIR ENEMY 
THERE AND YET YOU HAVE 3 
MILLION PEOPLE LIVING THERE AND 
I JUST TELL YOU THAT THEY WILL 
HOPEFULLY BE VERY,  VERY 
JUDICIOUS AND CAREFUL,  BECAUSE 
THE WORLD IS WATCHING.  
THERE CANNOT BE A SLAUGHTER.  
IF THERE IS A SLAUGHTER THE 
WORLD WILL GET VERY,  VERY 
ANGRY AND THE UNITED STATES 
WILL GET VERY,  VERY ANGRY,  
TOO.  
I AM WATCHING THAT VERY  
CLOSELY.  
SO IT IS SURROUNDED RIGHT NOW 
AND THE PROVINCE,  SURROUNDED 
BY A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH A LOT 
OF WEAPONS AND THESE ARE 
INNOCENT PEOPLE. 
YOU HAVE 3 MILLION,  AT LEAST,  
INNOCENT PEOPLE THERE.  
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY,  VERY 
CAREFUL.  
AND THE WORLD IS  WATCHING AND 
THE UNITED STATES IS WATCHING 
VRY CLOSELY.  
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,  EVERYBODY.
 
. 
>> NOT AT ALL.  
THE BOOK IS FICTION.  
I HEARD SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY 
SAID THE ASSASSINATION OF THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 
NEVER DISCUSSED.  
THE BOOK IS TOTAL FICTION.  
JUST LIKE HE WROTE IN THE PAST 
ABOUT OTHER PRESIDENTS.  
YOU LOOK AT WHAT HE SAID ABOUT 
PRESIDENT BUSH,  PRESIDENT 
OBAMA,  BIG SCANDALOUS THINGS.  
IT LASTS ABOUT A DAY.  
NO,  THAT WAS NEVER EVEN 
CONTEMPLATED NOR WOULD IT BE 
CONTEMPLATED AND IT SHOULD NOT 
HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT IN THE 
BOOK.  
IT IS JUST MORE FICTION.  
THE BOOK IS TOTAL FICTION.  
 
. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP  WEIGHING IN 
ON BOB WOODWARD'S NEW BOOK,  
CALLING IT PURE FICTION,  ALSO 
SAYING HE IS  WATCHING THE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH HEARINGS ON 
CAPITOL HILL,  SAYING HE IS 
PLEASED WITH IT.  
I WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK TO 
THOSE CONFIRMATION  HEARINGS,  
CURRENTLY UNDER WAY. 
>>> EVEN ON THOSE CASES DECIDED 
5-4,  DOES THE FACT IT WAS 
DECIDED 5-4,  MAKE IT ANY LESS 
OF A LEGITIMATE DECISION? 
DOES IT MAKE THE JUDGMENT ANY 
LESS  BINDING ON THE PARTIES IN 
THAT CASE? 
>> NO,  IT IS STILL A DECISION 
OF THE COURT NO MATTER WHAT THE 
ULTIMATE MAJORITY OPINION IS 
COMPOSED OF. 
>> WOULD IT BEHOOVE A LAWYER 
WHO IS AN OVER OF THE COURT TO 
CALL INTO QUESTION THE 
SUBJECTIVE MOTIVATIONS OF A 
COURT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE 
FACT THAT THIS COURT DECIDED A 
CASE ON A 5-4 BASIS? 
>> WELL,  IF I WERE A LAWYER 
ARGUING BEFORE THE SUPREME 
COURT I PROBABLY WOULD REFRAIN 
FROM QUESTIONS THE MOTIVATIONS 
OF THE JUSTICE.  
I THINK EACH OF THE JUSTICES,  
I KNOW THEM,  THEY ARE ALL 
COMMITTED  TO THE CONSTITUTION 
OF THE UNITED STATES,  
IMPARTIALLY DISCHARGING THEIR 
DUTIES,  OF COURSE HAVE 
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON 
CERTAIN ISSUES,  BUT THEY ARE 
ALL,  I THINK WE ARE FORTUNATE 
TO HAVE A HARD WORKING JUSTICES 
WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING  RECORDS,  
COMMITTED  TO THE CONSTITUTION 
AND COMMITTED  TO THE 
INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY. 
>> WHAT ABOUT IN THE CIRCUIT 
COURT,  IN THE D.C. CIRCUIT 
WHERE YOU HAVE SERVED? 
WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SUGGEST 
THAT A CASE IS SOMEHOW LESS 
LEGITIMATELY DECIDED IF THAT 
CASE WERE DECIDED  ALONG THE 
LINES OF THE PRESIDENT THAT 
APPOINTED WHICH MEMBER OF THE 
D.C. CIRCUIT? 
>> THE PRECEDENT STANDS EITHER 
EITHER WAY.  
THANK YO 
>> I WANT TO GET BACK TO A 
SEPARATION OF POWERS POINT THAT 
HAS COME UP  ALONG VARIOUS 
LINES OF QUESTIONS ASKED BY MY 
COLLEAGUES TODAY.  
IS THE CONSTITUTION RELEGATED  
TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH? 
IS IT SOMETHING THAT IS TO BE 
UPHELD AND INTERPRETED ONLY BY 
THOSE THAT WEAR BLACK ROBES? 
>> NO,  SENATOR.  
LET ME TAKE YOU THROUGH THE 
PROCESS,  I THINK.  
CONGRESS,  OF COURSE,  PASSES 
LAWS AND IN CONSIDERING LAWS,  
CONGRESS WILL ALSO OFTEN ASSESS 
THE POSSIBLE CONSTITUTIONALITY 
OF THE LAWS PASSED.  
SO IN THE FIRST INSTANCE WHEN 
YOU ARE CONSIDERING THE PACKAGE 
OF A LAW,  YOU MIGHT ASSESS THE 
FIRST AMENDMENT IMPLICATIONS OR 
IF IT IS A NATIONAL SECURITY,  
THE FOURTH AMENDMENT 
IMPLICATIONS.  
AND/OR THE DUE PROCESS FIFTH 
AMENDMENT IMPLICATIONS. 
>> AND WE HAVE ALL TAKEN OUR 
OWN OATH TO UPHOLD THE 
CONSTITUTION. 
>> YOU DO YOUR BEST,  THE 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH,  THE 
CONSTITUTION WHETHER TO SIGN 
THE BILL,  FOR EXAMPLE,  FOR 
THE PRESIDENT.  
THE PRESIDENT HAS A 
CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN,  OR A 
POLICY CONCERN,  BUT THE 
PRESIDENT COULD VETO THE BILL 
FOR THAT REASON.  
THAT HAS CERTAINLY HAPPENED 
HISTORICALLY.  
AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE 
COURT,  OF COURSE,  WE ARE -- 
WE ASSESS IN  CASES OF 
CONTROVERSY,  THE 
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF A LAW THAT 
IS CHALLENGED THERE IN THE 
CONTEXT OF A SPECIFIC CASE OR 
CONTROVERSY.  
PRESIDENT WASHINGTON,  GEORGE 
WASHINGTON,  ASKED THE SUPREME 
COURT FOR AN ADVISORY OPINION 
IN HIS FIRST TERM ON A DISPUTED 
LEGAL ISSUE.  
ACTUALLY IT MAY HAVE BEEN A 
SECOND TERM PRESIDENT GEORGIA 
WASHINGTON  ASKING FOR A 
OPINION -- GEORGE WASHINGTON 
ASKED FOR A OPINION.  
THE SUPREME COURT  RESPECTFULLY 
WROTE BACK AND SAID THEY ONLY 
DECIDE CASES AN CONTROVERSIES,  
THERE BY UNDERSCORING THE POINT 
YOU ARE MAKING WITH YOUR 
QUESTION WHICH IS 
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF  LAWS 
ASSESSED IN A -- 
 -- ASSESSED IN THE 
FOR INSTANCE FOR THE CONGRESS 
AND EXECUTIVE. 
>> IT WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE 
FOR US AS MEMBERS OF THE 
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH TO DECIDE TO 
PROTECT SOMETHING WE BELIEVE IS 
CONSTITUTIONALLY  PROTECTED 
REGARDLESS OF WHERE WE MIGHT 
PLACE OUR BETS ON WHAT THE 
COURTS WOULD DO WITH IT.  
IF WE SEE A PARTICULAR RIGHT 
THAT MAY BE JEOPARDIZED BY AN 
ACT OF CONGRESS WE ARE 
CONSIDERING,  IT WOULD NOT BE 
INAPPROPRIATE FOR US TO SAY 
LOOK,  WE ARE NOT SURE EXACTLY 
HOW FAR THE SUPREME COURT WOULD 
GO HERE.  
OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF 
PRECAUTION WE WILL DRAW THE 
LINE MORE CAREFULLY TO MAKE 
SURE WE DON'T STEP INTO 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL TERRITORY? 
>> THAT HAPPENS HISTORICALLY 
AND HAPPENS TODAY.  
THAT UNDERSCORES HOW THE 
CONSTITUTION TILTS TOWARD 
LIBERTY IN SO MANY DIFFERENT 
WAYS.  
IT TILTS TOWARD LIBERTY BECAUSE 
IT IS HARD TO PASS THE LAW,  AS 
YOU KNOW,  WITH BOTH HOUSES AND 
THE PRESIDENT.  
THEN NOT ONLY MIGHT WILL BE 
POLICY OBJECTIONS,  BUT MEMBERS 
OF CONGRESS MAY SAY WELL EVEN 
IF THE SUPREME COURT WOULD 
UPHOLD THIS LAW BASED ON MY 
ASSESSMENT OF THE SUPREME 
COURT,  I HAVE A FIRST 
AMENDMENT OBJECTION,  FOURTH 
AMENDMENT OBJECTION,  EIGHTH 
AMENDMENT CRUEL AND UNUSUAL 
PUNISHMENTS CLAUSE OBJECTION 
AND BASED ON MY VIEW OF THE 
OBJECTION I WILL VOTE NO ON 
THIS LAW.  
THAT IS ANOTHER WAY THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE ALL 
FITS TOGETHER AND TILTS TOWARD 
LIBERTY. 
>> FOR THAT VERY REASON IT 
WOULD PROBABLY LEAD TO BAD 
RESULTS IF FEE WERE NOT TO DO 
THAT.  
IF WE WERE ALWAYS INCLINED  TO 
SAY LET'S JUST PASS THIS IF IT 
IS COUNTRY CONSTITUTIONAL,  THE 
COURT WOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT 
IT.  
DO YOU SEE INSTANCES WHERE THAT 
COULD CREATE PROBLEM 
>> YES,  SENATOR.  
I THINK JUSTICE KENNEDY HAS 
WRITTEN ELOQUENTLY ABOUT THIS.  
EACH OFFICIAL,  EACH MEMBER OF 
CONGRESS,  EACH SENATOR,  THE 
PRESIDENT,  TAKES AN OATH,  OF 
COURSE,  A  CONSTITUTIONAL OATH 
TO  ABIDE BY THE CONSTITUTION.  
THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR EACH 
MEMBER TO UNDERSTAND AND 
UNDERSCORE,  AS I KNOW ALL OF 
YOU DO.  
THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF 
THECEPS OF POWERS PROCESS.-- OF 
THE SEPARATION OF POWERS 
PROCESS.  
I DON'T THINK THE FRAMERS
THOUGHT LET'S PASS SOMETHING 
EVEN THOUGH WE  OURSELVES,  
MEANING THE MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS,  THINK THERE IS A 
CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEM HERE.  
THAT IS NOW HOW IT HAS WORKED  
HISTORICALLY,  NOR DO I THINK 
THAT IS HOW THE FRAMERS 
NECESSARILY INTENDED FOR 
CONGRESS TO WORK. 
>> THERE ARE MYRIAD INSTANCES 
MORE OVER WE MIGHT ENACT 
SOMETHING THAT FOR ONE REASON 
OR ANOTHER MIGHT NOT BE 
CHALLENGED FOR A ALONG TIME,  
OR JUDICIAL  ISSUE,  SOMEBODY 
LACKING UNDERSTANDING,  AND SO 
FORTH. 
>> THAT PARTICULARLY HAPPENS IN 
THE NATIONAL SECURITY CONTEXT,  
I THINK,  SENATOR,  BECAUSE 
THERE IS OFTEN SOMEONE NOT  
WITHSTANDING,  ESPECIALLY IF 
SOMETHING IS BEING DONE IN A 
FOREIGN COUNTRY AGAINST FOREIGN 
CITIZENS THAT MAY BE DIFFICULT 
TO GET INTO COURT IN SOME WAY 
OR ANOTHER. 
>> ONE OF THE REASONS I FOCUS 
ON THIS TODAY IS THERE IS AN 
EXCHANGE YOU HAD WITH ONE OF MY 
COLLEAGUES EARLIER TODAY ABOUT 
THE INDEFINITE DETENTION OF 
AMERICAN CITIZENS APPREHENDED 
ON U.S. SOIL.  
THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS 
SURROUNDING THIS,  SUGGESTING 
THAT THE EX PARTE JUSTIFY THIS. 
YOU DON'T NEED TO RESPOND TO 
THIS,  BUT I THINK IT IS A 
POINT THAT NEEDS TO BE 
MENTIONED.  
JUSTICE SCALIA MENTIONED IN HIS 
DECENT THAT EX PARTE CURRIN WAS 
NOT THIS COURT'S FINEST  HOUR.  
IN FACT,  WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE 
CASE WAS ARGUED,  IT WITH US 
DECIDED THE NEXT DAY,  THE 
SENATORS WERE TAKEN OUT AND 
EXECUTED THE NEXT WEEK,  THEN 
THE OPINION ITSELF WAS  ISSUED 
MANY MONTHS  LATER.  
SO,  AGAIN,  I AM NOT ASKING 
YOU TO PINE ON THE ON GOING 
VALIDITY OF EXPARTY CURRIN,  
BUT THE POINT IS YOU CERTAINLY 
AGREE THAT CONGRESS HAS THE 
AUTHORITY TO PROTECT LIBERTY,  
NOT  WITHSTANDING THE 
POSSIBILITY THAT THE SUPREME 
COURT MIGHT NOT STEP IN IN THE 
EX PARTE CASE? 
>> A COUPLE POINTS.  
JUSTICE CAN A LEAH,  OF COURSE 
-- SCALIA,  OF COURSE,  
DECENTED IN THAT CASE,  ALONG 
WITH JUSTICE STEPHENS,  ONE OF 
HIS MORE POWERFUL DECENTS ON 
INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY. 
 
THEY ARE RULING IT WAS AN 
IMPORTANT OPINION OF JUSTICE 
SCALIA'S,  ONE OF HIS MOST 
IMPORTANT OPINIONS AND A VERY 
POWERFUL OPINION.  
ON THE OPINION ITSELF,  IT 
DEALT WITH SOME,  MANY WHO WERE 
NOT AMERICAN CITIZENS,  BUT YOU 
ARE RIGHT,  THERE ARE AMERICAN  
THE COURT,  YOU ARE RIGHT,  
ALSO,  OF COURSE,  YOU STUDIED 
THIS AS MUCH AS ANYONE,  BUT 
THE COURT DID RESOLVE THE CASE 
VERY QUICKLY AND I SPENT MANY 
AN HOUR TRYING TO DECIPHER 
CERTAIN PARAGRAPHS OF THAT 
OPINION FOR CASES I HAVE HAD.  
IT IS NOT EASY.  
I WILL SAY THE COURT,  TO ITS 
CREDIT,  GET A LITTLE CREDIT,  
DID HAVE AN EIGHT OUR OR 
SOMETHING ORAL ARGUMENT WITH 
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE 
UNITED STATES ARGUING 
PERSONALLY.  
I READ THE TRANSCRIPT OF THAT 
TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS 
GOING ON THE OPINION THAT DID 
NOT UNLOCK THE BOX COMPLETELY 
FOR ME,  BUT YOUR POINT,  
JUSTICE SCALIA DID SAY IT WAS 
NOT THE COURT'S FINEST HOUR.  
IT WITH US A  RUSH.  
AND RUSH,  SOMETIMES THE COURT 
HAS TO RUSH,  BUT RUSH 
DECISIONS IN A JUDICIAL CONTEXT 
SOMETIMES AREN'T ALWAYS THE 
BEST. 
>> ON THAT POINT,  WOULD YOU BE 
OPEN TO THE IDEA OF BRINGING 
BACK THE ERA OF THE HOUR ORAL 
-- EIGHTY-OUR ORAL  ARGUMENT? 
>> THE EIGHT-HOUR ORAL 
ARGUMENT? 
WE DID HAVE ONE THAT WENT ALL 
AFTERNOON.  
AFTER WE GOT BACK TO THE 
CONFERENCE ROOM -- I DON'T 
THINK ANYONE WAS SAYING WE 
SHOULD DO THAT IN EVERY CASE. 
>> UNDERSTOOD.  
LET'S TALK JUDICIAL  
PHILOSOPHY.  
I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS FEDERAL 
78.  
IN FEDERAL 78,  HAMILTON 
DISCUSSES  THE DICHOTOMY 
BETWEEN WILL ON THE ONE HAND 
AND JUDGMENT ON THE OTHER.  
WILL BEING SOMETHING THAT IS 
EXERCISED BY THE POLITICAL 
BRANCHES,  PRIMARILY BY THE 
CONGRESSES,  THE LEGISLATIVE úB 
SOMETHING BE EXERCISED BY THE 
JUDICIAL BRAN.  
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE --  
BRANCH.  
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
THE TWO? 
>> THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IS 
DECIDING CASES AND 
CONTROVERSIES ACCORDING TO LAW. 
THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH IS 
MAKING THE POLICY,  EXERCISING 
THE WILL.  
THE JUDICIAL BRANCH CAN NEVER 
EXERCISE THE  POLICY-MAKING 
ROLE THAT IS RESERVED TO THE 
CONGRESS.  
ADMITTEDLY THAT IS SPEAKING TO 
THE LEVEL OF GENERALITY AND 
THERE ARE TOUGH CASES IN THE 
MARGINS.  
I AM ALWAYS TRYING TO FIGURE 
OUT WHAT THE LINE IS.  
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR EVERY 
JUDGE TO GO IN WITH THE MINESET 
I AM NOT THE POLICY-MAKER,  AND 
I AM THE LAW INTERPRETER,  LAW 
APPLY IN EVERY CASE.  
THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF 
THE FEDERALIST PAPERS WON INTO 
THE CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE OF 
ARTICLE 3,  THAT JUDGES I 
CERTAINLY HAVE TRIED FOR 12 
YEARS AS A JUDGE ON THE D.C. 
CIRCUIT,  TO INCORPORATE THAT 
BASIC FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE TO 
HOW I APPROACH EACH CASE.  
IT IS A VERY CRITICAL  BED-ROCK 
PRINCIPLE OF WHAT JUDGES DO IN 
OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTE 
>> WITHIN THAT  FRAMEWORK,  
WHEN WE  ENACT A LAW,  WHAT 
DETERMINES WHAT IT IS THAT YOU 
HAVE TO INTERPRET IT? 
IS IT WHAT WE SAY? 
OR IS IT WHAT WE SUBJECTIVELY 
INTENDED? 
>> IT IS WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE 
TEXT AND THE STATUTE,  SENATOR. 
JUSTICE KAY BEGAN SAID IT WELL 
IN A TALK TWO YEARS AGO,  MAYBE 
THREE,  I WAS IN THE AUDIENCE.  
SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT JUSTICE 
SCALIA,  BEES WHO OF COURSE 
BROUGHT ABOUT SIGNIFICANT -- SHE
CHANGE.  
ALL FEDERAL JUDGES PAY CLOSE 
ATTENTION TO THE TEXT OF THE 
STATUTE.  
THAT IS WHY SHE SAID WE ARE ALL 
TEXAS WALL NOW.  
KAGAN EXPLAINED EVERYBODY  
CARES ABOUT THE WORDS PASSED BY 
CONGRESS.  
I THINK ABOUT IT FROM A FORMAL 
AND FUNCTIONALIST PERSPECTIVE.  
AS A FORMAL MATTER THE LAW 
PASSED BY CONGRESS IS THE 
BINDING LAW AS IS WHAT IS 
SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT,  IT IS 
WHAT IS GOING THROUGH THE 
SENATE AND THE HOUSE.  
AND THAT IS THE LAW.  
BUT,  IT ALSO IS A PRACTICAL OR 
FUNCTIONAL MATTER.  
I THINK HAVING SEEN THE 
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS,  I KNOW 
HOW COMPROMISES COME TOGETHER 
IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE,  
WITHIN THE SENATE AND HOUSE.  
THERE IS NEGOTIATIONS LATE AT 
NIGHT OVER PRECISE WORDS AND 
COMPROMISES INEVITABLY.  
THE LEGISLATION IS COMPROMISED, 
THE CONSTITUTION IS 
COMPROMISED,  LEGISLATION IS 
COMPROMISED,  AND WHEN WE 
DEPART FROM THE WORDS SPECIFIED 
IN THE TEXT OF THE STATUTE,  WE 
ARE POTENTIALLY UPSETTING THE 
COMPROMISE THAT YOU ALL 
CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED IN THE 
LEGISLATIVE NEGOTIATIONS YOU 
MAY HAVE HAD WITH EACH  OTHER.  
THAT IS A DANGER I TRY TO POINT 
OUT WHEN WE ARE HAVING EARLY 
ARGUMENT IN A CASE OR -- ORAL 
ARGUMENT IN A CASE OR 
EXPLAINING CASES WHEN WE 
DEVIATE FROM WHAT CONGRESS 
WROTE,  WE ARE COMPROMISING 
EVEN AS WE COMPROMISE AS 
JUDGES,  THAT IS NOT REALLY OUR 
ROLE.  
IT IS IMPORTANT AS A FUNCTIONAL 
MATTER TO STICK TO THE TEXT.  
THERE ARE  INTERPRETATIONS 
WHICH OCCASIONALLY CAUSE A 
PRESUMPTION AGAINST THE LIKE 
THAT CAUSE YOU TO SUPER IMPOSE 
A PRESUMPTION ON THE TEXT,  BUT 
OTHERWISE STICKING TO WHAT YOU 
PASS IS VERY IMPORTANT. 
>> YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF A TEXT 
LIST,  AND IF YOU FOLLOW 
JUSTICE KAGAN'S STATEMENT,  WE 
ARE ALL TEXTUALISTS NOW. 
>> YES.  
PAYING ATTENTION TO THE TEXT OF 
THE STATUTE,  INFORMED BY THE 
CANNONS OF THE CONSTRUCTION,  
SUCH AS PRESUMPTIONS AGAINST 
REPLIED REPEALS,  THINGS LIKE 
THAT,  SOME OF THE CANNONS NOT 
JUST SETTLED WHICH IS A WHOLE 
SEPARATE HALF HOUR OF 
DISCUSSION.  
. 
>> JUSTICE KAGAN AT HER 
CONFIRMATION HEARING SAID WE 
ARE ALL ORE RIDGE INSTALLISTS 
NOW,  BY THAT SHE MEANT THE 
PRECISE TEXT OF THE 
CONSTITUTION MATTERS,  THE 
ORIGINAL MEETING,  PRECEDENT 
MATTERS,  AS WELL.  
ORIGINAL INTENT,  WHAT DID 
PEOPLE INTEND IS TEXT TO MEAN  
SUBJECTIVELY.  
THAT HAS FALLEN OUT OF THE 
ANALYSIS BECAUSE,  FOR EXAMPLE, 
LET'S TAKE THE 14th AMENDMENT 
EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE.  
IT SAYS RIGHT IN THE TEXT EQUAL 
THE SUPREME COURT SAID WHAT IS 
THAT BUT THE LAW SHALL BE THE 
SAME FOR THE BLACK AND THE 
WHITE.  
THAT IS BROWN VERSUS BOARD 
FOCUSING ON THE TEXT.  
BUT THERE WERE SOME RACEST 
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS INVOLVES 
THAT DIDN'T THING IT SHOULD 
APPLY IN THAT WAY TO CERTAIN 
ASPECTS OF THE PUBLIC LIFE.  
IF YOU ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO 
THE TEXT YOU DON'T TAKE ACCOUNT 
OF THE  INTENTIONS,  NOR IS IT 
PROPER AS A GENERAL PROPOSITION 
TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE  
SUBJECTIVE INTENTIONS.  
THEY CAN BE EVIDENCE IN CERTAIN 
CASES,  THE FIRST AMENDMENT,  
FOR EXAMPLE,  OF THE MEANING OF 
THE WORDS -- 
>> OF THE ORIGINAL PUBLIC 
MEETINGS? 
>> YES.  
OF THE ORIGINAL PUBLIC 
MEETINGS,  EVIDENCE OF THAT,  
BUT YOU DON'T FOLLOW THE 
INTENTIONS.  
AS I SAID REPEATEDLY,  YOU LOOK 
AT HISTORICAL,  THE HISTORY,  
THE TRADITION,  THE FEDERALIST 
37 TELLS US TO LOOK AT THE 
LIQUIDATION OF THE  MEETING BY 
HISTORICAL PRACTICE OVER TIME.  
THEN YOU LOOK AT PRECEDENT 
WOVEN INTO ARTICLE 3 AND 
FEDERALIST 78.  
START WITH THE  WORDS AS 
JUSTICE KAGAN SAID.  
WE ARE ALL ORIGINALISTS NOW IN 
THAT RESPECT OF PAYING AT LEAST 
SOME ATTENTION TO,  OR MORE 
THAN SOME,  PAYING ATTENTION TO 
THE WORDS OF THE CONSTITUTION. 
>> SO IF WE STIPULATE FOR OUR 
PURPOSES TODAY AS WE ARE HAVING 
THIS CONVERSATION TODAY,  
ORIGINALISM REFERS TO BASICALLY 
TEXT YOU RECALLISM WITH THE 
IDENTIFYING THE PUBLIC MEANING 
OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL TEXT 
ISSUE YOU ARE AN ORIGINALIST? 
>> THAT IS CORRECT AND AS 
JUSTICE KAGAN SAID,  THAT IS 
WHAT SHE MEANT,  WE ARE ALL 
ORIGINALISTS NOW.  
. 
>> WHAT WOULD ONE ARGUE AGAINST 
BEING A TEXTURALISM 
ORIGINALIST? 
>> WELL,  THERE ARE DIFFERENT 
PHILOSOPHIES OF WHAT A JUDGE 
DOES.  
BUT I THINK WHAT THE ROLE OF A 
JUDGE IS.  
BUT I THINK THE LAW -- ARTICLE 
6 OF THE CONSTITUTION SAYS THIS 
CONSTITUTION SHALL BE THE 
SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND.  
THE WORD LAW IS VERY IMPORTANT 
THERE.  
IT IS NOT A SET OF ASPIRATIONAL 
PRINCIPLES.  
IT IS LAW THAT CAN BE APPLIED 
IN COURT AND WHAT IS THE LAW? 
THE LAW OF THE WORD SO RATIFIED 
BY THE PEOPLE,  AND THEREFORE 
CAN BE APPLIED IN THE COURTS OF 
THE UNITED STATES.  
AND IT SAYS  THE SUPREME LAW -- 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN BY THAT? 
IT MEANS WHEN YOU PASS A 
STATUTE THAT IS INCONSISTENT 
WITH THE CONSTITUTION,  THE 
SUPREME LAW CONTROLS NAMELY THE 
CONSTITUTION CONTROLS OVER A 
COUNTRY STATUE AND THAT IS OF 
COURSE,  DISCUSSED IN FEDERAL 
78,  AS WELL,  OF WHAT IS THE 
SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND AND THE 
CONSTITUTION IS THE SUPREME 
LAW.  
AGAIN,  PRECEDENT,  HISTORICAL 
PRACTICE,  SUBSEQUENT TO THE 
PASSING OF THE TEXT.  
WE SEE THAT FOR EXAMPLE IN 
ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE CASES THE 
COURT WILL OVEN LOOK AT THE 
HISTORICAL PRACTICE AND 
PRECEDENT ROOTED IN ARTICLE 3,  
THOSE THINGS ALL GO INTO IT,  
BUT THE RECORDS,  THE ORIGINAL 
PUBLIC MEETING ARE AN IMPORTANT 
PART OF CONSTITUTIONAL 
INTERPRET AND HAS BEEN I THINK, 
THROUGHOUT. 
>> LET'S SUPPOSE CONGRESS IN 
ITS INFINITE WISDOM WITH IT'S 
APPROVAL RATE THAT  RANGES 
BETWEEN 9% AND 11% MAKING US 
SLIGHTLY LESS PROPER THAT ARE 
WALL,  WHAT IF WE DECIDE WE ARE 
ALL BUSY,  THERE ARE PARADES TO 
ATTEND,  THERE ARE POLITICAL 
RALLIES TO ORGANIZE,  THAT WE 
GET TIRED OF THE BUSY WORK OF 
MAKING LAWS AND WE DON'T WANT 
TO MAKE OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE 
FOR THE LAWS WE PASS.  
IT IS MUCH EASIER TO PASS A 
BROADER STATEMENT.  
WE SAY WE HEREBY PASS A LAW 
THAT SAYS WE IN THE UNITED 
STATES OF AMERICA SHALL HAVE 
GOOD LAW AND HERE BY DELEGATE 
TO WITH HERE WITH CREATED 
UNITED STATES COMMISSION ON THE 
ECONOMIC OF GOOD LAW,  THE 
POWER TO PROMULGATE,  INTERPRET 
AND ENFORCE GOOD LAWS IN THE 
UNITED STATES.  
WHAT CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES DO 
YOU SEE THERE? 
>> SENATOR,  THE CONGRESS IS OF 
COURSE ASSIGNED THE LEGISLATIVE 
POWER IN ARTICLE 1 OF THE 
CONSTITUTION,  SO IF IT 
DELEGATES WHOLESALE OF THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL POWER TO ANOTHER 
BODY,  THEN THAT NATURALLY  
POSES A QUESTION OF WHETHER THE 
BODY EXERCISING THAT POWER 
ULTIMATELY HAS IMPROPERLY 
EXERCISED THE LEGISLATIVE POWER 
AND WHETHER THAT RULE OR WHAT 
HAVE YOU THAT IS ENACTED BY 
THAT BODY IS LAWFUL BECAUSE IT 
WAS NOT ENACTED BY CONGRESS.  
SO,  THE FRAMERS  INTENDED THAT 
CONGRESS WOULD EBB ACT THE LAWS 
AND THAT THE EXECUTIVE WOULD 
ENFORCE THE LAWS AND THE 
JUDICIARY WOULD,  OF COURSE, 
RESOLVE CASES AND CONTROVERSIES 
ARISING UNDER THOSE  LAWS. 
>> AND YET IN SOME RESPECTS IT 
IS NOT THAT FAR REMOVED FROM 
SOME OF WHAT WE DO TODAY.  
WE MAY NOT PASS SOMETHIG AS 
EXTREME AS I  DESCRIBED IN MY 
HYPOTHETICAL BUT IN SOME CASES 
WE SAY WE HAVE GOOD LAW IN AREA 
X AND GIVE COMMISSION Y THE 
POWER TO MAKE AND ENFORCE GOOD 
LAWS  IN THAT AREA.  
SO,  AT SOME POINT AT WHICH WE 
CROSS A THRESHOLD OF 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL DELEGATION? 
>> WELL,  THE SUPREME COURT,  
AS YOU KNOW SENATOR,  HAS A  
NON-DELEGATION  PRINCIPLE.  
AT LEAST UNDER OUR CURRENT 
PRECEDENT IS ALLOWED THE 
DELEGATION -- AND I DON'T WANT 
TO GET TOO SPECIFIC HERE,  BUT 
IT IS ALLOWED SOME DELEGATION.  
SOME JUSTICES OR JUDGES WOULD 
SAY ACTUALLY WHEN THE EXECUTIVE 
ENACTS RULES PURSUANT TO THOSE 
DELEGATIONS,  THAT IS THE 
EXERCISE OF GIVE POWER,  BUT I 
THINK THERE HAS BEEN SOME  
PUSHBACK ON THAT.  
IN ANY EVENT THE SUPREME COURT 
HAS A DOCTRINE ON THE NON-
DELEGATION PRINCIPLE AND THE 
LINE IS DEBATED ON WHERE THAT 
SHOULD BE DRAWN,  BUT THERE IS 
PRECEDENT THAT DOES SUGGEST 
THAT AT SOME POINT CONGRESS CAN 
GO TOO FAR IN HOW MUCH POWER IT 
DELEGATES TO AN EXECUTIVE OR 
INDEPENDENT AGENC 
>> AND WHEN WE DO THAT AT SOME 
POINT WE ARE SHIRKING OUR OWN 
RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE WE ARE 
MAKING LAWMAKERS RATHER THAN 
LAWS AND CONSOLIDATING INTO ONE 
BODY THE POWER TO MAKE AND 
ENFORCE LAWS WHICH IS NOT ONLY 
SOMETHING THAT CAN LEAD TO  
TIERNEY,  THE VERY DEFINITION 
OF TIERNEY ITSELF.  
I WANT TO GET TO THE CAM ATTAIN 
FINANCE DISCUSSION YOU WERE 
HAVING A -- CAMPAIGN FINANCE 
DISCUSSION YOU WERE HAVING A 
FEW MINUTES AGO WITH SENATOR 
WHITEHOUSE.  
DIDN'T THE SUPREME COURT UPHOLD 
THE REQUIREMENTS AT ISSUE IN 
CITIZENS UNITED? 
>> IT DID.  
I BELIEVE THAT WAS AN 8-1 
MARGIN. 
>> IN FACT YOU HAVE WHEREIN ON 
THIS THAT THERE IS DISTINCTION 
FOR FIRST AMENDMENT  PURPOSES,  
CONSTITUTIONAL PURPOSES,  
BETWEEN LAWS MANDATING 
DISCLOSURE AND LAWS  BANNING 
THE DOING OR  SAYING OF 
SOMETHING,  ISN'T THAT RIGHT? 
>> THAT IS WHAT THE SUPREME 
COURT HAS SAID IN CERTAIN 
CONTEXT AND THAT IS THE LAW 
ASSET FORTH BY THE SUPREME 
COURT.  
THEY,  THE CITIZENS OF THE 
UNITED STATES,  IS A GOOD 
MILLION OF THAT,  SENATO 
>> YOU WROTE THAT DISCLOSURE 
REQUIREMENTS TRIGGER OUR RIGHTS 
THAT RECEIVE QUOTE LESS FIRST 
AMENDMENT PROTECTION CLOSE 
QUOTE THAN SPEECH PROHIBITIONS, 
OTHER TYPES OF SPEECH PRO HI 
BIGGSS. 
>> I THINK THAT FOLLOWED FROM 
THE SUPREME COURT LAW AND 
CONSISTENT,  I BELIEVE,  WITH 
SUBSEQUENT SUPREME COURT LAW 
WHICH ROLES.  
-- WHICH CONTROL 
>> DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE AMONG 
THE FEDERALIST PAPERS?
>> UM -- 
>> I AM NOT ASKING YOU TO 
CHOOSE BETWEEN ELIZA -- 
>> NO,  RIGHT! 
 I LIKE A LOT OF  
FEDERALIST PAPERS.  
FEDERAL 78,  OF COURSE,  THE 
INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY,  THE 
ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY.  
FEDERAL 69 WHICH SAYS  THE 
PRESIDENCY IS NOT A MONARCHY.  
VERY IMPORTANT WHEN HAMILTON 
EXPLAINS ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH 
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT A MONARCHY 
IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM.  
I THINK THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. 
FEDERALIST 10 WHICH TALKS ABOUT 
FACTIONS IN AMERICA.  
AND EXPLAINS THAT HAVING THE 
SEPARATION OF POWERS IN THE 
FEDERALISM  SYSTEM,  DIVIDING 
POWER IN SO MANY DIFFERENT  
WAYS WOULD HELP PREVENT A 
FACTION FROM GAINING CONTROL OF 
ALL THE POWER FOR THE PEOPLE OF 
THE UNITED STATES AND THAT 
MAKES IT FRUSTRATING AT TIMES 
BECAUSE IT IS HARD TO PASS NEW 
LEGISLATION,  BUT THAT ALSO,  
THAT DIVISION OF POWER,  HELPS 
PROTECT INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY.  
I THINK THAT COMES A BIT FROM  
FEDERALIST 10.  
FEDERALIST 37 AND 39 TALK 
ABOUT,  ON THE ONE HAND HOW WE 
ARE JUST TALKING LAWS THAT ARE 
THE CONSTITUTION OVER TIME CAN 
BE TERMED LIQUIDATED BY 
HISTORICAL PRACTICE.  
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 
THAT MEANS THAT AS THE BRANCHES 
FILL OUT THE MEANING OF THE 
CONSTITUTION OVER TIME WITH 
PRACTICES,  THOSE CAN BE 
RELEVANT IN HOW THE COURT  
SUBSEQUENTLY INTERPRETS CERTAIN 
PROVISIONS.  
WE TALK ALSO ABOUT THE NATIONAL 
AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS.  
THE COMBINATION THAT WE  HAVE,  
THIS ODD -- THAT IS THE GENIUS 
RIGHTS OF HAVING A NATIONAL 
GOVERNMENT PLUS STATE 
GOVERNMENTS AND WITHIN THE 
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT THE HOUSE 
IS  PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION 
AND THE SENATE IS STATE 
REPRESENTATION.  
THAT INTERESTING COMPROMISE 
WHICH MADISON,  BY THE WAY,  
WAS OPPOSED TO,  THE COMPROMISE 
AT THE CONVECTION.  
FEDERALIST 47,  THE 
ACCUMULATION OF ALL POWER IN 
ONE BODY IS THE VERY DEFINITION 
OF TIERNEY.  
I START MY SEPARATION OF POWERS 
CLASS EVERY YEAR WITH THAT 
EXACT QUOTE YOU READ YESTERDAY, 
BECAUSE THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. 
51,  IF MEN WERE ANGELS WE 
WOULD NOT NEED GOVERNMENT.  
SO, I AM SORRY,  I HAVE EIGHT  
KID 
>> IT IS BRILLIANT AND A 
GREATEST HITS LIST IF THESE 
WERE ON SPOTIFY AND YOU PUT 
TOGETHER A LIST OF THOS 
 LET'S CLOSE IN THE 
MINUTE-AND-A-HALF I HAVE LEFT,  
I GAVE MYSELF AN ADDITIONAL 30 
SECONDS BECAUSE OF THE TWO 
INTERRUPTIONS THERE.  
TELL ME HOW YOU WERE INFORMED 
BY FEDERALIST 51 AND HOW THAT 
RELATES TO YOUR ROLE AT A 
JURIST NOW IN THE D.C. CIRCUIT 
AND THE ROLE YOU WOULD PLAY IF 
YOU WERE  CONFIRMED  TO THE 
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT? 
THIS UNDERSTAND THAT GOVERNMENT 
IS AN EXERCISE IN  
UNDERSTANDING HUMAN NATURE.  
IF WE WERE ANGELS WE WOULD NOT 
NEED GOVERNMENT.  
IF WE HAD ACCESS OF ANGELS TO 
GOVERN OVER US WE WOULD NOT 
NEED ALL THESE CUMBERSOME RULES 
THAT MAKE GOVERNMENT SO 
INEFFICIENT AND FRUSTRATING.  
WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT AND HOW 
DOES THAT EFFECT YOU AS A JUDGE 
WHEN TRYING TO INTERPRET THE 
CONSTITUTION AND INTERPRET THE 
ACTS TAKEN PURSUANT THERE TO. 
>> THAT IS AN INTERESTING 
QUESTION,  SENATOR.  
I THINK WE RECOGNIZE WE ARE ALL 
IMPERFECT,  FIRST OF ALL ALL OF 
US AS HUMANS  ARE IMPERFECT 
THAT.  
INCLUDES JUDGES AND LEGISLATORS 
AND ALL OF US ARE IMPERFECT.  
SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT IN HOW WE 
GO ABOUT SETTING UP OUR 
GOVERNMENT.  
IF THERE WERE SOME PERFECT 
GROUP OF PEOPLE WE WOULD PUT 
ALL THE POWER IN THAT ONE BODY. 
BUT BECAUSE WE ARE IMPERFECT,  
PUTTING ALL THE POWER IN THAT 
ONE BODY WOULD BE,  THE 
DEFINITION OF TEARY.  
I THINK THE WAY WE DEAL WITH 
THE IMPERFECTION WHILE HAVING A 
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE ARE 
IMPERFECT,  DIVIDING AND 
SEPARATING THE  POWER,  TO MIND 
REENFORCES WHY THE FRAMERS,  
THE GENIUS DESPITE THE FLAWS IN 
THE CONSTITUTION AND THERE WERE 
FLAW,  THE GENIUS OF SEPARATING 
THE LEGISLATIVE EXECUTIVE,  
JUDICIAL POWER,  TILTING TOWARD 
LIBERTY IN ALL THOSE RESPECTS 
AND HAVING A FEDERAL SYSTEM 
WHERE WE STILL HAVE STATE 
GOVERNMENTS THAT CAN FURTHER 
PROTECT LIBERTY AND THE 
LABORATORIES OF DEMOCRACY,  AS 
WELL.  
I THINK ALL THAT IS BECAUSE WE 
ARE IMPERFECT AND BECAUSE WE 
RECOGNIZE THE IMPERFECTIONS.  
IT IS ALSO WHY WE HAVE THINGS 
LIKE A JURY SYSTEM AND EVEN 
WITHIN THE JUDICIARY WE DIDN'T 
TRUST A JUDGE TO TRIALS ON HIS 
OR HER OWN CRIMINAL TRIALS.  
OR CIVIL TRIALS.  
WE HAVE A JURY SYSTEM TO 
RECOGNIZE AND WE HAVE USUALLY 
12 AND THAT IS DESIGNED  TO 
RECOGNIZE THAT WE ARE IMPERFECT 
AND SOMETIMES THAT IS WHY WE 
HAVE GROUP DECISION-MAKING.  
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE 535 
LEGISLATURES AND 9 JUSTICES.  
WE DON'T USUALLY HAVE ONE 
PERSON.  
I THINK THAT ALL MAYBE STEMS 
FROM THE SAME PHILOSOPHICAL  
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE 
IMPERFECT BEINGS AND WE DIVIDE 
POWER AND MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE 
PERSON IN A JURY SITUATION OR 
OTHER SITUATIONS WERE OUR 
LIBERTY CAN BE EFFECTED IS 
EXERCISING TOTAL CONTROL.  
. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH,  JUDGE. 
MY TIME IS EXPIRED.  
I AM NOT THE CHAIRMAN OF THIS 
COMMITTEE,  
? AND THE HEARING JUST BROKE 
FOR RECESS. 
WE WILL HAVE MORE ON THIS AFTER 
A QUICK BREAK. 
BE RIGHT BACK.  
. 
>>> JACK DORSEY FACES HIS 
SECOND HEARING, APPEARING 
BEFORE THE HOUSE ENERGY AND 
COMMERCE COMMITTEE. 
THEY ARE HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF 
CENSORING CONSERVATIVE VOICES. 
>>  EIGHT TO TEN MILLION ACTS 
PER MONTH, IS THAT RIGHT? 
>>  PER WEEK. 
>>  PER WEEK. 
>>  TO STOP OVER A HALF MILLION 
ACCOUNTS EVERY DAY. 
>>  CAN TWITTER KEEP UP? 
>>   
. 
>>  IF THEY USE AUTOMATED ACTS 
DON'T THEY OVERWHELM TWITTER 
AND AFFECT YOUR FORMULA? 
>>  I MEAN IT'S DEFINITELY 
OTHERS HAVE DESCRIBED IT AS AN 
ARMS RACE BUT I BELIEVE IT'S 
VERY MUCH LIKE SECURITY. 
THERE IS NO PERFECT END POINT. 
WHEN YOU BUILD A LOCK SOMEONE 
ELSE WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO 
BREAK IT. 
YOU CAN'T TRY TO DESIGN FOR THE 
PERFECT LOCK. 
>>  CAN'T YOU IDENTITY THE BOTS 
AT LEAST AS THEY SIGN UP SO 
THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING 
THAT'S A FAKE AUTOMATED 
ACCOUNT? 
>>  IN CERTAIN CASES WE CAN. 
IT'S A GREAT POINT. 
ESPECIALLY THROUGH OUR API. 
THERE ARE MORE HIGH END WAYS OF 
AUTOMATION THAT ACTUALLY SCRIPT 
OUR SITE AND OUR APP THAT ARE 
MUCH HARDER TO DETECT. 
THEY ARE INTENDING TO LOOK LIKE 
HUMAN BEHAVIOR WITH THE 
SLOWNESS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR 
RATHER THAN THE SPEED THROUGH 
AN API. 
IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED. 
IT'S NOT A CHALLENGE WE ARE NOT 
INTENDING TO FACE. 
WE ARE TAKING IT HEAD ON. 
>>  YOU HAVE SOME CREATIVE 
MINDS, I WOULD THINK YOU CAN 
PUT ALL OF THOSE CREATIVE 
MINDS, ALL OF YOUR EXPERIENCE 
TO WORK TO DO THAT. 
I WANT TO ASK YOU A LITTLE 
ABOUT PRIVACY. 
TWITTER AND OTHER COMPANIES 
COLLECT INFORMATION ON USERS 
AND NONUSERS, OFTEN WITHOUT 
THEIR KNOWLEDGE. 
TWITTER'S BUSINESS MODEL IS 
BASED ON ADVERTISING AND YOU 
SERVE TARGETED ADVERTISING TO 
USERS BASS ON VAST AMOUNTS OF 
DATA THAT YOU COLLECT WHICH 
RAISES CONSUMER PRIVACY 
CONCERNS. 
YOU -- UP UNTIL LAST YEAR YOU 
-- THE PRIVACY POLICY INCLUDED 
A PROMISE TO SUPPORT DO NOT 
TRACK BUT THEN YOU CHANGED YOUR 
MIND. 
WHY? 
WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE UP TO 
CONSUMERS, WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE 
THE CONSUMERS CHOICE? 
>>  WE DO LET CONSUMERS TURN 
OFF TRACKING ACROSS THE WEB. 
>>  BUT THEY CANNOT -- ARE YOU 
STILL ABLE TO BUILD THE PROFILE 
ON EACH AND EVERY USER. 
ISN'T THAT CORRECT? 
>>  IF THEY LOG INTO THE 
ACCOUNT THEN YES AND WE LET 
THEM TURN THAT OFF. 
>>  I UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN WHEN 
THEY OPT OUT YOU ARE STILL 
COLLECTING DATA ON THEM. 
YOU ARE STILL TRACKING THEM. 
>>  I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THE 
CASE BUT HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP IT 
YOU. 
>>  LET'S DO THAT BECAUSE I'M 
OUT OF TIME. 
THANK YOU. 
>>  CHAIR RECOGNIZES THE 
CHAIRMAN OF THE REPUBLICAN 
CONFERENCE, FROM WASHINGTON 
STATE KATHY ROGERS FOR FOUR 
MINUTES. 
>>  THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN AND 
THANK YOU WHETHER DORSEY FOR 
JOINING US TODAY. 
I WANT TO START BY SAYING I 
THINK TWITTER IS AN IMPORTANT 
TOOL IN MODERN COMMUNICATIO 
AND IT'S WHY BACK IN 2011 I WAS 
SPEARHEADING AN EFFORT TO GET 
OUR MEMBERS SIGNED UP AND USING 
THIS TOOL. 
I THINK THAT IT'S A GREAT WAY 
TO INTERACT WITH THE PEOPLE WE 
REPRESENT AND SINCE THEN ITS 
BEEN AMAZING TO SEE THE GROWTH 
OF TWITTER AND THE TWITTER 
USERS ALL ACROSS AMERICA AND 
THE WORLD. 
IT'S WHY I THINK THIS HEARING 
IS SO TIMELY. 
THERE'S A LOT OF SERIOUS 
QUESTIONS THAT AMERICANS HAVE 
REGARDING TECH PLATFORMS AND 
THE ONES THEY ARE USING EVERY 
DAY AND THE ISSUES LIKE DATA
