IT IS A TIGHTKNIT COMMUNITY OF 
ABOUT 1500 OR SO RESIDENTS. 
THAT COMMUNITY HAS BEEN SORT OF 
GETTING TOGETHER TO TRY TO, 
THERE YOU SEE EXACTLY WHAT I 
WAS GOING TO REFERENCE, THAT 
THEY HAVE BEEN BANDING TOGETHER 
TO FAN OUT AND TRY TO FIND 
WHATEVER DETAILS AND 
INFORMATION THAT COULD. 
THERE WAS A MASSIVE SORT OF 
ORGANIZATIONAL CAMPAIGN THAT 
WAS CENTERED AROUND GETTING 
PEOPLE TO BE AWARE OF THE FACT 
THAT SHE WAS MISSING. 
AND NOW OF COURSE, THE SAD NEWS 
WHICH IS THAT CBS NEWS IS 
REPORTING THAT HER BODY HAS 
BEEN FOUND. 
CLEARLY, SO MANY ANSWERS, SO 
MANY QUESTIONS, AND NOT SO MANY 
ANSWERS. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER 
DISAPPEARANCE WHERE. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER DEMISE 
WORK, AND ADRIANA DIAZ HAD BEEN 
ON THE GROUND THERE FOR QUITE 
SOME TIME. 
WE WILL SPEAK WITH HER AND JUST 
A LITTLE BIT. 
THAT'S AT THE SAID NEWS COMING 
INTO THE NEWSROOM THAT MOLLIE 
TIBBETTS HAS BEEN FOUND DEAD. 
WE ARE STILL WAITING TO GET A 
HOLD OF HER TO TALK ABOUT THIS. 
THIS IS GOING TO BE, FOR 
CERTAIN, THE FAMILY IS GOING TO 
BE SHOCKED AND SADDENED. 
BUT THIS ENTIRE COMMUNITY THAT 
HAS BEEN GRIEVING ALONG WITH 
THE FAMILY OF MOLLIE TIBBETTS 
FOR THESE NEARLY 5 WEEKS. 
>> WENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
HAPPENS, THE PEOPLE CLOSE TO 
HER, UNDER SUSPICION. 
THERE WAS SOME TALK ABOUT HER 
BOYFRIEND. 
HE WAS OUT OF TOWN STAYING AT 
-- SHE WAS STAYING AT HIS 
APARTMENT. 
THERE WAS SOME STORY ABOUT A 
FARMER NEARBY THAT REFUSED A 
POLYGRAPH TEST. 
EVENTUALLY HE SAID THAT HE 
WOULD. úWHY POLICE HAD BEEN INI 
INTERESTED IN HIM, WE DON'T 
KNOW, IT COULD JUST BE THAT 
THEY WERE LOOKING AT EVERYONE 
WHO COULD HAVE POSSIBLY COME IN 
CONTACT WITH HER. 
BUT YOU ARE RIGHT, THIS HAS 
TRANSFORMED THIS TINY TOWN OF 
BROOKLYN. AND THEY WERE 
PROBABLY, MOST OF THE 
POPULATION WERE PROBABLY 
MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA AT THE 
HEIGHT OF THIS SEARCH. 
IT HAS CONFOUNDED PEOPLE. 
WHEN PEOPLE GO MISSING, IT'S A 
LARGE CITY. 
THERE ARE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS 
EVERYWHERE. 
OFTEN YOU CAN CATCH GLIMPSES OF 
THE PERSON, BUT BECAUSE OF THE 
NATURE OF THIS TOWN, AND FOR 
MANY REASONS, PROBABLY BECAUSE 
IT IS SMALL, THEY DIDN'T HAVE 
THE EVIDENCE TO GIVE THEM ANY 
SORT OF INDICATION AS TO WHERE 
SHE MAY HAVE GONE. 
IN FACT, HER PARENTS STARTED 
SPECTATING THAT MAYBE SHE 
RETURNED FROM HER JOG AND WAS 
ON THE COMPTER AND IT HAD COME 
BACK. 
BUT THEN THE POLICE SAID WE 
DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF OF THAT. 
AND THERE IS ALMOST A RUMOR 
MILL AT ONE POINT AS PEOPLE 
JUST SORT OF EAGER TO FIND 
ANSWERS. 
>> WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
SPEAK TO A FORMER FBI PROFILER. 
WE TALKED ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY 
THAT COULD BE USED IN 
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. RECALL 
THAT SHE WAS WEARING A FIT BIT 
WHEN SHE WENT ON THE JOG. 
SO WHEN FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS, 
THE FBI, SPECIFICALLY, GOT 
INVOLVED IN HER HIS APPEARANCE, 
THEY TRIED TO COMB THROUGH HER 
SOCIAL MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY 
THAT IS AVAILABLE TO 
INVESTIGATORS NOW IN 2018 THAT 
MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE 
FIVE OR SIX OR 10 YEARS AGO. 
TO TRY TO PINPOINT HER 
LOCATION. 
THE TRY TO PINPOINT WHERE SHE 
MAY HAVE BEEN AND WHAT 
HAPPENED. 
CLEARLY, THAT INVESTIGATION WAS 
STILL ONGOING WHEN WE LEARNED 
OF THE NEWS HERE THAT SHE HAD 
BEEN FOUND DEAD. 
THERE IS A LOT THAT WE DON'T 
KNOW THAT INVESTIGATORS KNOW. 
WE ARE STILL TRYING TO 
UNDERSTAND WHERE SHE WAS FOUND. 
WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION 
YET. 
SO ALL WE DO KNOW, ALL THAT HAS 
BEEN REPORTED RIGHT NOW IS THAT 
SHE HAS BEEN FOUND DEAD. 
BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS 
AND I'M SURE THE FAMILY DOES AS 
WELL. 
WE KNOW THAT THE FBI HAD BEEN 
INVOLVED IN HELPING LOCAL LAW 
ENFORCEMENT TO TRY TO LOCATE 
HER. 
>> WE WANT TO BRING IN OUR GO 
TO MEN WHEN IT COMES TO THESE 
SITUATIONS. 
CAN YOU HEAR US? 
>> Reporter: HELLO. 
I CAN. 
>> SO GLAD YOU ARE JOINING US. 
I KNOW THAT THIS IS A SITUATION 
WHERE THERE ARE CERTAINLY, NOT 
TO USE A CLICHC MORE QUESTIONS 
THAN ANSWERS, BUT THIS IS BEEN 
QUITE A MYSTERY. 
IT SEEMED LIKE SHE DISAPPEARED 
WITHOUT A TRACE. 
BUT AT THIS POINT, WE ARE 
LEARNING THAT A BODY HAS BEEN 
FOUND. 
WHERE DOES THE INVESTIGATION GO 
FROM HERE? 
I IMAGINE FINDING A BODY AS 
DISAPPOINTING AND HEARTBREAKING 
AS IT IS, IS A HUGE STEP FORWARD
TO FINDING THIS DOSE SOLVING 
THIS MYSTERY. 
>> IT VERY WELL COULD BE. 
FIRST, THEY ARE GOING TO 
EXAMINE THIS BODY FORENSICALLY 
TO TRY TO ESTABLISH A TIME OR 
DATE OF DEATH. 
THE MECHANISM, THE MEANS OF THE 
DEATH, THEY ARE GOING TO COMB 
OVER THE BODY IN GREAT DETAIL 
FOR SIGNS THAT INDICATED, SIGNS 
INDICATIVE OF A STRUGGLE FOR DNA
OF A POTENTIAL OFFENDER. 
ANY MINUTIA THAT MIGHT GIVE 
THEM A CLUE AS TO WHERE SHE HAS 
BEEN, HOW LONG SHE HAS BEEN 
THERE AND ANYONE WHO LINKS -- 
LINKS TO ANYONE WHO MAY HAVE HAD
A HAND IN HER DEATH. 
UNFORTUNATELY, WITH KIDNAPPINGS 
OF THIS NATURE, THE MORE TIME 
GOES BY, THE LESS LIKELY THAT 
YOU WILL HAVE A POSITIVE 
OUTCOME. 
AND HERE, THIS YOUNG LADY HAS 
BEEN MISSING FOR WEEKS. 
WE HAD SOME, I GUESS MAYBE 
HINTS FROM THE FATHER, THE 
BELIEF THAT SHE WAS STILL ALIVE 
AND WITH SOMEONE, PERHAPS 
SOMEONE SHE KNEW. 
THAT PERHAPS THERE WAS A 
RELATIONSHIP OF SOME SORT. 
A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT. 
BUT NOW WE COME TO THIS VERY 
TRAGIC AND -- END. AND WE HOPE 
LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN PUT THE 
PIECES TOGETHER AND FIND OUT 
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE. 
>> FOR THE -- FOR THOSE OF US 
THAT LIVE IN BIG METROPOLITAN 
CITIES, IT IS SOMETIMES 
DIFFICULT FOR THOSE TO 
UNDERSTAND THAT IN A CITY OF 
NINE OR 10 MILLION PEOPLE WHERE 
IT FEELS LIKE PEOPLE CAN 
DISAPPEAR EASILY, A LOT OF 
PEOPLE STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND 
HOW SOMEBODY IN A SMALL 
COMMUNITY, APPARENTLY THERE ARE 
ONLY ABOUT 1500 RESIDENTS OF 
THIS SMALL IOWA TOWN, COULD GO 
MISSING. 
AS AN FBI INVESTIGATOR, DOES 
THAT TELL YOU THAT THEY MAY 
HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM THIS 
COMMUNITY, OR COULD THEY JUST 
SORT OF BE IN PLAIN SIGHT, I 
DON'T MEAN IN PLAIN SIGHT, BUT 
IN THE SURROUNDING AREA, AND 
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS 
MUCH SMALLER, IT IS EASIER TO 
HIDE OR TO KIDNAP SOMEBODY AND 
KEEP THEM HIDDEN. 
>> WE HAVE SEEN EXAMPLES ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN KIDNAPPED OFF THE STREETS. 
AND THERE ARE WITNESSES, THAT 
THE UNBLINKING EYE OF A 
SECURITY CAMERA DOWN THE BLOCK, 
I'M TAKING BACK TO ONE A FEW 
YEARS AGO IN PHILADELPHIA WHERE 
A YOUNG LADY WAS KIDNAPPED OFF 
THE STREET AND THERE WAS A 
VIDEO DOWN THE STREET. 
AND FORTUNATELY, SHE WAS FOUND 
ALIVE WITH THE OFFENDER. 
I THINK IT WAS DOWN IN 
DELAWARE. 
AND SO YOU HAVE IN THAT URBAN 
ENVIRONMENT, A GREATER 
OPPORTUNITY, I THINK, FOR 
CAMERAS AND WITNESSES, FOR 
NEIGHBORS, FROM SOMEBODY JUST 
PASSING ON THE STREET TO SAY, I 
HAVE A DESCRIPTION. 
AND BY THE WAY, THEN THE POLICE 
CAN TRACK IT BACK POTENTIALLY 
TO A CAR OR A TICKET THAT WAS 
ISSUED NEARBY. 
IN THIS RURAL ENVIRONMENT, 
THERE IS A DIFFERENT SET OF 
CHALLENGES. 
TYPICALLY SPEAKING, THOSE 
CAMERAS ARE NOT IN PLACE. 
IT MAY BE RELATIVELY REMOTE. 
IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH IF SHE WERE 
JOGGING NEAR AN IOWA CORNFIELD, 
THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEONE TO 
DRIVE BY, POTENTIALLY BUMPER 
WITH A CAR, HIT HER AND INJURE 
HER IN SOME WAY AND PUT HER IN 
THE CAR AND TAKE HER AWAY, 
WITHOUT ANYBODY SEEING, WITHOUT 
ANYBODY HEARING, IT IS FRANKLY 
GREATER JUST BECAUSE OF THE 
LACK OF POPULATION DENSITY. 
THE LACK OF FOLKS NEARBY IN A 
WIDE-OPEN TERRITORY. 
SO IT PRESENTS LAW ENFORCEMENT 
WITH ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES. 
I AM SURE, THERE HAVE BEEN 
REPORTS OF THE FBI DEVOTING A 
COUPLE DOZEN AGENTS TO THIS. 
I'M SURE THEY HAVE. 
AND I'M SURE THEY HAVE GONE 
THROUGH ALL OF THE EXPECTED, 
KIND OF A CHECKLIST OF 
PROCEDURES LOOKING FOR WHO ARE 
THE SEXUAL PREDATORS WHO ARE 
REGISTERED IN THE AREA. 
WHO ELSE IS IN THE AREA? 
WHO HAS SHOWN AN INTEREST IN 
THE YOUNG LADY? 
WHO HAS SHE BEEN COMMUNICATING 
WITH? 
COULD IT HAVE BEEN SOME WOULD 
BE PARAMORE FROM HER PAST THAT 
POPPED BACK UP THAT HAS BEEN 
QUIETLY WATCHING THAT INTENDED 
HER HARM BECAUSE SHE REBUFFED 
HIM? 
ANY OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES, ANY 
OF THOSE POSSIBILITIES WILL BE 
LOOKED AT VIGOROUSLY BY LAW-
ENFORCEMENT. 
>> ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT GOT 
ATTENTION WAS THIS FARM THAT 
LIVED OUTSIDE OF THE TOWN, 
SEVERAL MILES, I DON'T KNOW HOW 
THE MEDIA GOT WIND OF HIM, BUT 
WE LEARNED THAT HE HAD BEEN 
QUESTIONED REPEATEDLY BY THE 
FBI WHICH CERTAINLY MADE HIM AN 
INTERESTING CHARACTER. 
AND THEN HE WAS PRETTY GUARDED 
ON TELEVISION, FIRST REFUSING 
TO DO A POLYGRAPH AND LATER ON, 
HE ADMITTED ON TELEVISION 
STATIONS THAT HE ACTUALLY DID 
DO THE POLYGRAPH TEST. 
I GUESS I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS. 
IF THE POLYGRAPH TESTS AREN'T 
ADMISSIBLE IN COURT, WHY WOULD 
THE FBI FIND THEM VALUABLE? 
>> I HAVE USED THAT TECHNIQUE 
IN MY CASES IN THE PAST, AND IN 
THE HANDS OF COMPETENT, CAPABLE 
POLYGRAPHER, YOU COULD COAX A 
CONFESSION. YOU COULD GET TIPS 
AND CLUES AND YOU COULD GET A 
CULPRIT LEVEL THAT WE ARE 
INTERVIEWING THE WRONG PERSON, 
OR YOU CAN GET SIGNS THAT TELL 
YOU THAT DESPITE DENIALS, THAT 
YOU ARE LOOKING AT EXACTLY THE 
RIGHT PERSON. 
I THINK LAW-ENFORCEMENT DOES IT 
VIEW IT AS A TOOL IN THE 
TOOLBOX, NOT NECESSARILY 
POSITIVE, BUT SOMETIMES IT CAN 
BE. 
IT CAN LEAD TO A CONFESSION. 
>> SHOULD AN INNOCENT PERSON 
AVOID DOING A POLYGRAPH TEST? 
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK SO. 
I THINK IN THE HANDS OF A 
COMPETENT EXAMINER, I HAVE BEEN 
POLYGRAPH IN MY OWN CAREER FOR 
SECURITY PURPOSES. 
AND YOUR APPREHENSION LEVEL, 
YOUR ANXIETY LEVEL DOES RATCHET 
UP AS YOU ARE PUTTING WIRES 
ACROSS YOU AND HOOKING YOU INTO 
THIS DEVICE TO PROBE WHETHER 
YOU ARE BEING TRUTHFUL. 
AND SO, A COMPETENT, CAPABLE 
POLYGRAPH EXAMINER UNDERSTANDS 
THOSE SIGNS, UNDERSTANDS IN THE 
PRETEST PROCEDURES HOW TO 
ACCOUNT FOR THOSE SIGNS THAT ARE
PURELY ANXIETY BECAUSE OF THE 
TEST WHICH IS COMMON, AND THAT 
WHICH LOOKS LIKE DECEPTION. 
AND SO I THINK IT IS A VERY 
VALUABLE TOOL FOR LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, BUT YOU CANNOT 
RELY ON IT SOLELY. 
IT IS NOT ADMISSIBLE IN COURT. 
HOWEVER IT CAN PROVIDE USEFUL 
CLUES TO SAY, WE ARE ON THE 
RIGHT PERSON, LET'S PUT ROUND-
THE-CLOCK SURVEILLANCE ON THIS 
PERSON. 
THEY ARE FAILING THE TEST. 
WE HAVE TO NARROW OUR FOCUS. 
WE HAVE TO GET ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION THAT MAY GIVE US 
PROBABLE CAUSE FOR A SEARCH OF 
THE PROPERTY. 
TO CONDUCT ADDITIONAL 
INVESTIGATIONS SURROUNDING ONE 
PERSON. 
OR TO POTENTIALLY SAY, LOOK, 
THIS IS THE WRONG PERSON. 
LET'S CROSS THEM OFF THE LIST 
AND CONCENTRATE EFFORTS 
SOMEWHERE ELSE. 
>> IN CASES SUCH AS THIS, IS IT 
TYPICALLY CONVENTIONAL WISDOM, 
AND THAT CONVENTIONAL WISDOM 
THAT IS PROVEN BY INVESTIGATIONS
THAT THE FBI HAS CONDUCTED, 
THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE KIDNAPPED 
ARE GENERALLY KIDNAPPED BY 
SOMEONE THAT THEY KNOW OR 
SOMEONE THAT THEY ARE CONNECTED 
TO SOMEHOW? 
THAT THESE THINGS ARE NOT 
GENERALLY RANDOM, OR AM I 
WRONG? 
>> REALLY, THE VERY SMALL 
MINORITY OF ACTUAL STRANGER 
ABDUCTIONS IN THE COUNTRY, THAT 
IS THE SMALL MINORITY. 
THEN YOU EXPAND OUT FROM THAT, 
AND YOU LOOK AT THE KIDNAPPINGS 
THAT ARE CONDUCTED BY A PARENT, 
BECAUSE THERE IS A DIVORCE 
PENDING, THERE IS A SEPARATION 
PENDING, AND SO YOU HAVE A 
PARENT TAKING THE CHILD WITHOUT 
THE COURT'S AUTHORITY. 
SOMETIMES THE FOREIGN 
COUNTRIES. 
YOU HAVE FAMILIARITY WITH 
PEOPLE WHO ARE POTENTIAL 
OFFENDERS. THAT MAY BE A 
NEIGHBOR OR SOMEONE IN LINE OF 
SIGHT, SEXUAL PREDATOR WITH 
PRIOR CONTACT. 
BUT A -- THE TRUE STRANGER 
ABDUCTIONS, I THINK ARE VERY 
MUCH IN THE MINORITY AND REALLY 
ONLY A COUPLE DOZEN PER YEAR. 
>> SO FROM GOING FROM THAT 
BASIS, OUR PEOPLE WHO, YOU KNOW,
I AM TRYING TO THINK OF, I 
GUESS IF YOU KIDNAPPED SOMEONE, 
THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL DOESN'T, 
THEY'RE NOT A REPEAT OFFENDER, 
ONCE YOU KIDNAPPED SOMEONE, IF 
THEY CATCH YOU, YOU GO TO JAIL 
FOR A LONG TIME. 
BUT I'M WONDERING, I'M TRYING 
TO UNDERSTAND HOW IN A SMALL 
COMMUNITY, SOMEONE COULD ALL OF 
A SUDDEN DECIDE TO DO SOMETHING 
IF WE ASSUME THAT PERHAPS SHE 
WAS CONNECTED TO WHOEVER THE 
KIDNAPPER WAS. 
>> YOU DON'T JUST START WITH 
KIDNAPPING, THERE MUST'VE BEEN 
SOMETHING ELSE? 
>> AS ALWAYS, SHE GETS WHAT I'M 
TRYING TO SAY. 
 
>> I THINK THERE IS SOME TRUTH 
TO THAT, USUALLY THERE IS 
ANOTHER STARTING POINT. 
THAT IS WHY THE FBI, LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OUT THERE ARE GOING 
TO BE LOOKING AT PRIOR 
REGISTERED SEXUAL OFFENDERS. 
SOMEONE WHO HAS A KIDNAPPING, 
FOR NEFARIOUS PURPOSES, IN THE 
PAST, CONVICTED FELONS, 
RELEASED IN THAT AREA, LIVING 
IN THE GENERAL AREA, PASSING 
THROUGH THE AREA. 
BUT YOU ARE GENERALLY LOOKING 
FOR SOMEBODY WHO HAS THIS KIND 
OF DNA. THEY HAVE SHARED A 
PROPENSITY TO DO BAD THINGS IN 
THE PAST. 
THERE IS A LIKELIHOOD THEY WILL 
DO IT AGAIN. 
BUT I THINK THERE IS ALSO THE 
OPPORTUNITY THAT LAW 
ENFORCEMENT CANNOT IGNORE THAT 
THIS IS A ONE-OFF OFFENDER, 
SOMEONE WHO HAS SHOWN AN 
INTEREST IN HER, ALTHOUGH 
PERHAPS CONCEALED, AND INTEREST 
IN HER IN THE PAST. 
OR AN INTEREST IN YOUNG LADIES 
THAT FIT A SIMILAR DESCRIPTION. 
AND THEY ARE SITTING OUT THERE 
BECAUSE SO MUCH BAD IS 
AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET NOW. 
YOU CAN SEARCH AND SEE ANY 
HORRIBLE THING YOU WANT TO 
SEARCH AND SEE. 
AND I THINK THAT IS, IT GIVES 
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOMEONE WHO 
IS A NOVICE, WHO IS NEW TO THIS 
SORT OF THING, IT GIVES THEM 
POTENTIAL INSPIRATION, THAT 
THEY HAD BEEN LOOKING AT IT ON 
THE INTERNET, AND SUDDENLY, 
THEY DECIDE, HEY, I'M GOING TO 
DO THIS. 
I'M GOING TO ACT ON MY 
IMPULSE. 
I AM TIRED OF SEEING IT. 
I AM GOING TO LIVE IT. 
AND SO, THAT IS THE JOB OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT TO TRY TO FIGURE 
OUT, OKAY, FIRST, WHAT IS THE 
VICTIM BALAJI? 
WHAT DO THEY KNOW ABOUT MOLLIE 
TIBBETTS'S HABITS? WHO SHE 
ASSOCIATES WITH, WHO IS IN THE 
SOCIAL CIRCLE AND WHO TRIED TO 
GET TO BE PART OF A SOCIAL 
CIRCLE WITH HER, ANYONE 
REBUFFED, TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE 
VICTIM AND THEN WORK TOWARD WHO 
IS A POTENTIAL OFFENDER, BASED 
ON HER PATTERN OF LIFE, WHO 
WOULD BE INTERSECTING THE 
PERSON? 
INTERSECTING WITH HER, LOOKING 
TO POTENTIALLY DO HER HARM? 
AND IF SO, I AM SURE THAT THE 
FBI AND THE BEHAVIORAL LIST IN 
QUANTICO, THEY ARE PITCHING IN. 
THEY ARE LOOKING OVER THE 
INFORMATION AND TRYING TO 
DEVELOP A POTENTIAL OFFENDER 
PROFILE IF THEY DO NOT HAVE A 
LOGICAL SUSPECT ALREADY IN MIND.
>> I AM LOOKING AT THIS VIDEO 
OF THE SEARCH, AND THESE ARE 
LONG COUNTRY ROADS. 
THERE ARE NO SIDEWALKS. 
AND IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME THAT 
PERHAPS AN ACCIDENT IS A 
POSSIBILITY. 
IF SHE WAS OUT AND RUNNING, SHE 
COULD'VE BEEN HIT BY A CAR. 
IS THAT SOMETHING TO 
CONTEMPLATE? 
>> I THINK IN THE EARLY DAYS, 
THAT CERTAINLY WOULD BE A 
POSSIBILITY, BECAUSE COULD BE 
THAT THIS WAS A DISTRACTED 
DRIVER? 
HEY BUMPED HER ON A COU 
ROAD BECAUSE THEY WERE TEXTING 
OR DISTRACTED AND THEY BUMPED 
HER AND SHE WAS SERIOUSLY HURT, 
AND THEY FLED THE SCENE 
THINKING, WHAT DID I JUST DO, 
HIDDEN RUNS ARE COMMON. 
THEY OCCUR IN EVERY CITY OF OUR 
COUNTRY PROBABLY ON A DAILY 
BASIS. 
SO COULD IT HAVE BEEN THAT SORT 
OF INCIDENT? 
AND SHE JUST WASN'T DISCOVERED 
IN TIME? 
WE WILL FIND THAT OUT. 
WAS THIS AN INJURY FROM BEING 
STRUCK BY A VEHICLE AND SHE WAS 
LEFT IN A SERIOUSLY INJURED 
CONDITION AND DIED OF EXPOSURE? 
WHAT IS THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE? 
DOES IT TAKE US TO THAT SORT OF 
CONCLUSION? 
HOW CLOSE TO A ROADWAY WAS SHE 
FOUND? WAS SHE PUT IN SOME MORE 
REMOTE PLACE? 
I AM THINKING BACK TO A DEATH 
DOWN HERE IN THE 
CHARLOTTESVILLE AREA. 
AGAIN, A FEW YEARS AGO IN THE 
FBI. 
UNFORTUNATELY, LAW ENFORCEMENT 
LOCATED THE VICTIM BECAUSE OF 
VULTURES FLYING IN A PARTICULAR 
AREA. 
THE SMELL OF A DECAYING BODY, 
AND THAT HELPED LAW ENFORCEMENT 
LOCATE THE VICTIM. 
IT IS TRAGIC AND UNFORTUNATE. 
IN THAT CASE, IT WAS A 
HOMICIDE. 
IT WAS AN INTENDED ACT. 
LAW-ENFORCEMENT BY THE HUNDREDS 
WERE SEARCHING WITH THE 
COMMUNITY. 
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A TRAGIC END.
>> WE ARE JUST FLASHING ON THE 
SCREENS THAT THE POLICE ARE 
EXPECTED TO GIVE AN UPDATE ON 
THE CASE. 
THAT WON'T BE UNTIL ABOUT 6 PM 
EASTERN TIME. 
THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE A LOT 
OF QUESTIONS ASKED OF THE 
POLICE AND OTHER OFFICIALS. 
I GUESS, THE ONE THING THAT YOU 
HAVE BEEN POINTING OUT IS THE 
ABILITY OF SOMEBODY TO DO 
SOMETHING NEFARIOUS BECAUSE OF 
THE LACK OF SECURITY CAMERAS 
AND EYEWITNESSES. AND I SORT OF 
FEEL LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING 
THAT IS GOING TO HAVE THIS 
COMMUNITY. 
WHAT IS A COMMUNITY LIKE 
BROOKLYN, IOWA, WHAT DO THEY DO 
IN THE WAKE OF SOMETHING LIKE 
THIS? 
AND I WONDER IF THERE IS A LOT 
THEY CAN DO. IS IT JUST ONE OF 
THOSE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN 
THIS SMALL TOWN, BUT I CAN JUST 
IMAGINE A TOWN OF 1500 PEOPLE 
WERE EVERYBODY KNOWS EACH 
OTHER, THIS IS GOING TO BE 
EXTREMELY SHOCKING AND 
DEBILITATING. 
>> I WOULD THINK IF THE POLICE 
CONCLUDE RELATIVELY QUICKLY 
THAT THIS WAS A HOMICIDE, THAT 
WILL, THAT IS KIND OF SHOCKING 
FOR A SMALL COMMUNITY WHERE 
THEY DON'T HAVE HOMICIDES. 
I LIVE OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON 
DC. 
I SEE THE NIGHTLY NEWS. 
HERE IN CHICAGO, YOU HAVE 
HOMICIDES THAT OCCUR IN ALMOST 
A DAILY BASIS, SOMETIMES 
MULTIPLE OVER THE WEEKEND. 
THINK OF CHICAGO IN RECENT 
WEEKENDS. 
THE COMMUNITY IS ALMOST NUMB TO 
IT, ALTHOUGH VERY OFTEN 
OUTRAGED. 
BUT WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 
A VERY SMALL RURAL COMMUNITY 
WHERE YOU HAVE NOT PERHAPS HAD 
A HOMICIDE IN YEARS, YOU THINK 
IN TERMS OF NEIGHBORS LOOKING 
AT NEIGHBORS SAYING, WHO DID 
THIS? 
WHO IS WALKING AMONG US THAT IS 
RESPONSIBLE? 
I AM SURE IT IS STUNNING IF IT 
TURNS OUT THAT WAY. IF IT TURNS 
OUT IT WAS A KIDNAPPING, FIRST, 
AND FOLLOWED BY A MURDER, IT IS 
STUNNING TO A SMALL COMMUNITY 
LIKE THIS. 
>> DO YOU FIND THAT, AND YOU 
STRESSED THAT IF IT TURNS OUT 
THAT WAY, WE REALLY DON'T KNOW, 
BUT DO YOU FIND THAT WHEN THERE 
ARE MURDERS LIKE THIS IN SUCH A 
SMALL COMMUNITY, SOMEONE KNOWS 
SOMETHING? 
BEYOND THE PERPETRATOR, SOMEONE 
ELSE HAS SEEN SOMETHING AND 
KIND OF TUCKED IT AWAY AND IS 
NOT SURE IF THEY SHOULD COME 
FORWARD, BUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF 
THIS SORT OF BEING A COMPLETE 
SECRET KEPT BETWEEN THE 
PERPETRATOR AND THE VICTIM IS 
PROBABLY PRETTY LOW? 
>> THERE IS VERY OFTEN, WITH 
THIS, AND I KNOW WE HAVE TALKED 
ABOUT IT WITH ISIS INSPIRED 
ATTACKS, A LEAKAGE OF THE SIGNS 
OF SOMEBODY WHO HAS THIS SORT 
OF INTENT. 
WHAT LAW-ENFORCEMENT WILL BE 
TRYING TO DO IS KEEP THIS CASE 
ALIVE IN THE MEMORIES OF 
MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, 
BECAUSE VERY OFTEN, SOMEONE SAW 
A SIGN. 
WHETHER IT IS SUBTLE OR BIG AND 
UGLY, SOMEONE SAW SOMETHING AND 
LAW-ENFORCEMENT IS DESPERATE TO 
GET THAT ONE TIP THAT CRACKS 
THIS CASE OPEN. 
WE WANT PEOPLE WHO MAY BE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR A KIDNAPPING 
LET ALONE A KIDNAPPING AND 
MURDER OFF THE STREETS OF 
AMERICA. SO LAW-ENFORCEMENT IS 
GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY BE VERY 
OFTEN AS DAYS AND WEEKS GO 
PAST, BE CREATIVE IN TRYING TO 
KEEP THIS IN THE PUBLIC EYE, 
BECAUSE THE PUBLIC CAN BE SO 
VALUABLE IN THESE CASES. 
LAW-ENFORCEMENT, ALONE, IS NOT 
THE ANSWER TO ALL OF THE 
CHALLENGES ABOUT CRIME. 
WE NEED THE PUBLIC AND MEDIA TO 
HELP GET THE WORD OUT. 
AND TO ENERGIZE THE PUBLIC AND 
HAVE THAT ONE PERSON WHO KNOWS 
SOMETHING COME ACROSS, PICK UP 
THE PHONE, CALL THE POLICE. 
AND GIVE A CLUE, A LEAD, AND 
HAVE THE POLICE START TO DO 
THEIR WORK. 
AND NARROW DOWN AND FOCUS AND 
POTENTIALLY GET A SEARCH 
WARRANT. 
AND GO AND TAKE AN OFFENDER OFF 
THE STREETS. 
>> $400,000 HAD BEEN RAISED, 
MONEY TO HELP FIND HER, NOW THE 
MONEY WILL GO TO ANYONE WHO CAN 
HELP GIVE INFORMATION LEADING 
TO THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE. 
HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T NEED MONEY 
TO MOTIVATE YOU, BUT IF THAT IS 
WHAT IT TAKES, THERE IS A LOT 
OF MONEY OUT THERE. 
JUST TO CLARIFY HOW SOME OF 
THIS INFORMATION IS COMING TO 
US NOW, WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS 
THAT CRIMESTOPPERS SAID THEY 
LEARNED OF THE DISCOVERY FROM A 
CLOSE FAMILY FRIEND OF MOLLIE 
TIBBETTS. 
THAT IS WHERE THIS INFORMATION 
IS LEAKED FROM, ESSENTIALLY, 
THAT A BODY WAS FOUND, AND IT 
LOOKS LIKE IT IS, INDEED, HER. 
>> STANDBY ONE SECOND. 
AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
EARLIER, WE SPOKE YESTERDAY TO 
A RETIRED FBI PROFILE -- 
PROFILER. WE ASKED WHAT THEY 
WERE LOOKING FOR WHEN IT COMES 
TO CLOSE. 
HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID. 
>> I THINK IT WILL BE VERY 
HELPFUL TO LOOK AT HER SOCIAL 
MEDIA AS WELL, PARTICULARLY IN 
THE HOURS AND DAYS BEFORE SHE 
WENT MISSING. 
SO THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT, 
úEV 
BEHAVIOR, HOW SHE COMES ACROSS, 
HER STATE OF MIND, DOES SHE 
SEEM DEPRESSED? 
DOES SHE SEEM DISTANT? 
THEY WILL LOOK AT WHO WAS SHE 
WITH? 
WHO WAS IN THE BACKGROUND? 
WHO WAS AWARE OF THE LAST 
VIDEOS THAT SHE POSTED? 
THAT WILL BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL 
TO INVESTIGATORS, AGAIN, AS 
THEY TRY TO RECONCILE WHO WAS 
THE MOLLY -- MOLLIE TIBBETTS ON 
SOCIAL MEDIA VERSUS BEHIND 
CLOSED DOORS, AND WHO ARE THE 
PEOPLE, IF ANY, THAT SHE IS 
AFRAID OF. 
SO WHAT YOU SEE ON SOCIAL MEDIA 
BEAUTIFUL FACES, BUT DOES THAT 
REALLY REFLECT WHAT IS GOING ON 
IN HER PERSONAL LIFE? 
IT IS HELPFUL AND IT IS GOOD 
WHEN THEY ARE RECONCILING THAT 
TO SEE WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON IN 
HER LIFE. 
>> WHEN WE PLAYED THAT BACK, 
ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS STRUCK 
BY, BEFORE SHE WRAPPED UP HER 
COMMENTS, WHO MOLLY MAY BE 
AFRAID OF, THAT IS SOMETHING 
THAT I DON'T THINK WE TAKE INTO 
ACCOUNT WHEN WE LOOK AT 
SOMEONE'S SOCIAL MEDIA, A 
GENERALLY SHOWS THE WORLD HOW 
WE WANT THEM TO PERCEIVE US, 
WHICH IS GENERALLY HAPPY AND 
ENJOYING OUR LIVES. 
THE IDEA THAT YOU MAY BE AFRAID 
OF SOMEONE WHETHER IT IS AT 
SCHOOL OR IN THE COMMUNITY AND 
THAT IT MAY -- YOU MAY NOT BE 
WILLING TO SHARE THAT 
INFORMATION EXCEPT WITH CLOSE 
CONFIDENCE, THAT IS SOMETHING 
THAT COULD BE A THREAT THAT 
INVESTIGATORS ARE LOOKING AT 
AND WE IN THE PUBLIC MAY NOT BE 
AWARE OF IT. 
>> NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. 
I MENTIONED EARLIER, VICTIM 
KNOWLEDGE HE, THAT IS WHAT MARY 
ELLEN IS DESCRIBING. 
WHAT DOES LAW-ENFORCEMENT KNOW 
ABOUT HER PATTERN OF LIFE? 
WHO ON HER SOCIAL MEDIA, YOU 
ARE EXACTLY RIGHT. 
WE PRESENT VERY OFTEN ON SOCIAL 
MEDIA THAT WHICH WE WANT TO 
PRESENT, AND WE CONCEAL THAT 
WHICH WE WANT TO CONCEAL. 
WHO WAS SHE BLOCKING FROM 
SOCIAL MEDIA? 
WHOSE PHONE CALLS WAS SHE 
BLOCKING? 
WHAT ARE HER CLOSEST FRIENDS 
SAYING ABOUT WOULD BE 
PARAMORE'S WHO REPEATEDLY OR 
INSISTENTLY ASKED HER ON A DATE 
AND IGNORE THE FACT THAT SHE 
HAD A BOYFRIEND, WHATEVER? 
THAT OTHER PART THAT IS OFTEN 
UNSEEN, IT IS LAW-ENFORCEMENT'S 
JOB TO PROBE INTO THAT AS WELL. 
>> WHAT ABOUT THE VALUE OF 
SOCIAL MEDIA WHEN IT COMES TO 
THIS INVESTIGATION? 
>> I THINK THERE IS VALUE, 
BECAUSE IT WILL GIVE US SOME 
INDICATORS OF HER STATE OF MIND.
BEFORE THIS, WEEKS BEFORE, WHAT 
HAS BEEN GOING ON IN HER LIFE 
VERY OFTEN, PEOPLE POST THAT UP.
IT IS A PART OF THE ENTIRE 
MATRIX OF UNDERSTANDING, WHAT 
IS THIS PERSON ABOUT, WHAT 
MOTIVATED HER? WHAT DID HER 
LIFE LOOK LIKE IN ITS TRUEST 
FORM? 
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LOVE 
WAS MEANT TO RECONSTRUCT PARTS 
OF THAT. 
WHAT HAS CHANGED ON SOCIAL 
MEDIA? 
OFTENTIMES, THAT IS VERY 
VALUABLE. 
OFTENTIMES YOU COULD PUT UP A 
PERSON IS IN A RELATIONSHIP, 
BUT THEY ARE NOT, WHAT HAS 
CHANGED OVER TIME? 
THAT MAY GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
SOME INDICATORS, AND AGAIN, 
PATTERN OF LIFE. 
WHAT DID SHE DO, HOW DID SHE DO 
IT? 
WHO DID SHE NORMALLY INTERSECT 
WITH? THOSE ARE ALL THINGS 
WHERE YOU CIRCLE INVESTIGATORS 
AND INTERVIEW EVERYONE THERE. 
>> WHO WAS THERE THAT MAY HAVE 
LOOKED AT HER AND COME INTO 
CONTACT WITH HER? 
STARTED TO THINK BAD THINGS 
ABOUT HER? 
I WANT TO KNOW ALL OF THAT. 
I DON'T WANT TO JUST KNOW ABOUT 
GENERALLY AREA SEX OFFENDERS, 
BUT PEOPLE WITH CONVICTIONS FOR 
VIOLENT CRIMES, I WANT TO KNOW 
ABOUT WHO DID SHE INTERSECT WITH
. THAT MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN 
WHO IS IN THE AREA. 
>> THE NEWS IS THAT SHE WAS OUT 
FOR A JOG, AND OFTEN WE KEEP IT 
ROUTINE. 
>> WE MAY TAKE A RIDE OUT AT 8 
AM, OR AT 430, AND EVERY MEMBER 
SORT OF, AS A SECURITY LESSON, 
BEING OUT ALONE, BEING TOLD TO 
VARY YOUR SCHEDULES, BECAUSE AS 
SOMEONE KNOWS, IF THEY KNOW 
THEY WILL ALWAYS BE OUT AT 
6:30, THEY COULD BE WAITING FOR 
YOU. 
>> SAD BUT TRUE. 
I FIRST HEARD THE NEWS, I HAVE 
A YOUNG DAUGHTER, YOUNG ADULT 
NOW, BUT I AM JUST SHAKING MY 
HEAD THINKING FIRST, ISN'T IT 
WONDERFUL THAT SOMEBODY WHO IS 
IN A COUNTRY SETTING THE LEAVES 
IN THE HUMANITY OF THEIR FELLOW 
CITIZENS THAT THEY COULD GO OUT 
JOGGING AT NIGHT IN THE EVENING 
BY THEMSELVES IN A VERY REMOTE 
RURAL AREA AND FEEL SAFE. 
IT IS A WONDERFUL THOUGHT. 
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT IS NOT 
ALWAYS THE REALITY IN AMERICA 
WHERE YOU DO HAVE TOO MANY BAD 
PEOPLE. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE LISTS OF IN 
YOUR STATE, YOU CAN VERY OFTEN 
PULL UP YOUR COMMUNITY AND LOOK 
AT WHERE REGISTERED SEX 
OFFENDERS ARE ASSOCIATED, YOU 
CAN SEE THEM IN EVERY 
COMMUNITY. 
>> THAT IS PRETTY DISTURBING. 
THERE ARE APPS FOR THAT. 
>> THAT IS PRETTY DISTURBING. 
>> DON'T YOU THINK THAT THE 
PEOPLE IN SUCH A SMALL 
COMMUNITY, THEY WOULD BE AWARE. 
THEY REPORT THAT THE 
COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES ARE 
AWARE OF WHO IS LIVING IN THE 
COMMUNITY. 
>> IT MAY BE DIFFERENT AND 
DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. 
>> IT IS. 
AND IF YOU HAVE THE AWARENESS 
AND INCLINATION, YOU MAY BE 
ABLE TO GO TO A LOCAL WEBSITE 
AND FIND WHERE SUCH PEOPLE ARE 
IN YOUR COMMUNITY. 
VERY OFTEN, WE ARE WORRIED 
ABOUT OUR KIDS, DOES MY CHILD 
WALKED BY THIS LOCATION ON THE 
WAY TO THE SCHOOL BUS OR ON THE 
WAY TO SCHOOL? 
BUT THIS APPLIES TO ADULTS AS 
WELL. 
AND IN THIS DAY AND AGE WITH 
CRIME THAT SOMETIMES SEEMS TO 
SURROUND US, I WOULD BE VERY 
WORRIED. 
I'VE CAUTIONED MY OWN DAUGHTER, 
WHEN YOU GO SHOPPING, LOOK 
AROUND BEFORE YOU GET INTO YOUR 
CAR. 
SEE IF SOMEONE IS WALKING 
TOWARDS YOU BECAUSE OF A 
POTENTIAL CARJACKING OR 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS. 
THOSE FOLKS ARE OUT THERE. 
I'M NOT TRYING TO INSTILL A 
SENSE OF PARANOIA IN MY CHILD 
OR OTHERS, BUT CRIME IS A 
REALITY, AND WE OUGHT TO TAKE 
STEPS TO BE AWARE OF OUR 
SURROUNDINGS AND PROTECT 
OURSELVES AGAINST SOMETHING BAD 
HAPPENING. 
AND HERE, SOMETHING DID HAPPEN. 
THAT SOUNDS AS THOUGH SHE HAS 
BEEN FOUND DEAD. 
WE DON'T KNOW THE CAUSE YET. 
BUT SOMETHING BAD EVIDENTLY DID 
HAPPEN. 
WHETHER SHE WAS STRUCK OR 
KIDNAPPED AND KILLED, SOMETHING 
BAD HAPPENED TO THIS YOUNG 
LADY. 
IT IS HORRIBLE. 
>> YOU TALK, WOULDN'T YOU KNOW 
ABOUT IT IN A RURAL AREA, BUT 
WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 
THE PERPETRATOR. 
WE KEEP SAYING THAT. 
CERTAINLY THERE ARE REGISTERED 
SEX OFFENDERS EVERYWHERE AS RON 
POINTED OUT, BUT THERE ARE A 
LOT OF RESTRICTIONS ON THEM, 
THEY CANNOT LIVE CLOSE TO 
SCHOOLS OR PLAYGROUNDS, AND 
THIS AND THAT. 
YOU WOULD THINK THAT FURTHER 
OUT IN THE COUNTRY, IT WOULD 
GIVE THEM LESS OPPORTUNITIES TO 
VIOLATE THOSE RESTRICTIONS. 
THOUGH YOU MAY WANT TO THINK 
THAT PEOPLE DON'T LIVE OUT HERE 
WHO ARE UP TO NO GOOD, BUT THAT 
IS NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE. 
>> THE THING THAT I, HOW 
QUICKLY, RON, DO FEDERAL 
INVESTIGATORS, LOCAL POLICE, 
CLEAR FAMILY MEMBERS FROM, AND 
WE AREN'T POINTING FINGERS, BUT 
AS WE THINK ABOUT, WE HAVE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT PERHAPS SOMEONE 
SHE KNEW, SOMEONE THAT WASN'T A 
PART OF HER IMMEDIATE FAMILY. 
I AM THINKING THAT BY THIS POINT
FIVE WEEKS DOWN THE ROAD, CAN 
WE ASSUME, AND THIS IS AN 
ASSUMPTION AND SPECULATION, 
THAT THE FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE 
BEEN MORE OR LESS CLEARED? 
AND MY FOLLOW-UP QUESTION WOULD 
BE WHAT ABOUT COLLEGE STUDENTS 
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA? 
KIDS SHE MAY HAVE GONE TO 
SCHOOL WITH BUT DIDN'T LIVE IN 
THE TOWN? 
>> I THINK IT HAD BEEN REPORTED 
THAT HER FATHER AND HER BROTHERS
WERE CLEARED. 
HER FATHER DOESN'T LIVE IN THE 
AREA AND HER BROTHERS WERE 
WORKING SEVEN MILES AWAY IN 
ANOTHER TOWN. 
BUT THAT IS THE INFORMATION WE 
ARE GETTING. 
RON, I'M SURE THAT YOU KNOW 
THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HOLDS BACK 
INFORMATIO FROM THE MEDIA. 
>> THEY DO. 
AND THERE WAS ALSO REPORTING 
THAT THE BOYFRIEND, WHO I THINK 
WAS A PART OF THE INITIAL 
MISSING REPORT WAS CLEARED AS 
WELL. 
SO IS THAT TRUE? 
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT LAW 
ENFORCEMENT WATTS PEOPLE TO 
BELIEVE? 
LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS A REASON TO 
BE GUARDED ABOUT WHAT THEY SAY 
AND WHAT THEY DO. 
THEY ARE CERTAINLY LOOKING AT 
THOSE IN CLOSEST PROXIMITY. 
IS THERE A FAMILY CONNECTION 
HERE? 
WHAT DOES THE FAMILY LIFE LOOK 
LIKE 
>> IT JUST STRUCK ME THAT WITH 
THE DISCOVERY OF HER BODY, NOW 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOME 
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT 
INVESTIGATORS ARE GOING TO HAVE 
ACCESS TO, DNA AND OTHER TYPES 
OF EVIDENCE THAT, TO ME, IT 
WOULD CLEARLY SUPERSEDE 
ANYTHING THAT YOU COULD FIND ON 
SOCIAL MEDIA THAT YOU HAVEN'T 
FOUND OVER THE LAST FIVE WEEKS. 
THINGS WE MAY HAVE ASSUMED 
PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN CLEARED 
MAY ALL OF A SUDDEN FALL BACK 
INTO SUSPICION BECAUSE OF THE 
DISCOVERY OF THE BODY? 
>> THAT IS TRUE. 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK 
ABOUT THE FIT BIT AND HER 
PHONE, ARE THEY DISCOVERED ON 
HER? 
AND WHAT DOES THE SEARCH OF 
THOSE DEVICES YIELD? 
DOES THE LOCATION OF HER BODY 
TAKE THE POLICE TO YET ANOTHER 
LOCATION? 
WE ARE NOW IN THE VERY EARLY 
STAGES OF A DEATH 
INVESTIGATION. 
I THINK THERE IS MUCH TO BE 
LEARNED FROM THE CONDITION OF 
HER BODY AS WELL AS THE 
LOCATION HERE, HOW FAR FROM 
WHERE SHE WAS REPORTEDLY 
JOGGING, HOW FAR FROM HER HOME, 
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE? 
AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE 
SOME MORE DETAIL ON THAT WITHIN 
THE NEXT 6 TO 12 HOURS. 
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR 
INSIGHT. 
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 
COVER THIS BREAKING NEWS. 
THE BODY OF MOLLIE TIBBETTS HAS 
BEEN DISCOVERED. 
WE HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS 
WITHOUT ANSWERS. 
LATER ON, WE WILL TALK TO MARY 
ELLEN O'TOOLE, A FORMER FBI 
PROFILER. SHE IS FASCINATED 
WHEN IT COMES TO ANALYZING THE 
POTENTIAL PERPETRATORS IN A 
CASE LIKE THIS. 
WE WILL TALK TO HER LIMIT 
LATER. 
THERE IS MORE NEWS GOING ON AS 
WELL. 
WE WILL GET TO THAT. 
BEFORE THAT, WE TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
YOU ARE WATCHING CBSN , CBS 
NEWS, ALWAYS ON.
