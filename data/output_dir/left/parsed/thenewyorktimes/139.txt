I think I saw it first
shortly after it was put in,
and it took me a little
bit to connect it,
to think, “Well, what is that
and what holiday is this?”
I really had no
idea what it meant.
I didn’t feel it
was very attractive.
Later, I got a phone
call from someone
who said, “Did you notice
there’s a blue line in Warwick?
And is that a statement
about Black Lives Matter?”
So it made me wonder.
There were lines that were
painted in other communities.
And we started getting
phone calls, of course.
The village board felt that
it was an important thing,
because our police
force does a great job.
And it was very simple.
It’s going to eventually fade.
It was just a tip of the hat.
I first saw the blue
line showing of support
on the internet, and I
was touched when I saw it.
I didn’t expect it.
That blue line has been
interpreted in different ways
by different people.
There are many people,
good thinking people,
that were outraged.
And there are a lot of
good thinking people
who felt, well, this is a
way that we can say thanks
to our active police force.
Warwick is this town that
wants to be adorable,
wants to be this beautiful place
that people want to come to.
And all of a sudden,
we’ve got this ugly line
down the middle of the road.
The reason that I say that
it’s clearly Blue Lives Matter
is because of the
political context
in this country, the fact that
the Black Lives Matter movement
has been gaining some traction.
Why do we need to
suddenly stand up and say,
“We support our police”?
What was the intent
of the blue line?
To show appreciation for
law enforcement, local law
enforcement, without any of the
other things being dragged in.
I don’t think they were
looking beyond Warwick
when they did that.
And why?
Why did they have to?
(SINGING) Things I never
told you haunt and choke me
every day.
Want to give it
up and let it go.
Warwick is mostly white.
There’s not many times when
I see any minorities really around.
I personally have had
good and bad experiences
with the police.
More so when I was
a little younger,
I experienced a lot more run-ins
with the police.
Getting taken out
of the car for no reason.
It only has to go badly once.
That’s what comes to mind when
I saw the line, is that
I just felt like it was dismissive.
This is a problem.
Even my friends don’t generally
talk about issues of race,
what they’ve noticed, what’s
going on in the country, what’s
going on around them.
I think people are still 
very uncomfortable
about addressing race.
This is only a
manifestation of something
deeper in our
psyche around race.
And it’s there whether the
blue line surfaced or not.
“There is a national discussion
currently being had about this.
And from where we’re
standing, the blue line
takes a side in that argument.”
I decided to write a petition.
Not all of them, but
there are police officers
doing terrible things.
And we can’t just stand behind
any act committed by any police
officer simply because
they wear the uniform.
And that’s what I was
trying to draw attention to.
One of the comments
on my petition
actually sprung
another petition.
It was racially charged.
That was hard to see.
I don’t know what
will come of that.
I think most police officers,
the vast majority of them,
are trying to do a good job.
And we should stand by
them and honor them.
No.
Who put this out?
It says, “Black people
are killing each other,
so the police have
to do it, too."
That makes no sense to me.
See, the thing is, I could
not support the letter that
is for the blue line.
There are almost 600 supporters.
That horrifies me.
I didn’t think there were that
number of people in Warwick
who would support
a letter like this.
Oh, boy.
Get the blue line back.
That’s it.
This afternoon, we
made a determination
to take away the blue
line and to repaint
it the colors of our nation.
To change it was to
be more inclusive.
Excuse me.
If you can’t hold your
mouth, you can leave.
Mr. Mayor, I am ashamed
of what you did today.
Yeah!
You disrespected the Warwick
P.D. and all of the police
officers living here.
That wasn’t the intent.
That wasn’t —
Excuse me.
Don’t put words in my mouth.
If you don’t like it, you
can walk out those doors.
It can be corrected!
I wrote a letter in
opposition to the blue line.
All my cousins and uncles
are New York City policemen.
I am just like you.
Please, please.
Hey!
I’m kind of done with that!
I’m done with the rudeness!
Let the man speak!
We’re not against the police!
We have a context,
a national context,
where the Blue Lives Matter is
in opposition to Black Lives Matter.
You perceive it your way!
We perceive it our way!
We don’t agree!
Let’s have a quick
dose of truth here.
Let’s talk truth.
Police are being
assassinated in this country
at unprecedented rates.
This is due to a
lie that would have
us think that police
are hunting down
young minority males for sport.
Black Lives Matter
is built on this lie.
And the radicals’
objection to the blue line
was because it challenges
the Black Lives Matter lie.
Since January 1, there
have been almost 750
black-on-black
assassinations in Chicago.
But these deceitful
radicals want
to focus on the less
than 1% of instances
where a police officer engages
and kills one such often
armed and dangerous thug.
Mike Brown in
Ferguson, Missouri,
was a vicious thug engaged
in a violent assault.
This shows how these radicals
sit nice and comfortably
in Warwick and make lazy,
ill-informed condemnations
of our police.
You don’t get off
scot-free here.
It’s time to confront
you and shut you down.
You have incited a
war against our police.
“This kind of liberal.
This kind of radical."
What is that?
You’re talking to
your neighbors.
And so are black people!
— in Warwick, please.
Have any of you ever
felt threatened by a cop?
You said you felt that
that line was offensive
and that you felt
threatened by that line.
We’re coming together.
(NEWSCASTER) The Warwick community
now a village divided.
Tonight’s board meeting erupted
into shouting and anger.
Warwick is 91% white, home
to many in law enforcement.
For now, the line stays.
The controversy continues.
When you’re talking about an
issue like Black Lives Matter,
it’s unfortunate that people
can look at the name of it
and somehow think
that it’s offensive
when you’re literally just
saying that black lives … matter.
It seems like such a basic
thing that, unless you’re awful,
there’s no reason for you
to feel like it isn’t true.
People were saying
at the meeting
that, you know, 
“Black-on-black crime!”
It’s crime.
And when the particular
people they’re talking about
do kill other black
people, or whatever,
they go to jail for it.
I’m not a supporter
of Black Lives Matter.
I’m a supporter of
All Lives Matter.
My son is a New York
City police officer.
I never know, when he leaves, am
I ever going to see him again.
We were taught that if you
were told to stop by a police officer
you stopped.
In some of the instances,
where unfortunately people
were killed, they were
given a chance to comply.
They didn’t comply.
What did you think the
police were going to do?
A snippet of a cell phone
video of which you probably
don’t see the whole thing
from start to finish,
just the snippet,
should not be the end
of a police officer’s career.
You weren’t there.
You’ve had no training.
You don’t know what the police
officers are up against.
Don’t be an armchair cop.
Sometimes it just
feels like people
are being willfully obtuse.
There’s still this group
that doesn’t necessarily
get a fair shake,
because people were
willing to forego the
entire picture in order
to support this idea
of what the police are.
It’s just been a generally
pretty difficult time
for a lot of people, so I
think perceptions have changed.
And not just me, but
I feel like people
see each other differently.
My mom is very tied
to the police station.
They’ve known me since before
I could probably speak.
We have blue painter’s tape
across our car supporting police.
After leaving the
meeting and seeing —
just reflecting on
how the meeting went
and how it kept running in circles
and running in circles,
I was like, “That’s not … We can’t
approach it that way.”
The next day, that’s
when we decided
to go about it the
complete opposite way.
We wanted to present a
proper, more mature way
of going about
things, as opposed
to what some of the
other people were doing.
More civilized.
— Right.
The mayor, he’s
trying really hard
to sit down with people on
both sides of this issue
and figure out a way
to resolve things.
Unfortunately, there’s a
really loud and small group,
but very hostile.
There are people who support
the same things they support
in a very different way,
and I think that they
will get what they want.
We have been through
quite a week.
Definitely not the
Warwick community
that we’re so famous for.
There were a series
of meetings where
people disagreed, but then
also saw the common ground.
There was an
understanding that it’s
O.K. to reinstate the blue line.
But the question is, if there
is people in our community
that do have fears, that should
be part of that discussion.
I grew up in the
city of Newburgh,
which isn’t far from Warwick.
Growing up, seeing that
with the black community
treated themselves definitely
made me have a huge bias.
When all the Black Lives
Matter stuff was coming out,
I’m like, “Oh, wow, I
got no sympathy for you,
you guys are treating yourself
like animals. Look at you.”
Until this came about.
She was actually responsible for
really opening my eyes to it.
She’s like, “I have
a black family,
I was raised by a black family.”
And the Black Lives
Matter was started
by three people who are saying
that they weren’t being heard.
And they felt there
was injustices
in the criminal justice system.
Am I in the same camp
as Don and Nicole?
No.
But I don’t have
to feel as strongly
about the thing they’re
passionate about in order
to work with them on it.
As we move forward, we’re
going to continue to disagree.
But we have to realize
that we are all different,
and that conversation
has to continue.
There are going to
be people who say
that the line is
coming back, and that
still sends a terrible message.
And I hope that they see
that the problems that they
have with the police
that make them
have a problem with the line —
we’re trying to address those.
What we get out of it is
so much more than stripping
paint off the road.
We kind of wanted to
make community outreach
not the people
like me and him who
love the police, but
the people who are
a little bit afraid or unsure.
Apprehensive.
This is a program
that was developed
to help police and residents
build relationships.
It’s meant to take
place in small groups
of 10 to 12 people.
We have the dialogue started.
We have the ear
of the people who
are in charge of making those
sorts of changes possible.
And we have the attention of
people who didn’t even really
believe it was necessary.
We didn’t have that before.
We just had a line.
As a point of information,
just to be updated,
so … the line will be
allowed to fade away.
Then we transition
to the statue?
It’s basically going to be
a three-tier thing, where
etched on one side is
going to be the oath.
Then in the middle
is an etching,
the blue line .
So you’re going to bring the
blue line to the statute?
Yeah.
That’s our plan, yeah.
To me, the blue line is
a controversial issue,
and it will always remain
so, especially in Warwick.
The blue line literally
honors every fallen officer,
and it’s out of respect that
I want that blue line there.
If you choose not
to visit, you don’t
have to see the blue line.
Then the people who choose
to visit and actually support
our police —
Don, keep in mind that when
that whole crisis happened,
we could’ve dug in and said,
“No return to the blue line.”
We got controversy around
that from people I know.
We got some negative
stuff from that.
But we didn’t, and it
was an act of trust.
And I'm asking you
to remember that.
I think it’s still far
from being resolved.
The deeper conversations haven’t
really continued in a way
that they need to continue.
That concerns me.
There has to be more people
in our community a part
of that conversation,
because none of us
speak for the whole community.
I used to think that
Warwick as a whole
was generally more
forward thinking,
but I had my suspicions.
At least it feels like,
somewhat, concerns
are being heard.
I think we’re at a
crossroads right now.
We’re at a point where
we can accelerate
our forward
movement, but we also
could very likely slide back.
To be able to grow, you
have to be realistic.
You have to look at what’s still
lacking in the community, what
work still needs to be done.
I think that the line
will fade, and I don’t
think they’ll paint another.
And that’s fine.
But hopefully with that and
after this whole election
that’s been very divisive
to our country, hopefully
there will be healing.
And then lines won’t matter.
