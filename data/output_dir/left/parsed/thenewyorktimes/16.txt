“I’m Damien Chazelle.
I’m the director
of “First Man.”
In this scene is
Neil Armstrong
played by Ryan Gosling
with Janet Armstrong played
by Claire Foy sitting
down with their kids,
basically explaining
to them what’s
about to happen on
the eve of Neil’s
departure for the famous
mission to the moon.
And the idea for this
scene came from time
that Ryan and Josh
Singer the screenwriter
and I spent with Janet
and with Rick and Mark —
these two kids — of
course, now grown up —
recollecting this moment.
Janet had to convince Neil
to sit down with his kids
before he left and actually
explain to them, not
just what he was
doing, but the fact
that he might not come back.
At this point in
the movie, this
is a family that’s been slowly
chipped away at in many ways
by the pressures and the
needs of the NASA program
and the mission to the moon.
And so this kind
of forced assembly
of the family, this almost
formal alignment of them
at this table, where
everyone is kind of
forced to look at each other,
that’s kind of dictated
the look and feel
of the scene for me
and Linus Sandgren, the DP,
at a time in the movie where
there’s a lot of
movement, there’s
a lot of forward momentum.
We’ve seen missions.
We’ve seen training
maneuvers go wrong.
We’ve seen action set pieces.
We’ve seen deaths.
It felt like here was a moment
for the movie to actually
just grind to a halt
for these few minutes
and just exist in more or less
static shots of these four
faces at this table,
this kind of quadrangle
of people who have
to basically stare
each other down.”
“Does anyone have
any other questions?”
“Do you think
you’re coming back?”
“We have a real
confidence in the mission.
And, ah, there are some risks,
but we have every intention
of coming back.”
“But you might not.”
“And Neil, at the center of
it, who is not going to be
let off the hook.
Janet is going to
make sure that he
tells the cold hard
truth to his boys.”
“That’s right.”
“And something that Ryan
and I talked a lot about,
and Ryan really sort
of had a huge hand
in shaping the
scene and finding
different ways to play it.
And Claire Foy who plays
Janet was very much the same.
One thing we all talked
about was the fact
that Neil is someone who
somehow seemed to not
be overly scared by the
idea of strapping himself
to a missile and blasting
through the atmosphere
and blasting into
the void of space
and going further
physically from the Earth
than any human
being in history.
But this is something
that scares him,
the idea that the one
thing that can really
scare Neil Armstrong is
this kind of conversation
on the eve of a mission, this
enormous and this important,
to actually sit
down and confront
his children about the fact
that he may not return.
That that would
actually be in many ways
the hardest mission of all.”
