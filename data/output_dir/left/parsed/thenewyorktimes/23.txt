It’s the late ’90s. You make
some dumb choices.
You get charged with
robbing a Subway.
You spend four years
in prison.
It’s 1995.
Your friends rob a KFC.
You drive the getaway car.
Four years in jail.
That was then.
Now you’re a pastor
at a church.
Today, you run a successful
flooring business.
You’ve paid your dues.
You’ve made amends.
Now you want to have
a voice in the world.
But, you live in Florida.
The Sunshine State is
one of only four states
that permanently bars felons
from casting a ballot.
And there are 1.7 estimated 
million people there
who are disenfranchised 
due to a prior felony conviction.
Over 10% of adults
in the state cannot vote.
Nearly one in
four black adults
is disenfranchised.
The law does provide one
way for former felons
to get their
voting rights back.
But don’t get your hopes up.
Then you have to wait
another 10, 12 years.
Why? Because there is a
backlog of about 10,000 cases.
Finally, as many as 20 years
later, you get your big day in court.
If your hearing was in front
of Governor Rick Scott,
you amost certainly 
heard this:
I deny restoration 
of civil rights.
I deny restoration 
of civil rights.
At this point, I'm going to deny
restoration of civil rights.
I deny restoration
of civil rights.
I deny restoration
of civil rights.
So it’s all denied.
Well, first off, thanks for your 
work for the state.
Thank you.
At this point, I don’t 
feel comfortable
giving your restoration of civil rights.
But congratulations on your work,
and congratulations on your daughter.
Thank you.
The law gives the governor
and his cabinet members
the power to decide our fate.
And there’s no
rules or guidelines.
There is no right to clemency.
There’s no standards.
The governor goes first.
If I deny, then it’s over.
The governor can
turn you away for any reason
no matter how petty.
Just don’t get traffic
tickets all the time.
I mean, I mean it
just says something.
It says you
don’t care about the law.
And it’s not just me.
Governor Scott has denied 
way more people
than his predecessors.
In the last eight years,
the number of disenfranchised
citizens in Florida
has increased by
nearly 200,000 people.
But wait, how did
we even get here?
The law is 150
years old and was
designed to keep people that
looked like me from voting.
When the Civil War ended,
freed slaves represented almost
half of Florida’s population.
The state’s all-white lawmakers
came up with a racist plan
to prevent blacks
from gaining power.
They created Black Codes,
not-so-subtly named 
laws that subjected
black people to harsh
sentences for minor offenses.
They then barred anyone with
a conviction from voting.
They didn’t even try 
to hide it.
For the next 150 years,
no one questioned the law.
And now, here we are.
Florida voters will get to
decide on a ballot referendum
that would restore
voting rights to felons
who have done their time.
Murderers and sex
offenders are excluded.
To pass Amendment 4,
voters would need 60% 
or more in November.
Vote “Yes” in November to
restore voting rights.
Be our voice today
so everyone invested in
the future of Florida
can help shape that future.
