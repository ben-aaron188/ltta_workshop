Most people know that Facebook
has information about them.
We submit things like
our names, our hometowns,
our ages, our birthdays
and our interests,
and we assume that Facebook
is collecting that data.
But Facebook has much
more data on most people
than they realize.
Facebook can take all
the data that you submit
and combine it with
data from other users
and outside information to
construct a profile of you.
Facebook uses nearly
100 different data points
to classify your
interests and activities.
This would include basic stuff
like your age and gender,
but also more
complicated information
like whether you
own a motorcycle
or you recently went on
vacation or whether you’re
a gadget geek.
Researchers have found
that by using signals
such as your likes
and interactions,
Facebook could tell if
you were in a relationship
or going through a breakup.
Facebook doesn’t just 
know who you are.
It also knows
where you are.
If you have location tracking
turned on, Facebook
collects an enormous
amount of location data
about where you’re going, 
where you came from,
where you live,
where you work,
what restaurants and
businesses you tend to go to.
And they use this information
to target ads at you.
And location data could
reveal other people who
live in your house,
even if you’re not
connected to them
on Facebook.
Now obviously,
Facebook knows what
its users buy when they
click on ads from Facebook.
But what most
people don’t realize
is that they have
ways of tracking
your offline 
purchases as well.
For many years, Facebook 
has had partnerships
with data brokers that
collected information
about people’s purchases.
So for example, if you buy a
burrito with your credit card,
Facebook could know 
about that transaction,
match it with a credit card
that you’ve added
to Facebook or 
Facebook Messenger,
and start showing you ads
for indigestion medicine.
One of the most controversial
parts of Facebook data collection
is a feature called
“People You May Know.”
And this is where Facebook
uses many different signals
of what it knows about you
to determine who
else you might be connected to.
And this is not always things
that you share with Facebook.
It might be contacts
in your phone.
It might be people who have
been in the same room as you.
Facebook was using location
data to recommend friends.
So it might have
been recommending
people who share
a doctor with you
or work in the same building.
Facebook can also be
used to compile data
about your political activity
like protests or marches you go to.
In one case in 2016,
the A.C.L.U. found
that 500 police organizations
had signed up
for a service called
Geofeedia, which scraped
data from social networks
like Facebook, Twitter
and Instagram to help
officers look for users who
might be in a specific location
or attending a specific protest.
For example, Geofeedia
claimed it helped
the Baltimore Police Department
monitor and respond
to the protests after
the death of Freddie Gray.
Facebook doesn’t just know
who you are, where you are
and what you buy.
It also can be used to figure
out what kinds of things
you might do in the future.
To predict life outcomes,
like whether you will be
addicted to substances,
whether you will switch
political parties,
whether you’re physically healthy
or physically unhealthy.
These are all part of the
information that advertisers
love to know because it helps
them better target users.
