Hi I‘m Fox San Antonio’s
Jessica Headly
and I’m Ryan Wolf, our greatest responsibility ...
The news site Deadspin
recently produced a mash
up video that went viral
and unsettled many Americans.
It exposed how America’s
largest broadcaster forced
its local anchors
to read an Orwellian script.
The Sinclair
Broadcasting Group
demanded its local anchors
recite the same lines
demonizing media and sowing
distrust with warnings like this:
What’s worse, if you actually
watch Sinclair’s programming,
you’ll see they violate almost
everything they warn against.
So far no hearings on
the big uranium deal.
That’s right.
That’s a Sinclair host promoting
the debunked conspiracy
theory that Hillary Clinton gave
away 20% of America’s uranium to Russia.
It could
involve kickbacks
to the Clinton Foundation.
Oh, and here’s another segment
alluding to the baseless
conspiracy theory that
a Democratic staffer was
murdered for leaking
party emails to WikiLeaks.
There’s a theory Democratic
National Committee e-mails were
given to Wikileaks by a DNC
whistleblower who was later
gunned down.
Maybe it was him. Maybe
it was the Russians.
And what about this warning:
Personal bias?
Well, Sinclair actually has
an entire syndicated segment
that does...exactly that.
The host is a former
Trump media adviser.
Local Sinclair
stations are forced
to broadcast his pieces
multiple times a week.
Predictably, they almost
always defend Trump.
Facts show that
our country is fine
and it is heading in
the right direction.
And this third
warning from Sinclair:
Sinclair even
dedicated a segment
to the existence of a secretive
deep state, void of any evidence.
It‘s a term President
Trump tweeted about
earlier this year.
The main source:
another former Trump
adviser, Sebastian Gorka.
Talking at the highest
levels of US government.
The main facts: a
public opinion poll.
The only skepticism offered
in the two-minute piece
were these six seconds.
Some critics call the deep
state a conspiracy theory
peddled by Republicans
hoping to undermine the FBI.
Clearly Sinclair doesn’t
practice what they preach.
Large corporations
with partisan agendas
should not be broadcasting into 
72% of American households,
under the guide of local news.
That’s why federal regulators
must stop Sinclair’s purchase
of Tribune Media.
Pay attention to the story here,
and maybe at Fox,
and maybe on Breitbart.
And maybe in the US Senate.
But you won’t hear it anywhere else, 
so, you know where to look.
