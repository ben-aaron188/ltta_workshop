Over the course of just eight days,
a kind of mini world war
played out inside Syria.
Conflict intensified,
involving major players
like the U.S., Russia,
Turkey, Israel and Iran.
Kurds, rebel groups,
and forces loyal to Syrian leader
Bashar al-Assad also got involved.
Here’s how one of the
most chaotic weeks
in the Syrian war unfolded.
Saturday, Feb. 3.
A Russian airplane is shot
down over Idlib province,
apparently by anti-Assad rebels.
Sunday, Feb. 4.
Pro-Assad forces
bomb the same province.
A suspected chemical
attack is reported
by doctors in rural Idlib.
Rebels blame the Syrian regime.
Monday, Feb. 5.
Russians launch airstrikes
targeting Eastern Ghouta,
a rebel held area near
the capital, Damascus,
leaving more than 100 dead
over the next several days.
Tuesday, Feb. 6.
The U.N. calls for a cease-fire,
saying Syria faces
an “extreme” humanitarian crisis.
Syrians say Israeli warplanes
fired missiles near Damascus.
Fighting continues between
Turks and Kurds
in the Kurdish majority region of Afrin.
And Turkey restates that from there,
it will push 80 miles
further into Manbij,
a Kurdish-held city
with a U.S. military presence.
Wednesday, Feb. 7.
Top U.S. generals visit an
American base near Manbij,
in what was seen
as a direct message
to Turkey, a NATO ally,
to keep its distance.
Pro-Assad forces attack
U.S.-backed fighters
in Eastern Syria.
The U.S. launches a rare
air assault in response.
At least 100
pro-Assad troops,
including Russian mercenaries,
are presumed dead.
Thursday, Feb. 8.
Rebels and civilians continue
to suffer
withering air assaults
in Eastern Ghouta.
Some of the worst
of the seven-year civil war.
Saturday, Feb. 10.
An Israeli F-16 crashes
in northern Israel,
after coming under heavy
fire by the Syrian military.
Israel said it had shot
down an Iranian drone that
entered its airspace after
being launched from Syria.
A Turkish helicopter is also
shot down by Kurdish fighters.
Two pilots are killed and seven
other Turks die in fighting.
It’s the highest
one day death toll
since the Turkish
incursion in Syria.
All of this played out
against the backdrop
of the continuing U.S.
mission to defeat ISIS —
a fight that remains ongoing,
even as other conflicts arise.
