There’s a time and
place for a political debate.
But now is the
time to unite as a country.
I don’t want to get into
that debate right now.
There will be an absolute
appropriate time for us
to talk about
policies and politics.
I’m sure that folks will want
to score political points
off this tragedy.
But I think we need
to wait.
Before we begin to advocate for new laws,
I think it is eminently
fair to say, how are we
doing enforcing the ones we
currently have.
Had the Obama administration simply followed
federal law, and enforced the law
existing gun laws made
it illegal for the Sutherland Springs
shooter to
buy a gun.
And all you hear now is let’s have new
laws, new laws, when we don’t
enforce the laws we have.
We will lift the victims and their families and the entire community
in prayer.
Scripture says ...
They’re just sick people.
They are mentally imbalanced.
How do we make sure that
individuals with mental illness
do not touch a gun.
Often underneath this is a
diagnosis of mental illness.
We are committed to working
with state and local leaders
to help secure our schools
and tackle the difficult issue
of mental health.
