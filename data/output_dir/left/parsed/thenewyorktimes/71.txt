“I don’t know how
I start a play.
I probably start it
with the first sentence.
I know it’s not going
to be there for very long,
but I have to get — opening
the door a little bit,
sticking my head in,
and seeing what’s in there.”
Neil Simon was one
of the most popular,
and perhaps the most
prolific, playwright
in the history of
American theater.
He redefined
comedy, using humor
not simply to entertain,
but to tell soulful stories
about the frictions of
urban life and family intimacy.
“What are you doing?”
“What?”
“You know the doctor
said you’re not supposed
to smoke cigars anymore.”
“Who’s smoking?
Am I smoking it?
Do you see smoke
coming from the cigar?”
“But you got it
in your mouth.”
“I’m rehearsing.
I’ll do the show later.”
The New York Times sat
down with Simon in 2008
to talk about his
work and his life.
“I started actually
in the Bronx.
1927, July 4, and
always thought
from then on that they were
celebrating my birthday.”
Simon grew up in nearby
Washington Heights,
an enclave for working class
Jews before the war.
But his home life
was terrible,
with a father who
was rarely around
and a mother who struggled
to make ends meet.
“Well, my father and
mother broke up so often
that after a while,
it was no news to me.
We would have to take in
boarders to help feed us.
They sat at the table.
My mother made
dinner for them.
It was really tough
for me, because I said,
my father should be here.
Not these men.
They weren’t un-nice, but it
was a very difficult thing
to grow up with.”
Simon’s way out was through
his older brother Danny,
a budding comedy writer
who got him started
on his future career.
Together, they landed
a job writing gags
for the 1950s television
legend, comedian Sid Caesar.
“What is your name?”
“John Baxter.”
“John Baxter, you’re fired!”
In Caesar’s famous
writing room,
the young Neil Simon found
himself among a who’s who
of the future of funny.
Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner,
Larry Gelbart, Mel Tolkin
and a very young Woody Allen.
For Simon, it was an inspiring
but tough cast of characters.
“My problem was the shyness.
I could think of
the line, but I
wasn’t going to say like
Mel Brooks would, ‘I got it.
I got it.’
That’s what he would do.
I would have to sit next to
Carl Reiner and whisper it.
And Carl would jump up
and he says, ‘Neil has it.
Neil has it.’
He says, ‘The man walks
in and ba-dum bum bum.’
Whatever it was.
And they liked it.”
“Get someone up
here right away.
Because I need them.
That’s fine.
I know they are.
You tell them.
Who are you?
What are —
what are you talking about?
Let me say what I —
I told everybody that’s fine.
Fine!
All right, talk to each other.
That’s right!”
Like many in the
writers room,
Simon aspired to do more
than write jokes,
but he saw firsthand how even
Caesar’s most-seasoned writers
had a tough time
breaking into theater.
“Mel Tolkin, who was
the head writer, said,
‘I got a play. I wrote it
with Lucille Kallen’ —
who was another
writer on the show.
It closed in one night.
And so I say, why
would I have the gall
to write a play when these
two really seasoned people
can’t get it on?
So I said, I better
write about what I know.”
Writing what he knew
would lead Simon
to help invent
a whole new genre:
the comedy of urban neuroses.
His big breakthrough play
and screenplay
was based on Simon’s
life as a newlywed
with his wife, Joan Baim.
“It was about getting married
and living together
for the first time without
knowing how to do that.
And what it’s like when
your husband and wife have
their first fight.
And it’s trauma.
It’s just trauma.”
“You’re hysterical!”
“I am not hysterical!
I know exactly what
I’m saying, Paul.
It’s all over between us,
and it’s never gonna
be any good anymore.”
“And ‘Barefoot in the Park’
became an easy play for me
to write, because it
was a loving play.
It was about me and Joan.
She was beautiful.
She was absolutely beautiful.”
Simon Says he met Joan at a
softball game in the Poconos,
and it was love
at first pitch.
“I’m batting, and there
she is pitching at me.
So I said, I really have
to get a hold of one
and show her.
So I swung — swung,
swang, swing —
at her, and hit the
ball as hard as I could,
which dribbled slowly to her.
And she picked up
the ball with a smile,
and she just waited for
me to get to first base.
And I’m saying, ‘Throw it.
Throw it will you please?’
And she threw it,
and she beat me out.”
“Officer.
We just got married.”
“We married after that
first summer that we met.
All the things were real.
There was a staircase
that took you up
to the top floor
of the building,
and where the man who spoke
a foreign language lived.
He was on the
make for Joan,
who had nothing
to do with him.”
“Will you help me up, please?”
“Oh, with the greatest
of physical pleasure.”
“And we were walking one
night with our dog, Chips,
in the park and it was
a warm summer night.
And she took off her shoes,
and she was barefoot.
And we were walking, and
she said, ‘Why aren’t you
taking off your shoes?
Mine are?’
And I said,
‘I don’t feel like it.’
She said, ‘No, there’s
something wrong with you.
You’re afraid to walk
barefoot in the park.’”
“Paul, you’re crazy.“
“And then, bingo.
You know, play title.”
Inspiration for Simon’s next
play also came from a source
close to home:
his brother Danny, who’d
recently divorced his wife
and moved in
with a friend
named Roy Gerber
to save money.
“Roy Gerber started having
big fights with Danny,
and I just kept watching it
and watching it.
I said, ‘You know, Danny
there’s a play in this.
And he said, ‘Where?
What’s the play?’
I said, ‘These two guys
having more trouble
with themselves than they
would with their wives.
Same problems.
I said, one of you is
the wife, one of you
is the husband.’”
But nailing the script
for “The Odd Couple”
took a lot of trial and error,
as Simon and
director Mike Nichols discovered.
“There was a scene I wrote
that in the rehearsal,
they laughed so hard
Mike said we’d never
be able to put this on,
because the audiences will
die from laughter.
So we got to that scene.
There wasn’t a
single laugh in it.
And I said, ‘What
happened. Mike?’
He said, ‘It’s funny, but they
don’t like what’s happening.
They like these people,
and you’re
making them go in a way that
is not really good for them.’
So I changed that, and we got
less laughs but more cheers
for the play.
So I started to
learn about it.
That it’s not all
about the laughter.
It’s about the feelings
that the audience gets.
Do they like these people?
Do they don’t?
Are they living their lives
well, or are they not?”
“The Odd Couple” opened
on Broadway in 1965
and became Simon’s
most successful work.
The play spawned a movie
starring Walter Matthau
as the sportswriting
slob Oscar Madison, and
Jack Lemmon as
neat-freak Felix Unger.
“It’s all over, Felix.
The whole marriage.
We’re getting an annulment.
Don’t you understand?
I don’t want to live
with you anymore.”
The movie, of course, led
to a popular 1970s TV series
with Jack Klugman
and Tony Randall.
Simon had signed away
the rights for the TV series
to Paramount, a decision
he came to regret.
But by this time,
he was already perhaps
Broadway’s biggest and
most bankable writer.
In 1966 alone,
he had four shows
running on Broadway
at the same time,
an unrivaled record.
But just as Simon was
topping the world of theater,
he and Joan got
devastating news.
“We got up early
in the morning,
went to the doctor’s office.
He examined her.
Then he came back in,
and he says, ‘It’s bad.’
‘What?’
‘She’s got cancer.’
And then I start to feel
myself rolling and rolling,
and you’re reaching out
to grab on to your life,
to be able to help her,
and you can’t.
You’re just rolling
and rolling.”
Joan died in 1973
at the age of 39.
They had been married
for 19 years.
Her death sent Neil reeling
and he immediately
sought someone to fill the
void, marrying four times,
twice to the same woman.
“I mean, other wives
are the mistake
you made when you’re married
to someone for 19 years
that you hope you can be
married to for 60 years.
That whole period
is so dark for me.”
After a number of plays
about his failed marriages,
Simon returned to writing
about his childhood struggles
in Jewish working-class
New York.
“What did I tell you
about banging the ball?
Your Aunt Blanche
has a headache."
“I can’t stop now.
It’s a crucial moment
in World Series history.
The Yanks are
playing the Giants.”
“Brighton Beach Memoirs”
was the first of Simon’s
semi-autobiographical trilogy
about a wisecracking teenager
named Eugene Jerome.
“It was about
growing up, idolizing
his older brother, who was
going to go off to the war.
And the kid didn’t want
him to go off to the war."
“You always told me
never to run away.”
“I’m not running away.
I’m leaving.
Only kids run away.”
“Biloxi Blues,”
part two of the trilogy,
was based on Simon’s
own stint in the Army,
and won him his first Tony
award for best play in 1985.
“That’s a mistake, Gene.
Once you start
compromising your thoughts,
you’re a candidate
for mediocrity.”
One of the most memorable
scenes is based on the trip
to a brothel Simon made
as an eager, yet terrified,
young virgin.
“I was on that line
waiting to get in —
you know 15 guys
waiting to get in
to screw this one woman.
And you say, ‘You sure
you want to do this?’”
“O.K. honey.
Do your stuff.”
“What stuff is that?”
“And you do it.
And you come out —
all you think of is,
I’m a man.
I’ve done it.”
In “Broadway Bound,”
part three of the trilogy,
the mother gives
a fiery speech
that channels the turmoil
of Simon’s own mother.
“Is that how it works?
You have an affair,
and I’m left
with the choice of
forgetting about it
or living alone the
rest of my life?
Boy, it’s so simple
for you, isn’t it?”
“Writing that was
difficult and great,
because I was making
a character who
never really spoke open, but
she was not that articulate.
I mean, my mother
could never come out
with a soliloquy like
that and tear him apart.”
But it was his play
“Lost in Yonkers”
that ultimately took Simon
from the realm of comedy
into serious, critically
acclaimed drama.
The play and the
feature film is the story
of two young boys
forced to live
with their domineering
grandmother and
mentally challenged aunt,
a scenario similar to what
Simon faced during his
own childhood exiles.
“You made it so clear.
You just didn’t want to
be touched with love.”
“You don’t just
choose it and say,
‘I think I’ll do
a serious play.’
You know, you say,
‘I want it to be bigger
than what I’ve been writing.’
And I don’t need to have it
being funny all the time.
When you have the heartbeat
of the play there,
you can be funny over here
and you can be funny over here
as long as you don’t
touch the heartbeat.”
“Lost in Yonkers”
would be Simon’s
last major Broadway hit.
It earned him
the Pulitzer Prize.
“Maybe everybody else
here, but not me.
You understand?”
“I never think about
getting better so
that I will be a
better playwright so
that I will win
a Pulitzer Prize,
so that I will do this —
never think about that.
You just think,
get the play there.
Maybe it’ll have a life.
Maybe you’ve done something
good for other people.
Hopefully you’ve done
something for yourself,
the actors, whatever.
It’s just, you want to
get the writing out.
You want to get the
things that you think
about life onto the stage.”
