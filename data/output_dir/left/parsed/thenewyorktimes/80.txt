“I thought about what
are the problems that
are most likely to affect
the future of the world
or future of humanity.”
Elon Musk, a South African-born
engineer, inventor
and billionaire, is one of the
most important entrepreneurs
in the world.
But the 47-year-old
is no stranger
to turmoil, and by
his own account
his career has been
full of highs and lows.
“Just three years ago,
I was showering at the Y and
sleeping on the office floor.
And now, I have got
a million-dollar car
and quite a few
creature comforts.”
After making a fortune with
his first successful startup,
Zip2, Musk gained fame
as the co-founder of PayPal
in the late 1990s.
“So this is an ATM.
What we’re going
to do is transform
the traditional
banking industry.”
The company lost hundreds of
millions of dollars, and Musk
was ousted as CEO because
of internal turmoil.
But when PayPal
went public in 2002,
and then was sold to eBay, Musk —
as the biggest shareholder —
walked away
with $200 million.
By the mid-2000s, Musk
had turned around
and invested almost all
of his PayPal fortune
into his new companies:
SpaceX, Tesla and SolarCity.
With SpaceX, Musk’s aspiration
is out of this world —
literally.
It’s a commercial
space flight company,
which designs and launches
advanced rockets into space.
“Behind me is where 
Falcon 9 would
sit during launch.”
One of its ambitions is to
eventually send people to Mars.
“And I can’t think of
anything more exciting
than going out there and
being among the stars.”
But it has faced some roadblocks.
Their first three
rocket launches —
failed, burning through almost
all of the company’s assets.
But SpaceX has had
recent successes.
The Falcon Heavy launch
earlier this year
was a big milestone
and it carried
an interesting payload:
a dummy astronaut
riding a Tesla car
that was orbiting space.
The company has also
landed contracts with NASA,
but questions about
safety and cost remain.
“We sold over 1,000
cars — and by sold
I mean people put down a
substantial deposit on the car.”
Tesla, Musk’s
electric car company,
is one of the
first of its kind
to work on a large scale.
It has also successfully
disrupted the auto industry.
The company is valued
at over $50 billion.
The Tesla Model S
has been called
the greatest car ever built.
But Tesla has also faced
some setbacks, including
car batteries that caught on fire,
recalls and production delays.
SolarCity, Musk’s renewable
energy venture,
initially had a bright future.
It’s the largest provider
of rooftop solar systems
in the U.S., and the company
boomed on Wall Street.
But after investors raised doubts
about its business model,
SolarCity’s shares
quickly lost value,
and Tesla had to take over
in what was widely
seen as a bailout.
“We really need to make
solar panels as appealing
as electric cars have become.”
But while Musk may have been
flirting with bankruptcy
and calamity for years,
his projects continue
to captivate the
collective imagination.
“Life has to be more than
about solving problems.
There have to be things
that make you proud
to be a member
of humanity.”
