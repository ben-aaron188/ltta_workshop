 Oh.
Something ain’t quite right
with the baby, is there?
Oh …
60 pounds?
80.
80?
God, some of the ones that
seem so tiny are huge.
Um-hmm.
He looks like a 70, 60 …
No dying on us.
Oh, you’re one of those
wobbly ones, ain’t you?
Come on.
All right, well … see
you in an hour or two.
[children shouting
and playing]
Oh, I almost got
you in the face.
Ready, Rosie?
O.K.
Whoa!
That was a good jump!
Carrie, Ken — Ken get on here.
Ken, Trudy.
Whee!
They used, like, when Grandpa
Foss was a baby, that’s
the only thing that they had.
Well, the back things
are, like, really —
I know …
— You could snap it.
We’ll have to fix this.
Oh, all we got to do
is put a board on.
Yeah, well, I don’t want
you guys getting stabbed
by these nails back here.
Where’s my bike?
You want to go put a
board on it right now?
I have no idea if we even
have a big enough board
to put on that.
Hey, there, .
Ah!
There you go.
Come on.
You got to work with me here.
How’s that?
There we go.
Look at that.
All by yourself.
Oh! Easy now.
Bring that leg back up.
Bring it back up.
I’ll fall down!
Stand up!
Well we’re just going to give
him just a little bit, O.K.?
We’ll give
him just a little bit.
What do you think?
Should we name him?
Um, Frodo?
Frodo?
 She’ll be Frodo.
Well, I guess that’s
as good name as any.
Turn that heater on for you.
There we go.
There we go.
O.K., buddy.
Come here.
Frodo, you got it.
O.K., are you ready?
Other way, bud.
Other way.
Oh, there.
Yup, yup. There you go.
See how he’s trying?
He’s trying.
His little tongue’s
a-licking.
Aah!
Frodo, that’s just gross!
 at me.
Look at him.
He’s nursing.
Good job, buddy.
Good job.
O.K., Mom, I’ll stop now?
O.K., go ahead and pull.
His tongue …
Because he kind of stopped.
You got to listen.
Because sometimes
they’ll take a breath
and they’ll suck the
milk down in their lungs
at the same time.
So you’ve got to —
yeah, sometimes you’ve
got to pull that out.
… little nose
a little twitch.
Twitch, twitch, twitch …
Oh, look it. He says, ”Hi, that’s
such good stuff.
I can’t even pull my
tongue back in my mouth.
Mom, Mom!
Don’t let her out!
She wants to lay down.
Do you want her to lay down?
What do you think?
I don’t know.
I’ve — first time I
ever pulled a calf.
Dad’s never left me alone.
Well, she wants to lay down.
Well, then let her lay down.
Just let her go.
Let her go.
Are the knees
trying to get out?
There a little bit.
Come on, push, baby.
There you go.
Push … push.
Oh!
There you go. Push.
Blech.
It doesn’t want to come out.
No.
It does not want to come out.
Where’s your nose
at, above.
Right there.
He’s not sideways, is he?
The shoulder is, I think.
I wouldn’t piddle
around too long.
I’m trying not to.
Push — pull down on the baby.
When you pull, pull down.
It’s not like I’ve pulled
a calf a 110 times, either.
But you’ve pulled from a goat.
You’re doing good, mama.
There we go.
Let her get dilated …
You just be careful.
If she starts going down,
you get out of the way.
 Push, baby.
Push.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Woo!
Woo!
