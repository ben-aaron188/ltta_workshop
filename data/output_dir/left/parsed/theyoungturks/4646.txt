OPPONENTS OF THE TRUMP CARE BILL
HAVE REPEATEDLY HAMMERED
HOME SOME OF WHAT WE BELIEVE
WILL BE THE WORST EFFECTS
IF THE BILL BECOMES A LAW AND SO
FAR, A LOT OF REPUBLICANS
AND CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATORS
ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.
WE'RE GOING TO CATCH YOU UP ON
SOME OF THE CRITIQUES OF
THE BILL, LET'S SEE IF YOU
RECOGNIZE THE SPACES.
MEDICAID IS THE PROGRAM IN
THIS COUNTRY THAT PROVIDES
HEALTH INSURANCE TO ONE IN FIVE
AMERICANS,TO 30 MILLION
KIDS, TO NEARLY 2 OUT OF EVERY
THREE PEOPLE IN A NURSING HOME.
THESE CUTS ARE BLOOD MONEY.
PEOPLE WILL DIE.
LET'S BE VERY CLEAR.
SCENTED SENATE REPUBLICANS ARE
PAYING FOR TAX CUTS FOR THE
WEALTHY WITH AMERICAN LIVES.
WHAT THE REPUBLICAN PROPOSAL
DOES IS THROW 23 MILLION
AMERICANS OFF OF HEALTH
INSURANCE.
WHAT HARVARD UNIVERSITY, WHAT A
PART OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY
AND THE SCIENTISTS THERE
DETERMINED IS WHEN YOU THROW
23 MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF
HEALTH INSURANCE, PEOPLE WITH
CANCER, HEART DISEASE, DIABETES,
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WILL DIE.
I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY IT.
THIS IS NOT ME, THIS A STUDY
AFTER STUDY MAKING THIS POINT.
IT IS COMMON SENSE.
IF YOU HAVE CANCER AND YOUR
INSURANCE IS TAKEN AWAY
FROM YOU, THERE IS A LIKELIHOOD
YOU WILL DIE AND CERTAINLY A
LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU WILL BECOME
MUCH SICKER THEN YOU ARE TODAY.
THAT IS THE FAX.
THERE YOU SEE ELIZABETH
WARREN AND BERNIE SANDERS.
WE SAID MUCH THE SAME THING FOR
A VERY LONG TIME HERE IN
THE PROGRAM AND WE'RE GOING TO
GET BACK TO THE FACTS
UNDERLINING THOSE CLAIMS IN
JUST A LITTLE BIT BUT AS I
ALLUDED TO AN INTRO, REPUBLICANS
DON'T LIKE WHEN YOU POINT
WITH ABILITY AND SO IT HAS LED
TO WEBSITE ARTICLES LIKE
THIS, TOP DEMOCRATS SAY
AMERICANS WILL DIE FROM
OBAMACARE OVERHAUL PASSED BY
GOP HOUSE.
FROM THE DAILY CALLER TARGETING
BERNIE SANDERS, WE'RE
FREAKING OUT OVER THE FACT THAT
22 MINE LOSER HEALTH INSURANCE.
NEW GREEN GRANTS COLUMN
DEMOCRATS LYING TO SAVE
OBAMACARE.
AND HAS A STOP SO WE ALSO HAVE
JULIE BANDERAS, AN ANCHOR
FROM FOX IN THIS CLIP.
I WANT TO FIRST OF ALL TALK
ABOUT WHAT THE DEMOCRATS
HAVE DONE BECAUSE THEY HAVE
SCARED MANY AMERICANS,
ROYAL AMERICANS PLACING TENS
OF BILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE
GOING TO LOSE THEIR INSURANCE.
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE.
I GOT THE CBO REPORT RIGHT HERE.
IT IS 49 PAGES LONG AND I READ
IT.
I DON'T KNOW IF THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE HAVE READ IT BUT I
WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT
IS SAYS BECAUSE IT TALKS ABOUT
THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT
POTENTIALLY WILL BE UNINSURED
UNDER THE GOP PLAN AND ACCORDING
TO THIS IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IN
2018 15 MILLION MORE PEOPLE
WOULD BE UNINSURED UNDER
THIS LEGISLATION THAN UNDER THE
CURRENT LAW PRIMARILY AND I
WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WERE
PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE
PENALTY FOR NOT HAVING INSURANCE
WOULD BE ELIMINATED.
AND AT THE SAME TIME, THE
SUBSIDIES THAT WILL MAKE IT
AFFORDED WILL ALSO BE
ILLUMINATED SO SHE IS GOING
TO FOCUS ON THE PAR OBVIOUSLY
THAT SHE LIKES BUT THERE,
WE ARE BEING UNFAIR BY FOCUSING
ON THE TESTS THAT ARE LIKELY
TO RESULT FROM PEOPLE BEING
THIRD OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE.
VERSUS NOTE FOR THE RECORD
THAT BANDERAS IS A NEWS
ANCHOR FOR FOX NEWS SHE IS NOT
AN OPINION HOST, HENRY WILL
SAY I DO COMMENTARY AND I THINK
THAT IS FAIR.
NOW THEY HAVE TAKEN AWAY FOR
BALANCE, GOOD.
AT LEAST YOU ARE NOT LYING IN
MORE, IT IS A CONSERVATIVE
NEWS STATION.
BUT THEY STILL PRETEND THAT
THEIR NEWS ANCHORS TO
STRAIGHT NEWS.
OR SHE IS, THOSE DASTARDLY
DEMOCRATS GREASY SCARING
PEOPLE SAYING THAT IF YOU LOSER
HEALTH INSURANCE, YOU MIGHT DIE.
OF COURSE YOU COULD.
OKAY, OTHER THAN COMMON SENSE,
LET'S BEGIN TO BREAK IT DOWN.
PART OF THEIR ATTACK AGAINST
SANDERS, WARREN, AND DEMOCRATS
IS LOOK AT HOW UNCIVIL THEY ARE
BEING.
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE
DYING.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT, YOU ARE
GETTING PEOPLE RILED UP.
LOOK, IF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
FREE COLLEGE, THIS IS SUPER
IMPORTANT ISSUE, BUT THERE IS
NO ONE'S LIFE ON THE LINE
GENERALLY SPEAKING.
IF YOU STRETCH THAT THE PEOPLE
ARE DYING, THAT IS WRONG.
THAT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO GO
AND I CAN GIVE YOU 1000 OBVIOUS
EXAMPLES BUT THERE ARE A COUPLE
OF ISSUES OF THE GOVERNMENT
DEALS WITH THAT ARE DEFINITELY
CLEARLY LIFE-AND-DEATH.
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THERE IS A
RIGHT OR WRONG DECISION AND THAT
IS WHY WE DEBATE THESE THINGS
AND WE HAVE A STRONG OPINION ONE
DIRECTION BUT IF YOU ARE TALKING
ABOUT WAR FOR EXAMPLE AND YOU
SAY BECAUSE OF THAT, PEOPLE WILL
DIE.
THAT IS LITERALLY TRUE.
YOU ARE BEING HYSTERICAL.
YOU ARE BEING HYPERBOLIC.
IT'S LIKE THOSE PROTESTERS FOR
THE VIETNAM WAR.
THEY SAY WE GO TO VIETNAM,
THOUSANDS WILL DIE.
YOU ARE BEING HYSTERICAL.
LIKE YOU ARE GOING TO GO TO THE
MIDDLE OF A JUNGLE AND HAVE
A WAR, YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO DIE?
OF COURSE, THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS
IN A WAR AND IF YOU HAVE
HEALTHCARE AND THE NEW GET SICK,
FOR EXAMPLE, CANCER, WILL
YOU DIE?
YEAH, THAT IS KIND OF HOW CANCER
WORKS.
I THINK IN THIS CASE YOU
MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO FAIR TO
HER BECAUSE SHE DID FOCUS ON THE
CLAIMS ABOUT THE DEBT BUT SHE
ALSO SAID THAT SHE DIDN'T LIKE
THE FACT THAT WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD LOSE
THE HEALTH INSURANCE WHETHER OR
NOT THEY WOULD DIE OR NOT THE
FACT THAT WE ARE POINTING
OUT THE 22,000 PEOPLE ARE LOSING
THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE.
BERNIE SANDERS AND READ THE
REPORT, THE CBO DID.
AND IN DOUBLE CHUMS COMMENTS,
SAYING WERE MAKING
JUDGMENTS BEFORE WE WRITE IT.
IT'S A SIMILAR TO THE HOUSE
BILL, INVESTMENTS AND HOW
MANY WILL LOSE HEALTH INSURANCE
ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL.
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS AT THAT
POINT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE SAYING IT IS NOT BASED ON
ANYTHING, IT IS JUST LIES.
BERNIE SANDERS AND ELIZABETH
WARREN ARE EXAGGERATING.
LET'S GO OVER SOME OF THE
EVIDENCE THAT POLITICIZED
LOOKED INTO THIS INCLUDING
REACHING OUT OUT TO THE
BERNIE SANDERS CAMPAIGN ABOUT
THE STUDIES HE TALKED ABOUT
THE VIDEO YOU JUST SAW AND ONE
OF THEM BY THE HARVARD
CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS
PROJECTED AN ADDITIONAL
217,000 DEATHS UNDER THE NEXT
DECADE OR 21,700 PER YEAR.
THE SECOND PIECE OF EVIDENCE
ESTIMATED THAT THERE WOULD
BE ALMOST 44,000 DEATHS ANNUALLY
DUE TO THE GOP'S HEALTH
POLICY CHANGES AND THAT INITIAL
ESTIMATE MEANT, BY THE WAY,
WAS BASED OFF OF A SMALLER
NUMBER OF PEOPLE BEING TORN
OFF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE AND
THE CBO IS CALCULATED.
IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE WORSE
THAN THAT IF YOU WEREN'T UPDATED
BASED ON THE NEW INFORMATION AND
THEY CONCLUDE SAYING WE FOUND AT
LEAST SEVEN ACADEMIC PAPERS THAT
DETECTED A LINK BETWEEN SECURING
HEALTH INSURANCE AND A DECLINE
IN MORTALITY WHICH SORT OF MAKES
SENSE EVEN WITHOUT CITATIONS,
BUT WHETHER THEY HAVE IT.
WE FOUND AMPLE EVIDENCE IN THE
ACADEMIC LITERATURE TO
SUGGEST THAT LEGISLATION ON THE
SKILLED HOUSE BILL WOULD
PRODUCE THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL
TESTS.
THAT MEANS YOU CAN THEN CLAIM
THAT THIS WILL CAUSE
THOUSANDS OF DEATHS.
SOME OF THE STUDIES LOOKED
INTO WHAT HAPPENED WHEN STATES
DIDN'T SIGN UP FOR THE MEDICAID
EXPANSION AS COMPARED TO STATES
TODAY AND THERE ARE A LOT OF
WAYS TO DO THOSE STUDIES IN
ALMOST ALL OF THEM CAME TO THE
CONCLUSION THAT THE PEOPLE, THE
STATES AND INCENTIVE FOR
MEDICAID, X NUMBER OF PEOPLE
DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE AND OF
THOSE, A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE GOT
SICK AND WHEN, NOT SICK LIKE I
TWISTED MY ANGLE AND WENT
TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM.
GOT SICK WITH A CONDITION
THAT NEEDS TO BE TREATED
REGULARLY AND THEY DIDN'T GET
BETTER TREATMENT BECAUSE
THEY DIDN'T HAVE INSURANCE AND
YES, THEY DIED.
THAT IS KIND OF HOW HEALTHCARE
WORKS.
IS THERE A SCENARIO IN WHICH
PEOPLE HAVE LESS INSURANCE,
SO MORE OF THEM LIVE?
THAT MAKES NO SENSE.
MEDICAL MALPRACTICE I GUESS.
OF COURSE MORE PEOPLE WILL DIE.
POLITIFACT, I WANT TO GIVE THEM
CREDIT OVERALL, I LOVE WHAT
THEY DO AND THAT THEY EXIST, BUT
THEY ARE ALSO FRUSTRATING
ON SOME COUNTS.
THEY LOOK AT THE FACTS,
WONDERFUL.
WE LOVE THAT PART.
WE ARE NOT - RIGHT
WINGERS HATE IT WHEN YOU
LOOK AT THE FACTS.
WE LIKE
IT, WE WANT YOU TO LOOK
INTO FACTS EVEN MORE.
HOLD EVERYBODY ACCOUNTABLE.
AND THEN WHEN THEY MENTION THE
TWO HARVARD PROFESSORS
BERNIE SANDERS' STAFF
QUOTED WERE NOT
PEER-REVIEWED STUDIES, I WAS
LIKE, THAT IS INTERESTING.
THAT IS A DATA POINT THAT THE
RIGHT-WINGERS WOULD DISMISS
THAT IMMEDIATELY.
PEER-REVIEWED, WHO CARES?
THEY WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
IT MEANS.
I WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IS AN
INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT
DATA POINT.
HERE'S THE PART THAT DRIVES ME CRAZY
ABOUT THEM.
THEY HAD TO BE BALANCED BECAUSE
THEY CAN'T ALWAYS RULE
AGAINST REPUBLICANS, OTHERWISE
THEY HAVE A LIBERAL BIAS.
JUST GIVE US A FACTS.
TURNS OUT, BY THE WAY, ON THE
PEER-REVIEWED OR NOT, THOSE
ARTICLES, POLITIFACT LATER SAYS
IN A PARENTHESES BURIED IN THE
ARTICLE WE ARE QUOTING STUDIED ñ
STUDIES THAT WERE PEER-REVIEWED.
NOW WE HAVE TO FACT CHECK
POLITIFACT.
THEY ARE DOING ANALYSIS BASED
OFF OF DATA THAT COMES FROM
STUDIES THAT WERE PEER-REVIEWED.
FINE, LET'S PUT THAT
NITPICKING ASIDE IF YOU
WANT TO CALL IT THAT.
THE END, THEIR CONCLUSION IS
WHAT BERNIE SANDERS SAID IS
MOSTLY TRUE.
NO, YOU JUST TOLD US THAT IT WAS
TOTALLY TRUE.
EVEN THE TWO STUDIES THAT
THEY CITED WHERE IT WAS
EQUIVOCAL EVIDENCE THEY RESELL
TO THE AUTHORS AND AUTHORS
SAID, NO, THE OTHER STUDIES ARE
RIGHT.
PROBABLY THOUSANDS WILL DIE.
I'M NOT SURE THEY CONFIRED IT, BUT
THEY CONFIRMED THE OTHER
STUDIES.
THEY HAD NO DISSENT.
IT'S MOSTLY TRUE.
THE ONLY REASON THEY CALL IT
MOSTLY TRUE IS BALANCE.
I HAVE TO BALANCE IT, IF I KEEP
SAYING THE LIBERALS ARE
COMPLETELY TRUE AND
RIGHT-WINGERS ARE MAKING UP
STUFF, I WILL BE ACCUSED OF
BIAS.
NO, DO YOUR JOB.
FACT.
ACCORDING TO THE FACTS YOU GAVE
IN THE ARTICLE, SANDERS
STATEMENT WAS NOT 99% TRUE, IT
WAS 1 BILLION% TRUE.
POLITICIZED LOOK AT THAT AND SAY
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS 1
BILLION% SO I'M GOING TO RANK
HIS STATEMENT MOSTLY TRUE.
I THINK YOU SHOULD START A
WEBSITE, POLITIFACT FACT
WHERE YOU BACKCHECK EACH
POLITICIZED ARTICLE AND
THEN YOU EVALUATE HOW ACCURATE
THEY ARE.
ONE LESS THING THOUGH, YOU JUST
OFF BOX THERE SAYING YOU
ARE SAYING PEOPLE ARE GOING
TO DIE, THAT IS THE
RESPONSIBLE EVEN THOUGH THE
EVIDENCE IS THAT I'D TRUE.
DO YOU REMEMBER, SOME OF YOU ARE
TOO YOUNG, DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN WE WERE DEBATING OBAMA
CARE IN THE FIRST PLACE WHAT
RIGHT-WINGERS WERE SAYING ABOUT
OBAMACARE AND WHAT IT WOULD DO?
THEY WERE NOT POINTING TO
PEER-REVIEWED STUDIES FROM
THE PEOPLE DIE, THEY WERE SAYING
FREEDOM WOULD DIE.
AMERICA WITHÖ THERE WAS A GUY
WITH A FLAG SAYING THAT
THEY ARE GOING TO KILL AMERICA
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
GET THROUGH ME AND I WAS PLAYED
ON FOX NEWS.
I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS
PEER-REVIEWED.
I DON'T THINK THEY LOOKED INTO
IT.
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I AM
TALKING ABOUT THAT WE ARE
PARSING WHETHER BERNIE SANDERS
BACKED UP BY ALMOST EVERY
STUDY CAN BE CALLED MOSTLY TRUE
OR COMPLETELY TRUE.
THEY MADE UP THINGS ABOUT DEATH.
THEY JUST MADE THEM UP AND TO
THE STATUS SAY IT.
BUT EVERYBODY IN THE
ESTABLISHMENT PRESS HAS TO FIND
SOME SORT OF BALANCE.
POLITICAL FACT BACK IF YOU ARE
POLITICAL BALANCE AND MAYBE
YOU SHOULD DO THIS IF YOU ARE
POLITICAL FACT YOU SHOULD
LOOK AT THE FACTS AND JUST CALL
IT LIKE IT IS.
