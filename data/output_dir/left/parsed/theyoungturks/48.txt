we have some important updates on Jamal
khashoggi I hope I'm pronouncing that
right although I mess it up every other
day he's of course the Saudi journalist
killed by Saudi Arabia we also have some
load some responses to share with you
but first let's go to the hill they
report the following an individual
suspected of being part of the group of
Saudis involved in the death of
journalist Jamal khashoggi was
reportedly seen around Istanbul wearing
show his clothes a fake beard and
glasses on the day of the killing
CNN citing a senior Turkish official
reported that the man in the video
identified as Mustafa al-madani was
captured by surveillance cameras leaving
the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on the
day khashoggi died there he appears to
be wearing the same clothes Khashoggi
was seen wearing when he entered the
consulate Turkish investigators have
said they have audio and other evidence
that proves Khashoggi was killed and
dismembered by a group of Saudis in the
consulate the Turkish official told CNN
that al-madani
was used as a body double in the
operation so what we're looking at here
is and this really you know really
struck me that it's so concerted and so
organized and so planned that it really
seems like like a smoke-filled back room
in a way and I always try to avoid the
smoke-filled back room
conspiracies whenever possible but this
is one of those instances where you're
like the dude wore a fake beard I mean
that is wild so Trump is waffling on
this and he's saying I would love it if
NBS didn't do it and he's basically you
know trying to play both sides and
pretend like he's tough on crime but at
the same time trying to keep the
us-saudi alliance intact and yeah it's
just a mess
so explain why it is that they would use
the body double was it the Saudis
attempts to make it seem as though
khashoggi had left the consulate yes
yeah so two natural conclusions come out
of that right well one part is
surprising those natural conclusions are
if you bring a bone saw and an autopsy
expert and a body double it wasn't
something that happened by accident
right over end of this it's not even
close that's super obvious if the bone
saw for some insane reason
not convince you because you watch Fox
News or something well the body doubles
got to do it doesn't it I mean who
brings a body double to an accidental
killing I think that's a thing so second
conclusion which actually haunts me in
some ways more is I I don't think they
could have possibly have known what
Khashoggi was going to wear that and so
I believe that is to show he's actual
clothes yeah I think they took it off of
them before they killed him because they
obviously doesn't have blood on him
and remember they likely chopped off his
fingers while he was still alive so
likely they stripped him naked tortured
him and it's all on audio apparently so
the Turkish government has that they
keeps threatening to use it and release
it in fact they say they're gonna
release it tomorrow so we'll see and so
naked tortured parts of his body chopped
off and then killed and then beheaded
and dismembered we believe but we're not
positive about the order we don't know
if they beheaded him to kill him
so anyone trying to say that this was
not premeditated is an obvious obvious
liar well thankfully the moral voice of
our generation Pat Robertson has some
thoughts on this for us so let's take a
look at that I'll say it now and I'll
say it over and over again we've got the
cooler rhetoric and what the president
is trying to do is to give the Saudis
and out and calls for sanctions and
calls for punitive action against the
Saudis is not is ill-advised and Wendy I
just don't think you've got a hundred
billion dollars worth of arm sales which
is you know that's one of those things
but more than that we've got to have
some Arab allies we have to have it we
cannot alienate a biggest player in the
Middle East whose bulwark against Iran
can we have somebody that's killing
journalists that are US residents is the
question you know we've had so many
people killed I mean we had CIA people
killed in 11
they people have been taken hostage here
over the years I know it's bad but I
mean we've had all kinds of stuff but
you don't blow up an international
alliance over one person I mean I'm
sorry oh what a great Christian thoughts
are on reproductive rights right when it
comes to zygotes I'm sure he's very much
concerned about you know being pro-life
but when it comes to living breathing
human beings who happen to be
journalists who get murdered well you
know these things happen what are you
gonna do I mean there was some CIA
people at some time in the past you know
that's that's a great point Anna and I
hadn't thought about it in that context
imagine if the Saudis had committed an
abortion on purpose would Pat Robertson
see it completely differently wait a
minute I didn't know the Saudis were
that terrible
they're killing what they would consider
to be people before they're born after
they're born dismembering them and
beheading them is perfectly fine if you
got an arms deal at stake but before
they're bored that's an outrage before
they're an actual person oh my god we
got to protect him I I don't know but
there actually is no bounce to
Robertson's hypocrisy so he might even
say oh they did an abortion what's one
abortion when we got an arms deal yeah
look imagine if he applied that logic
back in the day to the guy who started
his religion oh yeah I mean we got to
deal with the Roman Empire what's one
guy compared to a gigantic deal with we
have with the biggest empire in the
world I mean this one little guy from
Nazareth what does he matter I liked how
he ignores all of the parts of the Bible
that are just pacifist you know and this
really shows that he puts political
ideology above everything else and it
shows that he'll fall in line behind
Donald Trump come hell or high water
because he actually views him kind of as
his demigod more than heave used the
words of his own Lord and Savior so I
find this it's just strange to me that
you can have Christians who are really
good people you know like dr. Martin
Luther King jr. for example who use the
message of the Bible for all the right
reasons
then you could also get the polar
opposite philosophy to the point where
it's comical mm-hmm I don't even think
pat robertson is trying to preach
anything from the Bible anymore and
after Trump got
elected you're right he does see Trump
as this God figure in fact he thinks
that Donald Trump was chosen by God to
be president he has now become you know
another propaganda arm of the Trump
administration in addition to Fox News
so Jake you know just to answer the
question of whether or not he would be
upset if the Saudis had forced an
abortion I don't think he would be upset
because I do think that politics go
above anything else including his
so-called religious beliefs but Pat
Robertson actually doubled down after
getting criticized for this and he is
the same talking point that Trump uses
which is no but you guys don't
understand the Saudi arms deal is
important because of jobs okay that is a
lie and I wanted to look into that that
claim and actually give you guys some of
the numbers so first off how many jobs
does the US defense industry employ
about 355,000 so Trump claims
oh no this this specific Saudi arms deal
has led to 500,000 jobs in in typical
Trump fashion he keeps changing the
numbers to suit whatever point he's
trying to make so back in January of
this year when MBS was in visiting in
Washington Trump had claimed that this
Saudi arms deal was going to provide
about 40,000 new jobs
fast-forward to today with this whole
Khashoggi controversy all of a sudden
just to justify selling weapons to Saudi
Arabia he's now saying 500,000 there
have been some cases where he's said
600,000 so how many jobs is it it's
certainly not 600,000 not 500,000 and
again just to emphasize or re-emphasize
the US defense industry employs three
hundred fifty five thousand five hundred
jobs for the entire industry exactly and
by the way he said on now doses of
occasions it's a hundred billion dollar
deal it's 110 billion dollar deal it's
fourteen and a half billion I mean you
could say fourteen and a half billion
that's still a lot of money right no but
he's got embellished she has to
embellish on the numbers on the jobs and
and then
that would come in and then Pat Roberts
is of the world of course I'm
questioningly unquestioningly have his
bag I was also amused they had
prosperity gospel preacher paula white
on in a different situation in Pat
Robertson's channel talking about how
well if you look at the Bible it appears
that Jesus is an immigrant but he's not
he's not he never broke any of the laws
okay and he did he have documents right
he's also brown by the way which you
know I don't think they're very
comfortable with that fact right if he
existed at all I should say he's brown
that's the reason in the world he's from
that's right they twist everything to
try to fit their political agenda and
their political agenda has nothing to do
with the teachings of Jesus Christ
now speaking of political agenda I have
one more video for you I think you're
gonna like this Rush Limbaugh also
weighed in on this take a look I
continue to get emails about these the
so called Washington Post journalist
Jamal khashoggi my question is a really
rather simple one where was this concern
for our ambassador and three other men
brutally murdered in Benghazi and
Hillary Clinton's reaction what
difference does it make now
she said the in frustration this is
anybody see a disparity here in
proportion where was this concern
everywhere I don't know about you guys
but I saw Benghazi absolutely everywhere
and it's weird because he's saying this
in service of the point
okay let's ignore the kesaji thing
because let's not go after Donald Trump
yeah so we had about twenty eight
hearings on Benghazi so that that's one
of your answers second of all there was
no armed steel or other relationship we
had to the people who did the killings
in Benghazi if there was we all would
have been massively in favor of cutting
off that arms deal they killed our
ambassador they killed three other
people that's terrible does anybody
think we had a relationship with those
guys
no the made up charges the Republicans
said at the time
somehow the Democrats should have known
about the attack and the terrorists
intentions ahead of time and then
afterwards should have said other words
about it but no one claims that we had a
secret deal with the people who did the
killings in this case we have a giant
deal the devil Trump won't shut up about
what the guys who did the killings
that's a massive difference of course
you have to assume if you're rush
limbaugh that your audience is not that
bright so you'll be able to escape that
by them including the incredibly
obnoxious beginning to that that's
so-called Washington Post journalist
what's the so called part of it he wrote
for the Washington Post he was
accomplice for them for a year now you
just want to smear the guy in every
imaginable way and I honestly don't care
who or what he was anyway exactly he was
dismembered by the Saudi government
which seems to be the you know the big
point there so and now finally let's go
to that issue right so these same guys
Pat Robertson Rush Limbaugh Donald Trump
are the ones who told you the Muslims
are the problem we got we got to keep
him out of the country did we figure out
what the hell is going on and I mean
rush limbaugh how many segments that he
knew about the evil Muslims now I would
add fundamentalist Muslims but that's a
distinction we make that's not even a
distinction of Rush Limbaugh or Pat
Robertson makes or Donald Trump but I
mean if you were talking about evil
fundamentalist Muslims it doesn't get
any more so than the Saudi leadership
and so not only it was that the case
before this killing but now Pat
Robertson and Rush Limbaugh are
defending the most extremist Islamic
fundamentalist that just beheaded and
dismembered someone get a load of that
twisted logic and a lot of their
followers are like well of course we're
of course Pro Muslim beheadings haven't
we said that all along
yes is it amazing it is amazing and I
think that this whole story further
proves that the right wing only uses
Muslims for the sole purpose of
fear-mongering that they themselves know
that the general Muslim population
doesn't really serve as a threat to the
United States doesn't serve as a
national security threat to the United
States what they do is exploit people
fear to win elections to spread
propaganda to you know pass
anti-immigration legislation or at least
anti-immigration initiatives and so if
they were really concerned about the
damage that Muslims would do they would
be outraged by this but at the end of
the day it's all about the money it's
all about protecting political interests
it's all about covering up for Trump
helping Trump cover up for the Saudis I
mean it's a really disgusting story
especially when you consider the
precedent it sets for journalists period
I mean this says hey if you're a
journalist the US government will not
look out for you and will not you know
try to get justice on your behalf if you
get murdered by Saudi royals or any
other government especially if there's a
financial interest to keep those ties
yes any government that we profit off of
right and in the case of Donald Trump he
actually has made this clear on several
occasions up to your point about Muslims
in general he said oh the Saudis why
would I be opposed to the Saudis they
pay me forty to fifty million dollars
for apartment of course I'm not going to
be opposed to the Saudis he literally
said that he and if you don't know this
not only the Saudis switch as soon as
Donald Trump won the presidency switch
all their hotel rooms from other hotels
all the Trump properties I mean this
bribery is not is not veiled very much I
know the Saudis are into veiling but
apparently not bad but in some cases
they literally took out hotel rooms
giant blocks of hotel rooms in Trump
hotels and never went there just Prime's
its bribes out in the open and Trump
says why would I be opposed to the
Saudis they keep paying there of course
I'm not opposed to the Saudis oh it's
non rich Muslims that I'd like to fear
monger about while I actually have the
worst of the worst of fundamentalist
Muslims that pay me money so I like them
in fact in this case he said nobody's
told me he's responsible referring to
the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman or
as I'm calling him now bone so Salman he
said nobody's told me he's not
responsible we haven't reached that
point I would love if he wasn't
responsible yep I would love if he
wasn't responsible
now the finally the thing that they're a
little agitated about is that the Saudis
bungled lying so badly
that it's hard to cover up for them
they're dying to cover up for them but
it's may mean a really hard one to the
question I raised originally if you had
the body double why don't you use it as
an alibi like I don't know why they did
the body bonobo and then they didn't use
it maybe think it's just they're like oh
yeah as soon as it happened like oh that
was a really bad idea he's got an
obviously fake beard they immediately
identify who he is right
so I guess scrapped that plan and in the
beginning of course he they said no he
walked out alive and the Saudi officials
officials said that saying no we know
for sure he walked out alive now when
they asked Donald Trump even he had a
tough time justifying that he had to
tell the Washington Post yeah that was
inconsistent you know why they fumbled
it and why they didn't use the body
double because the Turks were
eavesdropping on the whole situation
like they had bugged the room and they
have you know based on what we know and
I am taking it at face value they say
they have the audio recordings of the
whole you know murder basically so and
other evidence tomorrow so if I were you
know with the Saudis if I were Saudi
royalty and I knew all about that all
this I wouldn't go to the body double
because the body double doesn't matter
it's clear that it's a body double if
the Turks have the evidence that they
say they have yeah now we know not only
do they not care about the genocide
happening in Yemen with our weapons they
also don't care about dead journalists
exactly on the go don't worry we got you
covered
