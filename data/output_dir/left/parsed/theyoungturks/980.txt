the goofballs over at FoxNews want to
talk to us about evidence for God check
it out Rodrigo Duterte has defied an
anger the Catholic Church and Christians
worldwide after he said he wouldn't quit
if someone could prove to him that God
exists hello and welcome to a spirited
debate I'm Lauren Greene
Duterte has been in office just two
years but critics say he has become
isolated at home and abroad in part
because of his spat with the church he
not only defined the existence of God
but used expletives to describe the god
of the judeo-christian Bible so is it
worth taking up the Torah taste
challenge or should he just be ignored
and here with his thoughts is dr. alex
macfarlane author director of christian
worldview North Greenville University
welcome Alex well thank you Lauren it's
good to be with you well I hear that
does since then Duterte has actually
apologized to God but I'm interested in
just in you first what your reaction to
all this is well you know he's not the
first person that's been on record sort
of denigrating God or slamming God you
know fifty years ago John Lennon of the
Beatles had to make a Maher culpa for
saying the middle Beatles are bigger
than Jesus and then I don't know 25
years ago or so Ted Turner said we need
to get rid of the Ten Commandments and
have the ten suggestions or 10 voluntary
initiatives and then there was pushback
but at at one point the President of the
Philippines there said God or the idea
of God was stupid but I just read in
prepping for this interview that he's
apologized to God and if that be the
case I'm glad to hear it and hope it was
sincere well maybe he just got a sudden
sense of pragmatism because you know the
Philippines is a largely Catholic nation
and him has as head of state was not
showing a lot of sanity and talking
disparagingly about God well yeah I mean
that's a pretty counterproductive I
would think that if your constituency
loves the Lord then you you better not
maybe you don't love the Lord but at
least you don't want to slam the the
Savior that they believe in but here's
what he said it was interesting in his
apology to God he said I want to be
clear I'm apologizing to God and no one
else he said but the
I believe in my god is all forgiving and
and to that to he or anyone I would say
that is true God is all forgiving but we
have to come to God humbly the Bible
tells us that if we will turn to Jesus
Christ and say Lord I'm sorry for my
sins and I thank you that you paid for
my sins on the cross that Christ will
forgive he can be forgiven duarte or I
was I found that forgiveness at 21 and
so this is a message that we all need to
hear that that God is all forgiving but
we have to come to him humbly and
repentantly well why don't I ask you a
question because he he brings up the
question though but can't can anyone
prove that God exists in a sense in
other words question is you know what
proof is there that if there's a God he
would give you proof that he exists you
know it really becomes this deep
philosophical question and even though
he has apologized the questions to lose
out there is it possible to have an
objective standard to prove that God
exists I think it absolutely is and we
have to qualify what people mean by
proof if they mean a mathematical proof
like we could determine at what
temperature steel melts or something
like that no but you can't
mathematically prove that George
Washington crossed the Delaware but in
in terms of what's called a statistical
proof or the preponderance of evidence
God is an absolutely logical likely
inference creation had to have a creator
design had to have a designer the the
moral law came from a moral lawgiver so
when you look at all that we know about
life the most logical inference and
admission is there is an all-powerful
creator a supernatural eternal God that
is beyond this timely world a timeless
God and creator so I would say yes it is
possible to prove God not in the sense
of a mathematical theorem but in a most
logical conclusion based on all the
observable evidence yeah no okay where
do I begin with this one so first of all
I love
what outrageous people I mean it was
probably duterte is carrying out a
genocide of drug sellers drug users so
you would think that that would get the
bulk of the ire from the media like oh
my goodness he's openly talking about
how regular people should kill drug
users in the street about how you know
people should kill their siblings their
their loved ones if they're drug users
and okay if you don't have the heart to
do it well then just let the cops do it
so and the body count is ticking up man
thousands of people have been murdered
in this drug crackdown this anti drug
crusade and by the way he's also accused
of being addicted to fentanyl the
strongest opioid on the planet so as a
guy is taking drugs and the strongest
drug he's acting like Oh drugs are evil
and drugs are bad and we kill people for
doing drugs so duterte is a menace and I
have zero love for duterte but the thing
about all I'll quit if you prove to me
God exists I'm sure it was an offhanded
comment
I'm sure Duterte is an atheist not an
atheist because he's an intellectual and
he actually you know thought about it
and you know read about the topic no I'm
sure he's an atheist in the same way
that you know my friends uncle is an
atheist which is like he's angry at the
world for whatever reason and he's just
like there can't be a god because I
don't I'm not a happy person there are
there are atheist like that I think we
all have to admit that even though I'm
somebody who's not religious I'm
somebody who's an atheist but yeah I see
different kinds of atheists I see
atheists who are atheists because
they're intellectuals and I see atheists
who are atheist because it's just like
they're angry at what they thought was a
god and so they're like well God might
must not exist because I'm just not
happy so he strikes me as that kind of a
person he's just like an angry dude and
so he's like yeah if you prove God to me
I'll step down that's an easy side thing
to say and just throw it out there
because you know nobody's gonna prove it
to you because it there isn't a god or
at the very least there's no evidence
for a God so
I love how that triggers the media
because as I uh look how arrogant this
guy is stating things that are totally
accurate
that's not I mean what an on bet to make
like okay prove God to me and I'll step
down
nobody ously nobody gonna prove that
it's not even a cut a comment worth
commenting on
so they mentioned how you know oh
there's all these examples of people who
have made similar statements and there
was a backlash who wasn't the Beadle
said they're bigger than Jesus
yeah that's I'm saying we're really
really big it's not them putting down
Jesus although he's acting like he was
interpreted that way I believe it
probably was interpreted that way or Ted
Turner Oh get rid of the Ten
Commandments listen man that shouldn't
even be controversial if you were to
make a list of 10 things that people
should never do that list is like at
least half wrong I pulled them up while
he was talking there you shall have no
other gods before me is one of the
commandments
okay strike one you're out that on the
list if you're making a list of 10
things you should never do that doesn't
make the list you shall have no other
gods before me is the first one you
shall not make for yourself an idol so
don't do idol worship why why some
people when they're growing up they look
at their dad if their dad is a strong
you know figure and provides and teaches
them about life yeah that's my idol my
dad why there's nothing wrong with if
you're a musician and you know whatever
you like we just mentioned the Beatles
if you're a musician oh my god I idolize
the Beatles I want to be like them
people get inspiration from all types
thing what's wrong with that cuz their
idols not God and that's bad it's just
so weird that doesn't make a list of the
10 most important things don't misuse
the name of Lord your God oh please are
we fucking serious and we're three in
and none of them have been good yet
remember the Sabbath day by keeping it
holy for four of them wouldn't make the
list of the 10 most important things
honor your mother and father wrong what
if your mother and father were fucking
murderers what if they're lowlife drug
addicts who never took care of you and
you were raised by your grandma what
about that what about that so stupid
okay here we go finally one that's real
and we're on the sixth one don't murder
yes
that would make the list of the ten most
important things don't commit adultery
that wouldn't make the list of the ten
most important things you shouldn't do
it but you know hey child rape should be
on that list and it's not rape in
general should be on that list it's not
slavery should be on that list and don't
do slavery it's not on the list but they
did find time to say you know don't do
adultery don't steal okay good
you shall shall not give false testimony
against your neighbor okay you shall not
covet anything that belongs to your
neighbor don't fuck your neighbor's wife
I think there's that one but dude listen
come on man
come on the Ten Commandments are totally
outdated they're not a list of the ten
most important things you shouldn't do
just because a few of them are good like
don't murder and don't steal people like
well obviously that's the list of the
things you should never do coming
straight from God know if it was
straight from God ten out of ten would
be the things you definitely shouldn't
do now now let's get to the meat of it
though he says well is it possible to
prove God it's not mathematically
provable okay thank you
that's correct it's not but it is
statistically provable what if you look
at the preponderance of the evidence
what evidence what are you talking about
son and then he says well you know hey
the design had to have a designer listen
here's the deal
that argument falls apart
just by doing a little bit of logical
deduction so okay in order for
everything to look so intricate and in
order for everything that seems so
complex I mean look I have an eye my eye
is capable of seeing what's out there in
the world so what my eye must be so
complex and it's so designed that it
must have a designer or else my eye
wouldn't function properly so the reason
why that's bullshit is any God that
would have done would have had the
ability to do all of this creation
all of this designing make all of this
complex
city that God by definition would have
to be way more complex than this world
the designer has to be way more complex
than the thing that they designed but
then that begs the next question who
designed the designer so if something
this complex had to be designed okay
well then we had a designer but that
designer was also complex in fact even
more complex than us so who designed the
designer and then who designed the
designer of the designer if complex
things need to have a designer then
that's a never-ending chain backwards of
somebody had to design the designer and
then somebody had to design the designer
of the design and then somebody had to
and so on and so forth so that's not an
argument that's not an argument because
it you're actually what they're doing is
and they don't realize it but what
they're doing is scrapping one question
and replacing it with an even harder
question see they think that's an answer
that's not an answer it's the lack of an
answer because you just proposed an even
harder question if something complex
needs a designer well then our designers
even more complex than us so who
designed the designer so now listen I'm
I don't know I don't know the nature of
the universe
I don't know how everything is the way
it is I'm not a fucking genius over here
I just know that what this guy's saying
is bullshit and I think on some level he
knows it's bullshit and if he didn't
know it was bullshit show him this clip
and by the end of it if he's being
honest with himself he'll know that what
he said there was bullshit and the final
point is and this actually is funny that
I'm covering this today because I just
had a run-in with ben shapiro on twitter
about this a few days ago he tweeted
something so ariana grande released a
goofy song like god is a woman
or there's no evidence for God and why
are we even talking about God let's not
talk about a wizard in space that's my
son
no wizards in space no Jigglypuff in
space there's my song Arianny like that
sing that one for me okay so she
releases a song called God is a woman
silly whatever I didn't listen to it I
don't care
ben shapiro takes that song and he you
know tweeted some hashtag and he doesn't
know how to do the hashtags properly
when you do a long hashtag you got to
capitalize the beginning of each letter
or else it gets lost he said something
like god is you know outside of the
Isreal and outside of the realm of space
and time or something like that and then
i responded him and said what happened
to fax over feelings he's the guy I care
about fax over flower expending in a
tweet about God is outside of the
fucking realm we know of but he's
definitely there
that's not fact that's your feeling so
that's what this guy said he goes well
we the preponderance of the evidence
suggests that God is beyond this world
there's literally no way you can know
that because beyond this world is by
definition beyond the world so you're in
the world
you're not beyond the world so to say
like oh gods beyond the world you don't
fucking know what do you dude listen the
only intellectually honest positions are
agnostic and atheist okay agnostic is
just somebody who gives us straight-up
flat-out I don't know I don't know I
don't know
atheist is somebody who says I don't
know but I haven't seen any evidence of
therefore I'm going to might I'm going
to default to no those are the only two
intellectually honest positions if you
deviate from that you're lying to
yourself to yourself it's not about me
it's not about anybody else it's about
you though you're lying to yourself if
you do that so anyway that's my long
segment here but Fox News talking about
God in 2018 and doing this thing where
they're pretending to be serious well it
may not be mathematically provable but
the preponderance of the evidence
suggested it's statistically possible
fuck off fuck off that's not you're not
making any sense and you probably know
it on some level
