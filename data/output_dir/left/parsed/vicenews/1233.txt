the decision Donald Trump met with
Mahmoud Abbas the President of the
Palestinian Authority in Washington
today it's the latest American effort to
restart meaningful peace negotiations
I've always heard that perhaps the
toughest deal to make is the deal
between the Israelis and the
Palestinians let's see if we can prove
them wrong okay good well both
presidents want to be peace in the
future
the key question now is how much
influence Abbas has at home çb
Greenwood has more method Abbas has many
titles as chairman of the PLO he
represents Palestine on the
international stage at least nominally
in with elected president of the
Palestinian Authority which covers the
West Bank in 2005 but as has not been
another election system that democratic
legitimacy strictly speaking run out
seven years ago it also had as a
fatality movement but he's facing a
growing leadership threat from Marwan
Barghouti a charismatic figure currently
leading thousands of Palestinian
prisoners and a hunger strikes in

Palestinian president it's challenged by
Hamas a rival faction that controls the
Gaza Strip this week the Hamas
leadership unveiled a new manifestos
backtracking from its founding principle
that rejected the existence of the State
of Israel a bus might present this new
softer Hamas as a result of his
influence he has recently been exerting
pressure on Hamas in Gaza cutting
salaries government officials and
refusing to pay gases electricity bill
to Israel
which means that 1.8 million people now
face 24-hour power cuts but the new
formats manifesto is really the product
of four years of complex negotiation and
debate within that movement in Palestine
Trump is widely considered to be the
most Pro Israeli US president today even
if he does manage to negotiate the
ultimate deal with a bath would Abbas
have the popularity or legitimacy to
make it stick in Palestine at least to
mainstream Republicans announced today
that they'll back the GOP health care
bill after all the ball is back in the
moderate court after the hardliners got
on board last week for the past two
years the freedom caucus three dozen
most conservative members of the House
has banded together to buck their own
party and reject any legislation that
isn't deeply read
they've been blocking the Obamacare
replacement bill but then they abruptly
dropped most of their demands and agreed
to accept it after House leaders added
an amendment letting States opt out of
certain coverage requirements it's a
jarring reversal for the freedom caucus
it's also their only way forward
Alexandra Jaffe reports the house
freedom caucus has always stood out for
standing on principle until last week
that's when the most principled group in
Washington succumb to politics and got
on board with the latest version of
health care reform
we think we made a build much better
it's not full revealed I'll be honest
it's not but it is as good as we think
we can get right now it's what their
party leaders were pushing for and it
marked a compromise one that left parts
of Obamacare intact in hopes of getting
moderates on board
that's how legislating and Washington
typically works but it's not how the
freedom caucus typically works it's
actually completely contradictory to
what two of the group's most prominent
members told us about health care reform
when we were home with them in their
districts a couple of weeks ago Jim
Jordan and Mark Sanford represent very
different district Jordan and Mid Ohio
and Stanford the South Carolina coast
and don't have much in common but they
had similar complaints about the
original Republican health care bill
Jordan said freedom caucus members
opposed that bill unprincipled and also
because of the process we're doing what
we told the voters we're going to do
everyone knows this health care bill
doesn't fully repeal Obamacare and in
the end the test will be do premiums
actually come down Obamacare is still
the law of the land though and if you
don't figure out a way to compromise
with moderates on your bill it may be
for the foreseeable future I mean isn't
that a failure of the house freedom
caucus we got time you know the only
thing worse than not getting it done is
doing it wrong and a good process
typically we make good policy and good
policy makes for good politics and we
have a process where the bill is hidden
away rolled out no actual hearings where
you bring in witnesses that's not how
it's supposed to work so in late March
they join together to stop the bill
you have some photos they do not have
the votes right now helping is relatable
to get you guys on I doubt it
are you doing stunts like be you have
given the group a reputation for
obstruction which they embraced that's
basically how Sanford described it the
freedom caucus has had more success in
blocking bill so than passing them so
how do you achieve that any goal if you
don't get any of your own legislation
passed one of the most important things
that we can do in any legislative
process is at times stop things there is
a bias is we both know toward quote
doing something in the world of
government the question is can we be
more contemplatively in that process so
that what we do actually has a positive
impact in people's lives and doesn't
come with a whole host of unintended
consequences creating gridlock worked
for the freedom caucus well Barack Obama
was in office but now with full GOP
control of Washington they have a chance
to pass to open policies and obstructing
those policies is making them enemies
within their party the president even
threatened a primary them Stanford joked
about that threat with a public high
school it doesn't make your day when the
president I say says I'm going to take
you out in the next you know primary
that they're lying on it not a good day
but a I be as best I could tell his
attention span is relatively short and
and so you know I'm hoping that maybe
you'll forget about that and go on
something else but voters are getting
set up they want politicians with
integrity and action all sort of health
care yet why do you want to push this so
fast on the health care issue
repealed every place but guaranteed
competition back into the marketplace it
has been incredibly difficult for our
health care organizations to manage
their only business because of the way
politics and policy has been conducted
in the last year and 100 percent of the
locations in the whole town there's how
socialized health care understand I'm
going to come back in but all I can is
anything a little because we were
compassionate I don't Canada most
stringent if I got everybody facts about
no one here to person some things I got
it you wouldn't have hearing about it
all at all I've heard about over the
last week is health care I got that
pressure is part of the reason they went
back on all those declarations about
public hearings and full Obamacare
repeal and endorsed the latest build
compromising is a new thing for the
freedom caucus they don't know if it'll
pay off the back in DC this week they
seemed pretty comfortable with it at
least for now I'm willing to stand up
and fight for exactly what I told you I
was going to fight for you know because
I think it's the right thing to do but
when we get the best deal I think we can
get and it's moving the ball down the
field in a constructive way we're
willing to support that with the idea
that we have more work to do Sanford
though acknowledged the group accepted a
bill that was less than perfect because
they had to but when we talk to you said
that there was a role for the freedom
caucus and conservatives in general from
preventing imperfect laws from being
pressed it's a bad bill the same way the
last one was for a number of reasons
so why support it now I suspected in
part there's a limited bandwidth to
dealing with any one issue in the United
States Congress
I mean to be constructively engaged in
the process of deliberation at some
point you got to find a way to either
get the yes but yes with 3/4 or yes with
1/2 and for me I've made my peace saying
okay this federalism model bill not
perfect and though not a full repeal is
the best that we can get out of this
Congress at this time and I'm willing to
go with it during the Republican
presidential primary white evangelical
conservatives could have chosen one of
their own what they skipped all the
familiar faces 2 Corinthians 3:17 that's
the whole ball game
Trump rewarded them by bringing on Mike
Pence as his vice president one of the
most beloved figures in white
evangelical politics but what the white
evangelical conservatives actually want
tends to do we might find out this week
tomorrow's the National Day of Prayer a
political religious event that started
1952 with an act of Congress and a
signature from President Harry Truman
presidents generally used this day to
make broad appeal so nation's vast
religious community but this White House
has been kicking around an idea that
will appeal to the specific Evangelic
conservatives that stood up for
President Trump an executive order
protecting religious freedom
tomorrow's National Day of Prayer could
it be a great way to release it it would
be a moment where vice president
Pensions influence could really shine as
has been
of white evangelical tourism for his
entire political career and he's still
doing it he was the first vice president
to ever show up at the March for Life
when he appeared there earlier this year
the first time we heard about an
executive order protecting religious
freedom back in February there was a
huge outcry from LGBT advocates they
feared an order that would make it
easier for people to discriminate
against them they protested the order
didn't get signed but this time might be
different we haven't seen language of an
executive order yet but evangelical
groups know what they want
I hope the kim colby senior counsel at
the center for law and religious freedom
about what her group wants to see you
can president Trump I think all of the
spots of the initial executive orders
about travel and other things just did
not go through the process because he
was in such a hurry to do certain things
I would hope that it's a good site
executive order that's been vetted by
many people inside the administration
not like the first few executive orders
evangelical Christians have felt a
little bit under siege in the past few
years yeah things that we never thought
could happen in a free country has
happened to individuals does it feel
like now you have the power to push back
on that the power shouldn't be used to
hurt anyone but the power should be used
to create a safe and I think that's what
I hope the executive order does is make
sure that religious freedom and free
speech and all of our first to memorize
Free Press are all really strong so that
regardless of who's in power whether
whether your views are popular or not or
in power or not
you're protected and that's what we're
aiming for

political dynasty albeit one that's
never actually held national power in
1972 her father John marine lepen
co-founded front Nationale the
race-baiting party that's been its first
decade in the political wilderness often
struggling to gather the 500 signatures
required to even get on the French
ballot but it did motivated opponents to
violence in 1976 the lepen family home
was bombed no one was injured and no
suspects were ever found
but for marine only eight at the time
the event was the beginning of her
political awakening the family moved to
