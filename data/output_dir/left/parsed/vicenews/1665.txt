government forces began fighting
russian-backed separatists in eastern
Ukraine
the war have left over 9,000 death and
million civilians displaced and whole
towns and villages in ruins with no
clear end in sight to the fighting we
went to Ukraine to see the heavy toll
that the conflict has had and on
soldiers and civilians over the course
of the war thousands of Ukrainian
soldiers have been wounded so far this

the Ukrainian healthcare system was

prepared to treat the widespread
psychological trauma from the wall
this lack of treatment access has been

Ukrainian soldiers with psychological

over 200,000 soldiers many of them
volunteers have served in the East this
unprecedented military enrollment and
outdated record-keeping systems has
meant thousands of veterans are
struggling to receive the benefits they
were promised making the return to
civilian life much more difficult

the only ones thousands of veterans
across Ukraine have fallen through the
cracks and struggled to get the
government support that they need we
spoke with our two derevyanko the head
of the office of Veteran Affairs to find
out why the government response has been
so sluggish one of the the main
complaints that we've had from soldiers
who fought in the East is that they face
very lengthy and complicated efforts to
get their veteran status why is that

so is there pressure from your ministry
on the military to try and streamline
this process for the soldiers because if
the problem is the middle management in
these units that obviously needs to
change else these soldiers are going to
still be stuck in this process and if
they do suffer from psychological trauma
it's only gonna get worse if they can't

thousands of families have lost sons
brothers and fathers to the conflict
with many believing that the blame for
those losses extends way beyond the army
simply not being ready for the wall on
the 15th of June 2014 Ukrainian military
transport plane was shot down by
separatist forces in the gans killing 49
soldiers even though commanding officers
knew the separatists in the area had
anti-air missiles they still gave the
order to fly with legal assistance from
for post and volunteer lawyers the
families of the deceased soldiers are
taking action and suing the general
responsible for negligence what's the

dealing with the failures of the
government is hard enough when you live
in an area under government rule but
life is even harder for those who live
in frontline villages that receive
little help from the Ukrainian or
separatist authorities
about once a month to meet you Jana from
four posts come to the 8th ozone to
offer their services to soldiers and
civilians fighting and living on the
frontlines we're heading to the village

another infamous frontline village is
Piske where unlike sites over the
majority the civilians have long since
fled because of their heavy fighting
she's been completely destroyed by the
fighting is hard to imagine that we're
in Europe there's two ceasefires never
actually stopped the fighting completely
just sort of enforced a stalemate with
both sides sitting in trenches lobbying
artillery each other and although the
fighting is a lot quieter these days
people are still dying here and the
trauma of the fighting is still
continuing to affect the soldiers a
number of frontline positions are still
manned by volunteer battalions that fall
outside of the control of the Ukrainian
Armed Forces these volunteers are often
unpaid and on eligible for the veteran
status and the associated benefits
jelena from for post is meeting with
fighters from one of these battalions at
the organization of Ukrainian
nationalists to evaluate a psychological

in the two years since the Euro Maidan
revolution the government has failed to
enact the democratic reforms that people
fought and died for
this lack of change has led these men to
doubt their sacrifice and threaten to
turn their frustrations on the
government with the conflict now in a
stalemate Ukraine has a chance to
effectively tackle the issues plaguing
its veterans but if the conflict heats
up again there's a real risk the focus
will shift back to the fighting and more
soldiers and civilians could be lost to
the trauma of the war
