so we've just arrived in Athens and
walked into the middle of an enormous
protest of course we did it's happens
this is a place where the economic and
the societal problems are still so bad
the protests are basically weekly but
imagine being from a place that was so
messed up do you risk your life and your
liberties just to get here in 2014
médecins some frontier visited holding
camps for migrants and asylum seekers
retained in Greece they described what
they saw as a living hell full of
disease overcrowding and grotesque filth
sadly it's not that surprising the
Greeks have a weird relationship with
immigration in fact until recently this
was a country that allowed a neo-nazi
party the Golden Dawn the sit in
Parliament part of the problem is that
for a lot of refugees the country is a
gateway to the rest of the EU meaning
that recently many people have come from
places like Libya Egypt Pakistan
Afghanistan and Syria looking for the
European dream only to get stuck in
Greece there they face violence and
often exploitation in April 2013 in a
small strawberry farm near a town called
Mann Alana a group of immigrants went on
strike to protest poor pay conditions
during the protest over 30 of them were
shot by their employer
after that stories began to service of
slave-like conditions and armed guards
on motorbikes in Athens at a protest for
immigrant workers rights
we met Javad as LOM the president of the
Pakistani Workers Association who said
he had something he wanted to show us so
showboat has taken us to a place called
Kinoshita which is home to about 3,000
immigrants and a couple of nights ago
some people the shove-it knows were
attacked by the Golden Dawn
how many racial attacks are there in
Athens from last year two and half year
old eight to nine hundred in last three
days around about 15 to 20 peoples are
injured and these are those people's you
can see so the these are everyone there
was a time yes yes more than 15 persons
was beaten we were driven into the
middle of a tiny village just outside
Athens the day before schibetta told us
three Pakistani men had been attacked
the three men were now staying in a safe
house surrounded by their mates young
man says they came inside our house with
broken windows and they start to beat us
with stones with iron rods they beat us
very badly and so I had her head on the
side is your arm broken yes what
injuries do you have don't move the
herzman they throw down from the
upstairs they threw you downstairs
yes so you your nose go ahead the boy do
you feel like the the immigrants in
other places in Europe have a better
time than people in Greece yes of course
they are not facing us like these very
bad injuries and very fearful every day
and
when we are going to our job we are not
thinking we can return back to our
houses safely what we can do if the
government is not going to stop them how
we can stop it
who will give me the justice who will
protect me about these attacks those
three guys down there who's so scared
I've been beaten so badly I kind of
trapped between a rock and a hard place
because obviously Greece is a horrible
place to pee right now and they're
getting beat up by neo-nazis and
obviously Greece doesn't really have the
money or the jobs to withstand this
amount of immigration so it just does
seem like an impossible situation the
collapse of the economy and the rise of
the far-right have meant that these guys
lives turned into hell while we were in
here talking to those guys our producer
was out front in the car and a great guy
came up and started taking photos of the
number plate and basically telling us to
get the hell out telling us that these
guys are scumbags and we get raped if
we're winning here and generally being
quite threatening we've been in town
what 15 minutes in your opinion when an
immigrant is attack did they get as much
support from the law courts as a Greek
would say Lima catechist area in a very

collapse on the presence of migrant
workers actually the Greek economy was
propped up upon the shoulders of these
migrant workers annoyed opposed no
so we're heading south towards malla
lada a place which is home to some of
europe's most delicious most juicy and
most valuable strawberries but if room
is to be believed it's also home to some
of the least privileged and least well
paid workers in the Western world now
everything we've heard about this place
is really intimidating heard stories of
immigrants being shot we've heard
stories of journalists being beaten up
with heard stories of photographers
being threatened with guns but for going
there anyway
we're gonna see for ourselves and maybe
see what life's like for some of
Europe's last slaves agricultural
exports play a big role in Greece's
economy for example about 30,000 tons of
strawberries are produced yearly but
only about 12% are consumed locally yet
despite the size of the business few
Greeks are employed in the fields
instead the industry is carried on the
backs of immigrants living around manna
Lada or a few activists who campaign for
the rights of the farmhand we met one
who'd been threatened so badly that she
was scared to visit the farms anymore or
even reveal her identity how regular
have you been down to the farms to be on
the board monopoly to the brain function

in this problem so we drive in tamanna
Laden alley for my strawberry fields and
I'm gonna meet a guy who works there
and I talked to him about what it's like
to live and work there and if it's
possible we're gonna get into have a
look at it
we'd arranged to me to worker from the
man a lot of farms inside the nearby
town but we're told to hide our cameras
it was all very clandestine and paranoid
but eventually our contact agreed to
take us into the farms themselves Kester

but Paddington
I get in this game guys trying to turn
the cars around tells us being in the
club so this is that this is the field
where the workers of man a lot of work
and it's pretty grim man it's like a
refugee camp only these guys are
actually working and a large amount of
their money every week goes on renting
these places to stay in this camp we saw
no water electricity toilets or showers
and it's just one of many the fruit
fields go on for miles and each one has
to be worked on by scores of men I've
counted 12 of these big things and
there's between 10 and 25 men staying in
each of them
that means there's about 300 people here
in this tiny spot in these plastic cages
this is in Europe this is in mainland
Central Europe it's like walking into a
country it's pretty unbelievable stuff
you know just the kitchen yeah okay this
is the kitchen pretty basic fire going
on a lot of firewood sweet kitchen do I
think the roof won't catch fire you
might want to watch out on that

from the back of this camp are the vines
which they work on and as fields and
fields and fields in them
this is the laborer upon which Greece is
supporting his economy at the moment and
the enormous amount of money that people
are getting from selling strawberries to
Europeans was not coming back to these
guys all right they do have a mosque
here so we're gonna go and have a look
at that is this you okay so this is this
is where you pray do you pray to leave
man a letter do you pray for life for
life
okay so we've only been here for about
25 minutes but we're being told it's
time to go time to move on in case the
boss has come back and that won't be
good
they're like refugee camps they're like
something you expect to see people
living in outside war-torn countries
they're not the kind of thing you expect
manual laborers in the Western world in
2013 to be living in 25 men to a tiny
room ten men to room half the size of my
bedroom
the conditions are unbelievable and all
the money is coming out of those people
their hard work and their suffering is
it's kind of somewhere else I guess it's
going to houses like this and all the
strawberries they're picking are going
in fat European mouths like mine all
over the West for those farmers in the
region who had nothing to do with the
shootings the PR surrounding them has
been disastrous

kappakappa Episode VII Daniel a
microphone last three of the other
opening segment I never deny with the
quality of life solo many immigrants the
grease quickly realized the country
isn't the land of opportunity their
first believed it to be and a desperate
to escape into Western Europe doing this
without getting caught and kicked back
into the country they were first so
desperate to escape isn't easy though
last year more than 1,500 illegal
immigrants were caught in Patras for
immigrants hoping to get into Western
Europe is the best bet with boats
leaving for Italy every day we'd heard
that the most common way to smuggle
themselves onboard ships was either by
sneaking into the cargo or more commonly
waiting at traffic lights for trucks to
stop climbing beneath them and holding
on as they drove off this though is both
hard and dangerous so many immigrants
were left in Patras for months or years
every day tried to find an opportunity
to escape as such for many immigrants
Patras has become a place of limbo and
life there is just a constant struggle
to get out okay so behind me is this
enormous warehouse where apparently
loads of the migrants in the area live
we were told that we'd be able to film
in there so we went to try and get in
and two guys came up and stopped us and
said don't come in don't come in they
were saying that they'd been a massive
fight there a couple of days ago but the
two guys are going to talk to us so
we'll see what I have to say do you live
around here
no no just a little meow

see it's not good
so we've just walking off the main road
took a left just I kind of have a poke
around so a couple of guys started talk
to them and they've taken us here this
bridge they've built through the sewer
it's like an assault course and if you
slip up you fall in what are those
smells like a toilet
 so this is just off the main road
like we just turned a corner randomly
we've walked into this kind of amazing

know how long have you lived here -
month two months are you staying in
Patras so that you can get on the boats
to do Italy by container by the bus okay
you don't so you get down any when
inside the ship sit down and the 16
hours 20 hours without food without
drink okay you know it's not good when
you sleep you die yeah yes have you ever
held on yes but you got caught
yes police caught me and commandos
taught me it's not good I know it's not
with this bad is illegal but what I can
do I have no papers one of your friends
was saying that please sometimes come
here and make the people police sometime
comes here and thoughts many people's
really what do they say they just say do
they hate you the register st they said
to go to Afghanistan go to Pakistan what
Afghanistan too much problem but he can
do he's coming here for earning well
good future
yeah but you get to go to UK it's worth
risking your life to get out of Greece
and get to the UK
okay thanks very much no problem yours
nephews walking around the ports of
Patras it's impossible not to notice
just how many people are looking for
their chance to escape the country with
the fences the rocks the sea and the
guards standing in their way it's easy
to see why so few people actually
achieve this there's a certain sad irony
and the idea that people try for so long
to get to Greece but when they get here
they realize they don't want to stay
they don't want to stay because the
economy is botched they don't a stay
because the police hate them they don't
want to stay because the Golden Dawn
make their lives misery in fact the only
people who welcomed the migrants into
the country are those who want to
exploit them in the fields like the ones
that we've seen I guess that's why so
many people spend so long trying to get
the hell out of this
