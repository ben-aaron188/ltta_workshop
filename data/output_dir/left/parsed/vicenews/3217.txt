machine gun is on every building along
our roof and also an illegal escape from
North Korea
no one knows where it's going but we'll
be there uncovering the news culture
expose the absurdity of the modern
condition

I was interviewing suicide bombers and
they were kids this is the world to

hi I'm Shane Smith we're here in the
Vice offices in Brooklyn New York and
for our first story this week we go to
Asia North Korea is one of the worst
places on earth its population suffers
from political oppression intense
poverty and starvation so it's no wonder
that every year thousands of people try
to escape the country now getting out is
hard enough but getting to a safe place
as it turns out is even harder so we
sent Thomas to meet a group of defectors
as they flee from there the country Kim
has betrayed is North Korea we can't
show her face because if the North
Korean government finds out she's
escaped both Kim and her family could
spend the rest of their lives in prison
camp which ironically enough is one of
the many reasons people want to get the
hell out of that to escape North Korea
you can't just slip across the border
into South Korea that is unless you're
willing to cross an eight mile strip of
land
North Korean cards with orders to shoot
to kill so most defectors head for China
but China is still dangerous to the
Chinese government refuses to give North
Koreans refugee status in part because
it sees North Korea as a buffer between
its own country in the american-backed
South Korea so if a North Korean is
caught in China they get sent right back
where they came from those who don't get
caught have to rely on a network of
human traffickers and brokers to guide
them out of that country to freedom
provided they don't just sell them into
a life of sexual bondage instead which
they often do that's where pastor Kim
comes in for the past 16 years he's been
wading into this black market and
plucking North Koreans from its horny
clutches and for no personal game other
than winning souls for the glory of God
the Father Almighty in fact many of his
congregants are North Koreans he helped
escape his latest rescue mission is our
girl camp no one did it a caucus or

it out paradise aw poor ji GAE
how about door more could her I'm Teddy
with them or you had her skin and a puny
do not doubt so wait I'm sorry the the
pit made you pay for her abortion yeah
that was the first in a series of shady
deals the pastor
make in order to get camp a 23 year old
potato farm round freedom the next was
paying to have her smuggle to a safe
house in Eng China since being seen
there with a bunch of foreigners my
blower escaped we sent our Korean
translator with a small camera the meter
since escaping her pimp Kim has been
holed up in his safe house with three
other North Korean women who reach sold
his Brides to Chinese men the pastor is
also bankrolling their escape with their
heads to toe back at the church the
pastor laid out his plan to get to South
Korea the girls have to take bus several
thousand miles to the southern Chinese
border then sneak into Laos that's where
we'll meet them and watch their smuggled
across the Mekong River into Thailand
the nearest place that recognized a
refugee status rather than their even
near an oligarch kinesin your banister
so
once we got word that Kim the other
North Koreans it started their way south
we headed to Laos this is obviously the
most sketchy part of the trip
hey because it is human trafficking it
also because these guys get caught the
defectors are starting to get a
little ill it is finally we met Kim this
is her first time meeting a foreigner oh
okay one of the good kid
hooting this others don't get it it's
had a most happy but know what I can do

speeding down winding Laotian mountain
roads which is especially nauseating for
cam and the others considering this is
only the third or fourth time they've
ever been in a car all this effort all
this money just to get four nice young
ladies out of a country that can't feed
them doesn't have any opportunities for
them and stuff to somewhere that at
least it lip service the idea of wanting

once off the boat the girls help hide
themselves to avoid being spotted by
passing now we have to rush back across
the Mekong River before the next Border
Patrol passes so that we can legally
re-enter Thailand to meet up with the
girls the bad news is the girls have
been caught the good news is they were
caught by Thai police who won't send
them back to North Korea they're Baja
right behind this little flake he's a

actually and there's a hole here that
peeled them passing stuff through ouch
speaks Thai Thai security around these
parts hey Kim hey um how are you are you
okay
from here they have to wait on a
representative from the South Korean
embassy who who via the diplomatic
alchemy of handing them a passport will
turn Kim and the other girls from North
Koreans to South Koreans but even on the
home stretch to her own freedom which
granted his tie jail Kim is just

we'll keep on winning
now I grew up at the end of the Cold War
which was essentially America and its
allies had half of the world and the
Soviet Union and its allies had the
other half both countries had massive
nuclear arsenals and for 50 years stood
toe-to-toe on the brink of all-out war
the only thing that really held them
back was mad otherwise known as mutually
assured destruction quite simply put if
one side launches an attack so does the
other and the final result is we all die
end of story and because the end of the
world was such a good deterrent the Cold
War ended peacefully in 1991 however the
lunacy of mutually assured destruction
didn't go away at all it just relocated
the most dangerous place in the world
today I think you could argue as the
Indian subcontinent in the line of
control and Kashmir now Kashmir has been
in the news a lot lately with escalating
tensions between India and Pakistan so
we went to cashmeres line of control to
see just how bad this conflict is
getting
we're here by Gaston
because everyone is always talking about
Pakistan gives our capabilities and
everyone is terrified by them but we
also have new us not because the
alternative is a subcontinent that no
longer exists really really hate each
other now this antagonism started when
Mahatma Gandhi finally succeeded in
gaining independence from Great Britain
and in the ensuing chaos of building a
new state India's Muslims insisted on
trading Rome countries as a consequence
millions of Hindus and Sikhs fled to
India and simultaneously millions of
India's Muslims migrated to the newly
created Pakistan now during this
partition tens of millions of people
were relocated and in the process over a
million people on both sides of the
migration were murdered in brutal
religious violence India Pakistan have
been fighting ever since the flash point
of this lingering conflict is Kashmir a
mostly Muslim region that is partially
occupied by the Indian state and you
don't have to be in Kashmir long to
realise that emotions are running
extremely high as was explained to us by
a Kashmiri political leader they eat
Alisha gelatinous
we are facing the worst kind of sit
eight terrorists under the occupation of
Indian forces and killings by the police
and drove by the popular forces is a
continuous process this is all
consequencies operation we wanted to
talk to these Palmilla forces so we went
north to the highly militarized area
closer to the border this is one of the
main entrances from Pakistan into India
it's one of the most heavily militarized
zones in all of India and the
demographics of the idea they have found
a very soft corner here and right
conducive environment for the
flourishing the reason why this is such
a militant superhighway is because a is
so close to Pakistan be the terrain
makes it almost impossible to police and
see because Pakistan continues to Train
militants and sneak them into India with
the soil intent to destabilize the
region so the line of control is not the
border it's not a border no it's a
temporal eggman between India and
Pakistan so if they get through the line
of control then you have to catch them
when they hit the hinterland then it
becomes our job eliminating the
terrorists and whose training
reportedly is a and the police enemy so
the Pakistan Army and the ISI our
training insurgents and sneaking them
into India to create unrest terroristic
geureon insurgency
India has good reason to fear these
pakistani-based terrorists because in
2008 they attacked Mumbai and kill 106
people needed hundreds more and held the
city hostage for more than 60 hours
Indians refer to it as the reaction in
India was nearly as intense and very
very active participant tens of thousand
to the streets calling Frollo remarkably
the Indian government showed restraint
did not attack Pakistan in retaliation
but tensions between the two countries
remain severely strained as was
explained to us by a leading Indian
defense expert Ajay Sonny
Pakistan continues to be the principal
supporter of a range of terrorist
organizations mobilized on the basis of
an Islamist extremist ideology and the
fact that it is backed by the state
apparatus of Pakistan is what makes it
so dangerous for India now technically
Kashmir falls into the legal claim for
India it is challenged on these faces of
the majoritarian mostly majorities and
Muslims I don't think in I think this
enemy T is and will remain irreducible
until Pakistan undergoes a complete
cultural transformations and I do not
believe that there is anything within
the tide
sorry going up into the Himalayas now
this road leads to the LOC the line of
control is very hot zone and we're
hoping someone doesn't love a grenade in
Turtles
and actually as I was stupidly making
jokes about someone throwing grenades
the real terrorist threat was detected
and counter-terrorist procedures were
immediately implemented
you've got information regarding
presence of some militants here we cover
all the areas from where you can
possibly draw some fire let's go it is
the main infiltration route as you can
see the terrain is unmanageable right
very steep slopes
it is forest and they make use of this
geography and they sneak informative how
do they get across I think it's your
motivation on their part and the
brainwashing that is done the camps
after we were given the all-clear we
continued on our way to the Indian side
of the line of control over there is
Pakistan this is the line of control
we're going over to the bridge we had to
take off our military here because it's
seen as an insult
there's Rangers over there trained they
said if you go out on the bridge and you
go one step too far they'll shoot you
now to us it seemed all very quiet and
peaceful for supposedly the most heavy
place on earth but then our Indian
guards pointed out all the bunkers and
positions that the Pakistani Rangers had
set up on the mountains and we were like
oh so there's bunkers all over there
look look oh I see there yeah and their
guns
so this is the zero line right here in
between India and Pakistan if I go on
that side I can say goodbye to my toes
I'm not gonna go on that side you
wouldn't think it's one of the most
dangerous borders in the world because
when you look up it's just shockingly
beautiful so India has nearly a million
troops in Kashmir and a massive nuclear
arsenal
22 Pakistan's and after the Mumbai
attacks about quite publicly never again
but the ISI and the Pakistani army to
keep sending insurgents across the
border with the sole purpose of causing
chaos within India and they send them
almost every day
now this constant badgering seems insane
so we went to Pakistan see first hand
while he seemed so hell-bent on
continuing this conflict the first
person we talked to when we arrived was
dr. Perez Hoodbhoy a leading nuclear
scientist and what he told us didn't
make us feel any better you have
Pakistan openly training and sending in
militants into Kashmir and you have the
Indians who if they suffer another
Mumbai saying we don't know if we can
hold back what do you think about that
well what you're saying is a doomsday
scenario yeah okay nuclear weapons then
come into play but let me say that the
Indian establishment does realize that a
war with Pakistan this line would be
devastating it would be fatal
catastrophic for both countries which
brings us to the growing radicalization
within Pakistan there is still a lot of
anti Indian feeling within the Pakistani
military it's it's seen as something
that's very unifying so the radicals and
ordinary officers and men they are
united in this that yes
India's our enemy until we get out of
this is gonna be it's going to get worse
most countries of the world have armies
Pakistan has an army that has a country
and it is now in terrible trouble it is
being attacked by the jihadis which it
helped create the general headquarters
of the Pakistan Army has been attacked
three ISI centers have been blown up by
suicide bombers and this was done using
insider information so radicalization is
now eating into its very marrow
according to dr. hood boy what is even
more troubling than the radicalization
within the Army is that the Pakistani
state is actually losing control over
huge swathes of its own territory he
recommended we go to some of these
to see for ourselves just how bad she
headed to Northwest Frontier Province
the home of the Pakistani Taliban
we're leaving the bathroom for now which
used to be in 2008 the only part of the
whole area that the Pakistani army
controlled just the fort now just to be
clear when we say the Pakistani army
only control of the fourth that means
the rest of the province terrorists
Taliban's right they were living over
there and they were dominating this
entire village they would be training
here and then if anything happened they
could hide in the caves
definitely so we're gonna go in the
caves now but so they dug these caves
yesterday these kids that's a lot of
work yes there was a lot of work and how
many cave complexes like this are there
dozens of complexes exist it's like when
they used to say in America that they
couldn't find Osama bin Laden because he
was in cave we didn't understand what
cave is for us a cave is like you know
with a bear in it but these are tunnels
and whole complex well-knit together
yeah now the Taliban have been operating
a Pakistan for quite some time in fact
the quote-unquote father of the Taliban
is actually a Pakistani general
who was once head of the ISI which is
kind of like the FBI the CIA and the NSA
all rolled into one which made him at
one point one of the most powerful men
in Pakistan now his views on the
radicalization of the army were quite
unexpected
as he quickly brought all of these
seemingly internal problems right back
to the conflict with India the Army is
being pushed around and it is losing its
direction America is forcing us to shift
our forces from the eastern border to
the western border called reversing the
front that there is the enemy but you
reverse it so there is the enemy India
but we're reversing to our front you've
been called the father of the Taliban
because you helped set up the jihadis
who would fight against the Soviets but
of course the jihad is I supported run
trauma bin Laden was very sort of a
genial kind of a man a bit shy
intelligence will go to realize flashing
black eyes after the Mumbai attack there
was such a huge sort of nationalistic
outpouring in India aren't you worried
that if you keep sending militants into
Kashmir or something that there'll be
another attack Kashmir is a festering
sore for us since 1971 there were
several occasions when there was a call
for war but they didn't do this because
they know what will be the price more
will be the price they cannot attack us
because we are nuclear yeah and they
cannot attack us because we are imbued
with the spirit of jihad which has
defeated two superpowers in our
neighborhood and without settling the
Kashmir dispute the peace cannot return
to subcontinent right India or Pakistan
so I think Indians must come to their
senses they are not understanding the
course of history after talking to
general pool we thought things in
Kashmir
in this is water in Kashmir is majority
of Pakistan's water of Kashmir is the
majority of India's water it's already
highly politicized as the most
militarized area in the world what are
your thoughts on that nope this country
was twenty seven million and came into
existence in 1947 today it is almost 200
million it's leading to water becoming a
very scarce resource and these are the
things that we really have to be afraid
of you've had this sort of political
perfect storm of Pakistan radicalizing
and then India at the same time sort of
hardening up we might be able to get
some kind of handle on our disputes what
is something that you need and something
we need and so let's figure out a decent
way of of doing this without going to
war nobody is going to give away a piece
of land and people just because somebody
else asks
like what is the worst-case scenario
what what what what happens you know the
worst case scenario is what Carl Sagan
told us a long time ago the planet will
no longer be blue anymore do you do you
think that Pakistan is in a state of
denial oh yes most certainly it's in a
state of denial and there is absolutely
no guarantee that it will come out of
this if one had been used then you can
bet that all of them I have no doubt in
my mind there would have to be nuclear
attack here everyone seems to think that
it's more a question of when not with
India Pakistan have hundreds of war
that's pointing at each other and things
to seem to be going from bad to worse
now the problem is is that if India
Pakistan go to war it doesn't just mean
the destruction of the subcontinent
because leading atomic experts have
categorically stated
over a hundred warheads are detonated
anywhere on earth it means the
destruction of the world as Manila
whole mountains of ice are just falling
into the sea we're in for trouble indeed
this is where the Soviets tested all
their weapons so this is the epicenter
of it nuclear bomb the last six months
you have 9000 I easy that's an IUD
once you get someone in they can never
leave even police helicopters don't dare
fly over here because two years ago one
was shot down by an anti-aircraft gun
fun place to live
okay let's get out of here
