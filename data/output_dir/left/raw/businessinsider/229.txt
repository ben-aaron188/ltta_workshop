1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,840
"North Korea launched another intercontinental ballistic missile."

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,560
"People were told to take cover in basements or in concrete buildings."

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:14,020
"Could this kind of missile now reach cities on the East Coast, possibly New York or D.C.?"

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,420
What would happen if North Korea launched a nuclear weapon?

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,735
U.S. officials think North Korea has as many as 60 nuclear weapons in its arsenal.

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,760
And tensions between the two countries have escalated to new levels during the Donald Trump presidency.

7
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:32,285
Remember when Trump compared the size of their nuclear buttons?

8
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:35,885
So, how close are we to an actual nuclear war?

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,420
It’s closer than you might think.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,500
The U.S. is reportedly considering a "bloody nose" attack on North Korea.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,740
This could include a manned airstrike or shooting down a missile test launch.

12
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,180
Basically, a warning shot intended to humiliate North Korea.

13
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,960
But this warning could be taken as an act of war.

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,620
Jeffrey Lewis is an expert on disarmament, arms control and nonproliferation.

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,460
He thinks the "bloody nose" tactic could lead to disaster.

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:09,160
The way I think of it is — the problem with the bloody nose approach is imagine if you saw a guy holding a gun.

17
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,720
Like if you walk up and punch him in the nose, he might very well shoot you.

18
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,660
Because he doesn't know that it's only gonna be one punch in the nose.

19
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,280
It's also possible that a Trump tweet could push North Korea over the edge.

20
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,080
You could imagine that in the middle of a crisis,

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,620
where there's a lot of stress and confirmation bias and pressure,

22
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,640
a poorly worded tweet might be interpreted as the start of an attack.

23
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,220
North Korea may also strike first, but that's less likely.

24
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,860
At least, that's what former missile launch officer Bruce Blair thinks.

25
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:47,680
I would be willing to imagine that he would not launch a nuclear weapon at the United States

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,120
or our allies unprovoked,

27
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,095
because he knows that would be the absolute end of his regime.

28
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,540
They are worried that the Kim family will suffer the same fate as Saddam and his family

29
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,460
or maybe Muammar Gaddafi.

30
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,300
Regardless of the trigger, Lewis says North Korea's attack would be in two phases.

31
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,000
In the first phase, North Korea would look to wipe out nearby U.S. defenses.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,840
They would launch nuclear missiles at U.S. forces based in Japan and South Korea.

33
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:22,260
When they talk about nuclear weapons, they say the mission of their nuclear weapons is to deter and repel an invasion.

34
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:29,720
The purpose of those nuclear weapons would be to try to destroy the U.S.'s ability to invade them.

35
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,760
So destroy the airfields where aircraft may operate out of.

36
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:38,620
To destroy any troops that are massed. To try to damage ports.

37
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,080
The U.S. has 30,000 troops based throughout South Korea.

38
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:43,640
In the event of an attack,

39
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,500
these troops would likely evacuate their bases and help prevent North Korean troops from crossing the border.

40
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,480
Separating North and South Korea is the DMZ or demilitarized zone.

41
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,440
This is the DMZ between North and South Korea.

42
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:07,360
You can see in the distance over there North Korea, just beyond the rock that juts out.

43
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,680
Tilman Ruff was at the DMZ with ICAN — the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.

44
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,960
They were there to send a message of peace ahead of the Winter Olympics.

45
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,040
He describes what the mood was like on the border.

46
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,740
Stuff happens quite regularly.  They're shooting across the border.

47
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,920
The week before and the week we were there, North Korean soldiers tried to defect and crossed the border.

48
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,180
One of them was successful, one of them was severely injured by being shot repeatedly

49
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,280
from the North Korean side.

50
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,040
As soon as war erupts, you know there's gonna be millions if not tens of millions of dead in South Korea.

51
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,140
Seoul would be ablaze.

52
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,960
Over 25 million people live in the Seoul metro area.

53
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,980
The city itself is just 35 miles from the DMZ,

54
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,600
and there are over 3,200 bomb shelters that can supposedly withstand an artillery attack...

55
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,080
but not necessarily a nuclear or chemical attack.

56
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:08,680
A single 250 kt nuclear bomb over Seoul would cause an estimated 783K deaths,

57
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,960
and one over Tokyo would cause about 697K, according to a study by a group called 38 North.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,040
The people of Seoul, however, seem unfazed by the constant threat.

59
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,500
58 percent of South Koreans don't think North Korea would actually start a war,

60
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,220
according to a 2017 survey by Gallup Korea.

61
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:35,340
"Ironically, living here makes me feel less threatened against [threats].”

62
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:43,800
“[Nuclear weapons] may be used as a means of threat, but I don't think they would actually use it to start a war."

63
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Other potential targets in South Korea could include the port of Busan,

64
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,560
the South Korean president's home, the military base Yongsan Garrison, and Camp Humphreys.

65
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:00,660
Once the nearby US defense is taken out, phase two would be to aim the nukes directly at the United States.

66
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,900
This propaganda photo from 2013 shows a map of potential targets.

67
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,540
These include Pacific Command in Hawaii; PACOM's naval ports in San Diego;

68
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,880
Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, which is home to the US Air Force's Global Strike Command;

69
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,040
and Washington, D.C.

70
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:24,940
It would take about 30 minutes for a missile to reach the US, and 10-15 to hit Japan or South Korea.

71
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,380
We wouldn't know until it actually exploded whether it was a conventional warhead,

72
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,295
a nuclear, or chemical, or biological warhead.

73
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,080
So, how would the U.S. respond?

74
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,040
Blair was a missile launch control officer with the U.S. Air Force.

75
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,760
If Kim Jong Un launched a ballistic missile or more at the United States,

76
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:53,540
we would detect the launch within a minute from satellites in space that have heat sensors.

77
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:59,760
Early warning teams in Colorado and Omaha, Nebraska would receive this information as well as reports

78
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,700
from ground radar in Alaska which could identify the path of a missile within 2 minutes of launch.

79
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,740
And those crews in the United States would have about 3 minutes from the time they got the first sensor

80
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,980
information until they are supposed to assess whether we are under attack.

81
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,940
They alert the Pentagon of the threat, as well as Strategic Command,

82
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,360
who would initiate an emergency teleconference with the president and his advisors,

83
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,120
including the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and the National Security Advisor.

84
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,245
A 4-star general at Strategic Command would brief the president on the threat and his options.

85
00:06:35,245 --> 00:06:41,520
He has probably on average about 6 minutes to deliberate and decide what to do.

86
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,740
The War Room and the Pentagon would then challenge the president

87
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:50,100
to authenticate using a special code known as the "biscuit."

88
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:57,740
A launch order would be sent to underground and submarine crews that includes the war plan and special authentication codes.

89
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:03,820
I was one of them. It would have taken me 1 minute to carry out that launch order. It's the length of a tweet.

90
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,600
All in all, it could be 20 minutes before missiles are launched at North Korea.

91
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,720
If North Korea launches their missile from a submarine - then the entire process needs to be twice as fast.

92
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:23,000
The US has 44 missile interceptors stationed in California and Alaska, but it's not a guaranteed defense.

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,640
The odds are very low that a single missile could destroy a warhead.

94
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,040
So we would have to launch a salvo of our missile interceptors

95
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:39,820
to have any chance of destroying an incoming North Korean nuclear warhead.

96
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:45,040
F-35 fighter jets could also be used to respond to and "kill" missiles early in the launch,

97
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,900
but we don't yet have this capability in the United States.

98
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,940
North Korea may also fire off decoys to confuse our defenses, while the real nukes hit their targets.

99
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,760
Millions of people could die if just one of these nukes hits a major city.

100
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,460
While we have an alert system in place, and disaster relief with FEMA,

101
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,260
there's very little someone can do to protect themselves in this situation.

102
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:13,620
All of the bomb shelters and other protection that we had during the Cold War have all atrophied

103
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,400
and basically been shut down. So we're starting all over again almost.

104
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,860
North Korea has no missile defense, so the U.S. could very easily wipe out most of the country with its own nukes.

105
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,460
But we are more likely to use non-nuclear options to stop them.

106
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,900
We'd win a conventional war. We don't need nuclear weapons.

107
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,580
The US would target its nuclear reactors, missile-production facilities, and launching pads

108
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,659
for intercontinental ballistic missiles with stealth aircraft, submarines, and ships.

109
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,679
There are estimates of about 200 launchers spread around North Korea.

110
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,800
The U.S. would also try to take out Kim Jong Un, who would likely be moved to a bunker

111
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,660
soon after a U.S airstrike.

112
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,520
With or without nuclear weapons, I don't think Kim gets out of this alive.

113
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,260
How would other countries respond?

114
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,740
Japan and South Korea both have ground-based missile defense systems

115
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:09,420
But those defenses, you know they don't really have a great operational record.

116
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,400
China's involvement would likely depend on who strikes first.

117
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:21,840
China would almost certainly come to the defense of North Korea if the United States attacks first.

118
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:28,980
It's also indicated to North Korea, that if North Korea attacks first, it's on its own.

119
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,080
In the case of Russia, I think it would more or less stand pat.

120
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,660
While a nuclear war would be devastating, it's a real possibility.

121
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:44,800
I think that the odds are very significant that in the next 25 years, nuclear weapons will be used.

122
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,080
The Nobel Peace prize winning group ICAN is working on a treaty to end nuclear proliferation.

123
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,000
I think the more promising approach is really a global one.

124
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,800
That doesn't say nuclear weapons are okay for me but not for you.

125
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,480
You better get rid of yours. But that says nuclear weapons are not okay for everybody.

126
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,340
Blair's group, Global Zero, is working towards the same goal.

127
00:10:08,340 --> 00:00:00,000
We have to get rid of nuclear weapons. It's the only solution.
