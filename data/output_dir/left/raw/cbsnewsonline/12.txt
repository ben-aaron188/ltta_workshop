AND, OUR ELECTIONS ARE AT RISK. 

20
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:37,170

DEPORT THEM ALL IT SAID.

44
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:21,748

THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. 

61
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:50,777
SO, HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THIS? 

62
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,911
CAN YOU BREAK DOWN EXACTLY WHAT 

63
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:56,082
IT WAS THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO 

64
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:56,482
DO? 

65
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:56,749
>> YEAH. 

66
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:57,917
THIS IS VERY SIGNIFICANT. 

67
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:00,954
AND, IT IS -- SHE IS CHARGED IN 

68
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,422
A CONSPIRACY THAT IS SELF-

69
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:12,565
DESCRIBED AS AN INFORMATION WAR 

70
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:13,466
AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. 

71
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,801
IT IS A REAL THREAT TO OUR 

72
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,802
DEMOCRACY, AND WHAT IS NEW 

73
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,203
ABOUT THIS AS MENTIONED IN THE 

74
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:18,338
OPENING, IT IS AN ATTEMPT TO 

75
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:19,139
INTERFERE WITH OUR UPCOMING 

76
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:19,839
MIDTERM ELECTIONS, WHICH IS 

77
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:23,776
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAVE 

78
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:24,176
SEEN PREVIOUSLY. 

79
00:02:24,176 --> 00:02:25,278
>> HOW SIGNIFICANT IS IT THAT 

80
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,246
ONE INDIVIDUAL IS BEING CHARGED 

81
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,146
RATHER THAN A WHOLE TROLL 

82
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:27,547
FACTORY? 

83
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:28,581
>> RIGHT, SO -- THE PROCEDURE 

84
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,184
THAT WE SEE HERE LOOKS VERY 

85
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:32,751
MUCH LIKE THIS WAS A SPECIFIC 

86
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:36,522
EXPERT TO TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY, 

87
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:37,957
TO ARREST THIS PARTICULAR 

88
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:38,257
INDIVIDUAL. 

89
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:41,160
SO -- THE CHARGES THEMSELVES 

90
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,996
AND THE PRIOR INTERNET RESEARCH 

91
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,063
AGENCY INDICTMENT SUGGESTS A 

92
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:50,803
MUCH BROADER GROUP OF PEOPLE 

93
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:51,370
THAN THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL. 

94
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,338
BUT, THIS PARTICULAR PROCEDURE 

95
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,807
THAT WE SEE HERE LOOKS VERY 

96
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,009
MUCH LIKE IT WAS DESIGNED TO 

97
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,777
TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ARREST 

98
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,245
THIS ONE PERSON WHILE SHE WAS 

99
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,913
IN A PLACE WHERE SHE COULD BE 

100
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:05,251
ARRESTED. 

101
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,419
>> AND PRESUMABLY SHE HAD SOME 

102
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:07,186
SORT OF LEADERSHIP ROLE? 

103
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,888
>> SHE IS NAMED AS THE CHIEF 

104
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:10,256
ACCOUNTANT OF THIS GROUP, OF 

105
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:12,659
THIS CONSPIRACY, WITH 

106
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,227
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL ASPECTS 

107
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:16,396
OF THE FINANCING. 

108
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,031
SO, THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO IS 

109
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,266
GOING TO HAVE VERY DETAILED 

110
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,401
KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THIS 

111
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,670
CONSPIRACY WORK AND INFORMATION 

112
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:32,245
ABOUT ITS METHODS AND WHAT IT 

113
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:32,745
ACTUALLY DID. 

114
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,047
>> HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT SHE 

115
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:34,981
WILL BE ARRESTED AND STAND 

116
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:35,415
TRIAL? 

117
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,616
>> SO, THAT IS A GREAT 

118
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:36,883
QUESTION. 

119
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,784
AND, ORDINARILY INDICTMENTS 

120
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,152
LIKE THIS -- OR, CHARGES LIKE 

121
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,486
THISÃSOMETIMES THEY ARE 

122
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,622
CRITICIZED FOR BEING KIND OF 

123
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:43,489
PAPER EXERCISES. 

124
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,493
YOU KNOW, THE CRITICISM IS THAT 

125
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,795
THE DEFENDANTS WILL NEVER SEE A 

126
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:49,095
COURTROOM. 

127
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,763
THIS PROCEDURE LOOKS DIFFERENT. 

128
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:51,698
THIS WAS A COMPLAINT. 

129
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,733
IT WAS FILED AT THE END OF 

130
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:59,972
SEPTEMBER AND IT WAS UNSEALED 

131
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:01,541
JUST NOW, VERY CLOSE TO OUR 

132
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,876
MIDTERM ELECTION.  MY EDUCATED 

133
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,279
GUESS IS THAT BECAUSE SHE WAS 

134
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,247
IN A POSITION WHERE SHE COULD 

135
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:13,286
BE ARRESTED.  

136
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,187
NOW, DOES THIS INDICTMENT MEAN 

137
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,421
ANYTHING FOR THE ROBERT MUELLER 

138
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,022
INVESTIGATION? 

139
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:20,192
>> WELL, INDIRECTLY. 

140
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:21,127
ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR HERE 

141
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:21,928
IS THAT THESE CHARGES WERE 

142
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,429
BROUGHT BY THE NATIONAL 

143
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,764
SECURITY DIVISION OF THE 

144
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,398
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, NOT BY 

145
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,066
THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE. 

146
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:34,107
BUT, THEY DOVETAIL VERY CLOSELY 

147
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:34,941
WITH THE INTERNET RESEARCH 

148
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,842
AGENCY INDICTMENT, WHICH THE 

149
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:36,943
SPECIAL COUNSEL RETURNED AT THE 

150
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,777
BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. 

151
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:38,678
IN FACT, THEY OVERLAP VERY 

152
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:39,545
CLOSELY. 

153
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,347
SO, WHAT THIS CHARGE INDICATES 

154
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:48,321
IS THAT IS FURTHER EVIDENCE OF 

155
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:49,555
THE CONSENSUS VIEW OF THE 

156
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,155
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY THAT 

157
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:52,692
RUSSIANS WERE INTERFERING WITH 

158
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,428
OUR ELECTION IN THE PAST AND 

159
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,096
NOW THIS NEW SET OF CHARGES 

160
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,132
SHOWS IT IS CONTINUING UP UNTIL 

161
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:03,303
NOW WITH AN EFFORT TO INTERFERE 

162
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,203
WITH THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. 

163
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,605
>> THAT IS WHAT SO MANY PEOPLE 

164
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:06,672
ARE WORRIED ABOUT. 

165
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:09,842
NOW, HAS THERE BEEN ANY RESPONSE

166
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:13,913
FROM HER OR HER ATTORNEYS OR 

167
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:14,947
ANYONE RELATED TO HER? 

168
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,616
>> WE DO NOT KNOW THAT YET. 

169
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:17,984
BUT, I HAVE NOT READ COVERAGE 

170
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,418
OF THAT. 

171
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:27,727
IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE IT WAS 

172
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:28,628
SEALED IN SUPPORT OF AN 

173
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,829
EXTRADITION PROCEEDING THAT MAY 

174
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,462
BE OCCURRING IN A FOREIGN 

175
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:31,030
COUNTRY. 

176
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,298
SO, FRANKLY, GIVEN THE 

177
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,765
ALLEGATIONS AND THE INTERNET 

178
00:05:33,765 --> 00:05:38,704
RESEARCH INDICTMENT IN 

179
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:39,539
FEBRUARY, YOU WOULD THINK THAT 

180
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,240
TH CO-CONSPIRATORS HERE WOULD 

181
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,408
BE PERHAPS MORE CAREFUL ABOUT 

182
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:46,012
TRAVELING TO AN ALLIED COUNTRY 

183
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,046
THAT WOULD SUPPORT US IN 

184
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,047
EXTRADITING SOMEBODY THAT WAS 

185
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,482
SUBJECT TO CHARGES HERE. 

186
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,317
MY EDUCATED GUESS ABOUT THIS IS 

187
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:55,988

00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:11,923
IT IS A TAX. 

555
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:12,724
IT IS AN INCOME TAX. 

556
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:16,595
IT IS 40+ PERCENT. 

557
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:17,696
THE NEW CODE, A LITTLE BIT 

558
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:17,929
LESS. 

559
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,064
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE. 

560
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,665
SO, YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE IT ALL 

561
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:21,099
UP FRONT. 

562
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,167
IF YOU ARE YOUNGER, YOU MAY 

563
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:22,901
WANT IT OVERTIME. 

564
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,135
I QUITE FRANKLY PREFER IT ALL 

565
00:23:24,135 --> 00:23:24,402
UP FRONT. 

566
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,303
IF I WIN THIS ONE. 

567
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,338
JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN THEN 

568
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,106
CONTROL THE MONEY AND IT IS 

569
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,208
LESS, BUT IT IS NOT -- 

570
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,043
>> YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO FEELS 

571
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:33,345
COMFORTABLE CONTROLLING YOUR 

572
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:33,845
FINANCIAL SITUATION. 

573
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,614
IF IT IS SOMEBODY THAT IS A 

574
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,282
LITTLE WORRIED, WHETHER THEY 

575
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:38,383
ARE GOING TO USE THE MONEY 

576
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:39,150
WISELY, WOULD YOU RECOMMEND 

577
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:40,418
THAN THE YEARLY PAYOUT? 

578
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:46,658
>> WHEN YOU'RE TALKING THESE 

579
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:47,659
KIND OF NUMBERS, THEN YES, 

580
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:48,493
YEARLY PAYOUT IS FINE.  

581
00:23:48,493 --> 00:23:49,928
NORMALLY THERE IN THE TENS OF 

582
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,162
MILLIONS, WHICH IS TAXED AT 5 

583
00:23:51,162 --> 00:23:51,429
MILLION. 

584
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,363
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT $1 BILLION. 

585
00:23:52,363 --> 00:23:53,398
THE NUMBER IS STAGGERING. 

586
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:54,666
I'M THINKING -- DR. EVIL. 

587
00:23:54,666 --> 00:24:00,672
BUT, $1 BILLION -- WHATEVER THE 

588
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:01,873
PAYOUT WOULD BE ANNUALLY IS 

589
00:24:01,873 --> 00:24:03,108
STILL GOING TO BE IN THE TENS 

590
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,476
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. 

591
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:05,410
SO, YEAH. 

592
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,378
AN ANNUAL PAYOUT IS NOT BAD 

593
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:07,379
$.10 MILLION EVERY YEAR. 

594
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:08,380
>> IT IS ALL GOOD. 

595
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,050
IT IS ALL GOOD. 

596
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,351
WHAT ARE WE ARGUING OVER? 

597
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,385
NOW, WHAT ABOUT THESE CASES 

598
00:24:14,385 --> 00:24:15,554
WHERE PEOPLE GO IN AS AN OFFICE 

599
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:15,754
POOL. 

600
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,923
ARE THERE EXTRA LEGAL 

601
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:18,523
DIFFICULTIES TO THAT? 

602
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:19,658
AND HAVE YOU SEEN FIGHTS ERUPT 

603
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:19,958
OVER THAT? 

604
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,826
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF LEGAL 

605
00:24:21,826 --> 00:24:26,131
CONSIDERATIONS SO, WHAT YOU 

606
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:26,898
HAVE TO DO IS ESSENTIALY PUT 

607
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:27,632
IT IN WRITING. 

608
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,100
YOU KNOW, HAVE A FORMAL 

609
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,368
AGREEMENT BEFORE.  

610
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,570
YOU SAY -- LET'S HAVE THE 

611
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:36,207
FOLLOWING FIVE PEOPLE GO IN, 

612
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:37,876
PUT IN FIVE DOLLARS EACH. 

613
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:44,749
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING IN 

614
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,051
WRITING BECAUSE AT THE END OF 

615
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,385
THE DAY IT IS A CONTRACT AND 

616
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:48,820
THE QUESTIO IS WHAT IS THE 

617
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,621
INTENT OF THE PARTIES? 

618
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:50,822
IF YOU ARE FIGHTING OVER TO THE 

619
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,123
SIXTH PERSON SAYS YOU ARE IN 

620
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,291
AND YOU HAVE AN EMAIL SAYING 

621
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:54,292
YOU REALLY WERE NOT. 

622
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:56,027
WE ALL PAID, SO WE ARE IN THIS 

623
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:56,828
GROUP, IT IS BETTER. 

624
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:57,962
AND, HE ALSO HAVE FAMILY FIGHTS 

625
00:24:57,962 --> 00:24:58,897
PRETTY WILL HAVE FAMILY FIGHTS. 

626
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,231
THE COUSIN SAYS I WAS PART OF 

627
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:03,768
THAT IF YOU WILL TEAM OF 

628
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:04,034
WINNERS. 

629
00:25:04,034 --> 00:25:05,570
SO, EVERYTHING HAS TO BE DONE 

630
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,571
IN WRITING AND THERE IS A LOT 

631
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:08,106
OF LITIGATION BECAUSE $1 

632
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,307
BILLION IS OUTRAGEOUS BUT EVEN 

633
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:10,575
$100 MILLION, PEOPLE TALK ABOUT 

634
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:15,514
IT.  

635
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,648
HE WILL FIGHT OVER THAT, 

636
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:17,649
BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE FIGURE THEY 

637
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:18,683
GET THEIR SHOT, THEY GET THEIR 

638
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,884
LAWYER ON A CONTINGENCY AND 

639
00:25:19,884 --> 00:25:20,918
THEY WILL FIGHT IT. 

640
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:27,592
>> MOST OF THE TIME THEY LOSE. 

641
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,027
>> WITHOUT ANY -- WITHOUT A 

642
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:29,627
CONCRETE PIECE OF PAPER. 

643
00:25:29,627 --> 00:25:30,228
>> SOMETHING. 

644
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:31,496
BECAUSE, AT THE END OF THE DAY, 

645
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:32,731
WHAT DID YOU INTEND WHEN THAT 

646
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:33,999
PERSON WALKED UP AND PAID FOR 

647
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:34,633
THE LOTTERY TICKET? 

648
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:35,567
THAT IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT IS 

649
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:36,568
GOING TO RULE OUT. 

650
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,003
>> SINCE YOU PRESENTED A LOT OF 

651
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,704
PAST WINNERS, ARE THEY ALL 

652
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,072
HAPPY, DOES IT BUY HAPPINESS? 

653
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:42,440
>> IT IS FUNNY, THEY ARE HAPPY, 

654
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,142
BUT I SAW A STUDY NOT LONG AGO 

655
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,377
THAT SAID SEVERAL OF THEM ARE 

656
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,277
BACK WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE 

657
00:25:46,277 --> 00:25:46,678
úTH 

658
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,113
SO, EITHER SPENT THE MONEY 

659
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,681
UNWISELY, OR INVOLVED WITH 

660
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:52,784
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AS REPUTABLE 

661
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:53,218
AS OTHERS. 

662
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:58,056
SO, I DID SEE -- 

663
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,591

664
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:00,525

00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,352
ARIZONA IS UNDERWAY RIGHT NOW. 

691
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:37,388
IF ANYBODY WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE 

692
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:39,023
AND GO OUT AND VOTE, I DON'T 

693
00:27:39,023 --> 00:27:39,624
MIND AT ALL. 

694
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:40,759
I SEE ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL RED 

695
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,729
HATS AND SOME WHITE ONES, RIGHT?

696
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:45,664
AND, SOME WHITE ONES. 

697
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,965
THE WHITE ONES ARE VERY NICE, 

698
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:50,835
THEY ARE GETTING SWAMPED BY THE 

699
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:51,035
RED. 

700
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:51,635
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 

701
00:27:51,635 --> 00:27:52,237
YOU KNOW THAT. 

702
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,905
BUT, WHAT IS THE NEW NAME? 

703
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:54,305

00:27:54,305 --> 00:28:00,345
GO AHEAD -- IN ABOUT -- WHAT 

705
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,579
YOU THINK, ANOTHER 12 MONTHS,

00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:02,947
WE CAN ALMOST DO IT SOONER, 

707
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:03,180
RIGHT? 

708
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,449
WHAT DOES IT SAY? 

709
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:07,051
KEEP AMERICA GREAT. 

710
00:28:07,051 --> 00:28:10,054
KEEP AMERICA GREAT. 

711
00:28:10,054 --> 00:28:17,095
RIGHT? 

712
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,529
WE HAVE GOT TO GET USED TO 

713
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:19,097
THAT, BECAUSE THERE IS 

714
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:20,098
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT MAKE 

715
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:20,698
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 

716
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:21,499
IT JUST WORK. 

717

BUT, THAT IS TRUE. 

718
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:23,334
BECAUSE, EVERYTHING THAT WE DO, 

719
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,169
THEY CAN DESTROY VERY QUICKLY 

720
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:26,804
IF THE WRONG PEOPLE GET INTO 

721
00:28:26,804 --> 00:28:29,207
OFFICE. 

722
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,208
AND THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE TIME 

723
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:34,479
FOR OUR NATION. THE 

724
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:35,513
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE JUST FELL TO 

725
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:36,714
THE LOWEST LEVEL IN OVER 50 

726
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:37,148
YEARS. 

727
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:37,949
[ CHEERING ] 

728
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,421
MORE AMERICANS ARE WORKING TODAY

729
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:46,991
THAN AT ANY POINT IN THE 

730
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:47,524
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 

731
00:28:47,524 --> 00:28:48,293
THINK OF IT. 

732
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,261
THAT IS A BIG NUMBER. 

733
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,564
THAT IS A BIG STATISTIC. 

734
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,497
THINK OF THAT. 

735
00:28:53,497 --> 00:29:00,371
TODAY, OR AMERICANSÃTHINK OF 

736
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:01,206
THAT, MORE AMERICANS ARE

1530
00:59:15,584 --> 00:59:16,519
THIS IS THE CRAZIEST THING. 

1531
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:24,027
LET'S GET THESE PEOPLE OUT OF 

1532
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:24,327

THEY ARE CUCKOO. 

1535
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:28,197

1541

NOT REPUBLICAN. 

1545
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:50,219
SO NOBODY SAID THEY ARE STUPID 

1546
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:51,654
BUT IT'S BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY. 

1547

THEY UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:59:54,357 --> 00:59:58,361
THAT IS WHY DEMOCRATS SUPPORT

1552
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:03,866
