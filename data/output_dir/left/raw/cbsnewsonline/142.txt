1
00:00:00,733 --> 00:00:02,635
FIRST REPORTS OF A POSSIBLE 

2
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:03,770
ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION. 

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,171
BUT AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A 

4
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,507
IDENTIFY FEW MINUTES AGO, THERE 

5
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,975
IS A HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE 

6
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:09,442
THERE. 

7
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:10,509
THAT HAS BACKED UP TRAFFIC. 

8
00:00:10,509 --> 00:00:11,277
GIVE ME ONE SECOND. 

9
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:14,079
I'M GOING TO PULL UP 

10
00:00:14,079 --> 00:00:15,648
INFORMATION THAT I -- ABOUT 

11
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:16,081
ROAD CLOSURES. 

12
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:16,950
BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT THAT TIME 

13
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,785
WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE 

14
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:24,124
GETTING OFF WORK AND SOMETHING 

15
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:24,391
TO KNOW. 

16
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,093
POLICE ACTIVITY CLOSING DOWN 

17
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:27,860
THE HIGHWAY AND 178. 

18
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,966
THAT IS BECAUSE THIS IS AN 

19
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:33,466
ONGOING INVESTIGATION. 

20
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,501
POLICE ARE ON SCENE AFTER 

21
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,302
REPORTS OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER IN 

22
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:37,036
THE GAZETTE BUILDING. 

23
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:38,538
WE ARE WORKING TO CONFIRM A LOT 

24
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,472
OF DETAILS AT THIS POINT. 

25
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:41,908
THE INITIAL REPORTS THAT I HAVE 

26
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,476
HEARD FROM SOURCES AND AGAIN 

27
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,211
ARE STILL WORKING TO CONFIRM, 

28
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,779
THIS IS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 

29
00:00:46,779 --> 00:00:47,147
SITUATION. 

30
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,014
ONE PERSON INSIDE WITH A 

31
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,816
SHOTGUN AND AS MANY AS FOUR 

32
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:50,083
VICTIMS. 

33
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,252
SO WE ARE STILL ON OUR WAY DOWN 

34
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:52,552
THERE. 

35
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,353
THERE'S A LOT OF UNANSWERED 

36
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:54,787
QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT THAT WE 

37
00:00:54,787 --> 00:00:57,557
HOPE TO LEARN MORE FROM POLICE 

38
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,157
AS THEY'RE INVESTIGATION 

39
00:00:58,157 --> 00:00:58,457
CONTINUES. 

40
00:00:58,457 --> 00:01:00,093

EVERYBODY IS IN THE NEWS

GATHERING PHASE AT THIS POINT. 

53
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,116
WE DON'T WANT TO REPORT 

54
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:26,953
ANYTHING INCORRECTLY BUT WE CAN 

55
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,755
VERIFY THERE WAS AN ACTIVE 

56
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,555
SHOOTER, FOUR VICTIMS. 

57
00:01:29,555 --> 00:01:32,058
>> WHAT WE CAN VERIFY IS WHAT 

58
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:32,825
POLICE HAVE TOLD US. 

59
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:33,792
INDEED AN ACTIVE SHOOTER. 

60
00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:35,562
AS FAR AS WE KNOW, THE 

61
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:36,863
SITUATION HAS NOT BEEN 

62
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:37,163
CONTAINED. 

63
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:38,198
AS JESSICA MENTIONED WE GET A 

64
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,166
LOT OF OUR INFORMATION WHEN IT 

65
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,868
IS BREAKING THIS QUICKLY FROM 

66
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:42,135

THE POLICE THEMSELVES -- HERE 

70
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,741
ARE SOME OF THEM. 

71
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,243
WE HAVE ANTHONY MESSENGER. 

72
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,911
HE IS AGAIN CONFIRMING ACTIVE 

73
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,746
SHOOTER AT BEST GATE BOULEVARD 

74
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,748
WHICH IS THE BUILDING THAT 

75
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:56,749
HOUSES THE CAPITAL GAZETTE. 

76
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,351
>> AND HE REPORTEDLY WAS AN 

77
00:01:58,351 --> 00:01:59,986
INTERN INSIDE OF THE BUILDING. 

78
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:00,453
>> UH-HUH. 

79
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,322
>> SO HERE WE HAVE JUSTIN WHO 

80
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,957
SAYS THE BALTIMORE POLICE 

81
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,692
DEPARTMENT AT BALTIMORE SUN FOR 

82
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,595
PRECAUTIONARY SWEEP BECAUSE THE 

83
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:09,628
SUN OPENS THE CAPITAL GAZETTE 

84
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:11,531
YOU FORM A CONCLUSION THIS 

85
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,701
COULD HAVE TO DO WITH 

86
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,001
NEWSPAPERS. 

87
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,237
CODY, THE BALTIMORE SUN 

88
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,505
BUILDING IS ON LOCKDOWN. 

89
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,739
THERE IS NO ACTIVE THREAT IN 

90
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,207
BALTIMORE AS FAR AS I KNOW. 

91
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,109
POLICE ARE DOING THE RIGHT 

92
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,444
THING, BEING EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS 

93
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,679
BECAUSE THERE IS INDEED AN 

94
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,481
ACTIVE SHOOTER AT THE CAPITAL 

95
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,382
GAZETTE BUILDING AND IT HOUSES 

96
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,316
A NEWSPAPER, IT ONLY MAKES 

97
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,518
SENSE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 

98
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:33,319
BALTIMORE SUN IS CONTAINED. 

99
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,754
THE SUN SAYS INVESTIGATING 

100
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:39,893
REPORTS OF AN INCIDENT AT THE 

101
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:40,927
CAPITAL GAZETTE BUILDING AND 

102
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:44,497
THEY TOO WILL SHARE DETAILS 

103
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,699
WHEN THEY ARE CONFIRMED. 

104
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:50,970
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN CONFIRM 

105
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,272
INFORMATION IS THROUGH THE 

106
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,040
POLICE AND THE OFFICIALS WHO 

107
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,343
ARE IN CHARGE OF THE 

108
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:57,710
INVESTIGATION. 

109
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,579
BUT SADLY WE DO KNOW THERE HAVE 

110
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,581
BEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 

111
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:01,848
INJURED. 

112
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:02,114
>> RIGHT. 

113
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:03,816
>> THE CONDITIONS OF THOSE 

114
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,919
PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW. 

115
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:06,986
>> RIGHT. 

116
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,554
WE SAW THE MEDEVAC HELICOPTERS. 

117
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:11,858
WE WILL TRY TO GET THE VIDEO OF 

118
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,926
PEOPLE WALKING OUT OF THE 

119
00:03:13,926 --> 00:03:14,994
CAPITAL GAZETTE BUILDING IN 

120
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,496
ANNAPOLIS ARE THEIR HANDS UP. 

121
00:03:17,496 --> 00:03:18,264
THEY ARE BEING EVACUATED. 

122
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:18,864
ALSO REPORTS THAT S.W.A.T. 

123
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:21,100
WAS TRYING TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF 

124
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,235
THE BUILDING AS QUICKLY AS 

125
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:22,502
POSSIBLE. 

126
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,936
WE HAD PRELIMINARY REPORTS 

127
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:26,773
SAYING THAT THERE MAY BE ONE 

128
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:27,540
GUNMAN. 

129
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,775
AT THIS POINT, AGAIN, NOT 

130
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:29,075
CONFIRMED. 

131
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,376
WE'RE WAITING FOR THAT 

132
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:30,843
INFORMATION AS WELL. 

133
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,980
>> I'M SURE IN A BUILDING OF 

134
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,982
THAT SIZE, UNTIL THE POLICE 

135
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:36,883
HAVE ABSOLUTELY CONTAINED THE 

136
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,518
SITUATION, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO 

137
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,019
JUMP TO ANY CONCLUSIONS ABOUT 

138
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,387
HOW MANY SHOOTERS, ET CETERA. 

139
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,689
THEY'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING, 

140
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,290
EMPTYING THE BUILDING OF 

141
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,626
EVERYTHING THAT THEY CAN EMPTY 

142
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:46,993
IT OF. 

143
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,294
MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS 

144
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,696
OKAY AND ARE OUT AND REMAIN 

145
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:52,965
OKAY AND SWEEPING THE BUILDING. 

146
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:53,299
>> RIGHT. 

147
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,902
>> ONCE AGAIN THE TWITTER FEEDS 

148
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,072
THAT WE JUST SAW SHOW THAT 

149
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,040
POLICE ARE RESPONDING JUST TO 

150
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,076
MAKE SURE THAT THIS ISN'T TO DO 

151
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,178
WITH THE NEWSPAPER OR A 

152
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:05,945
REACTION TO THE PRINT MEDIA. 

153
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:09,082
>> TODAY HAS BEEN A VERY, VERY 

154
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,116
BUSY DAY WITH BALTIMORE NEWS. 

155
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,185
THIS IS A SHOT FROM EARLIER 

156
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,854
FROM THE CHOPPER SHOWING THE 

157
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:15,287
EMERGENCY VEHICLES. 

158
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:17,957
AGAIN, WE DO HAVE REPORT THAT'S 

159
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:21,861
THERE MAY BE STILL QUITE A FEW 

160
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:22,128
VICTIMS. 

161
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,530
WE SAW THE MEDEVAC HELICOPTERS 

162
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,367
AND IT WAS UNCLEAR WHERE THEY 

163
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:27,800
WERE HEADED. 

164
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,603
OFTEN THEY ARE BROUGHT HERE TO 

165
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,303
SHOCK TRAUMA BECAUSE THEY'RE 

166
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:33,940
EQUIP TODAY HANDLE EMERGENCIES 

167
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,874
SUCH AS THIS. 

168
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,042
WE HAVE ALSO COVERED 

169
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,845
EXTENSIVELY HOW SO MANY 

170
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,980
HOSPITALS IN MARYLAND HAVE GONE 

171
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,350
TO EXTRA TRAINING TO LEARN HOW 

172
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,851
TO HANDLE A MASS CASUALTY 

173
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:46,152
SITUATION. 

174
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,420
FORTUNATELY AT THIS POINT IT IS 

175
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:47,987
NOT THERE. 

176
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:50,690
BUT THEY ARE PREPARED TO HANDLE 

177
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,924
A SHOOTING OR MULTIPLE 

178
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:52,224
SHOOTINGS. 

179
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:52,524
>> INDEED. 

180
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:54,293
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MEDICAL 

181
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:55,495
INSTITUTIONS IN THE AREA THAT 

182
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,731
CAN HANDLE AN EMERGENCY LIKE 

183
00:04:58,731 --> 00:04:58,931
THIS. 

184
00:04:58,931 --> 00:04:59,832
AS YOU SAID SHOCK TRAUMA WOULD 

185
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:04,070
BE THE NATURAL PLACE FOR THEM 

186
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,204
TO BE MEDEVACED. 

187
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:05,771
THERE ARE AMBULANCES. 

188
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:08,608

YOU SEE POLICE OBVIOUSLY 

191
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:10,309
RESPONDING. 

192
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:11,944
UNTIL THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS 

193
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:12,879
GOING ON, THEY'RE GOING TO SEND 

194
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,013
EVERY RESOURCE THAT THEY HAVE 

195
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,314

196
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:17,016
>> ALSO HEADED THAT WAY, 

197
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:17,416
KIMBERLY EATON.

00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,218
WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO YOU. 

199
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,186
YOU WERE TEN MINUTES OUT. 

200
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,487
I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE 

201
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,922
YOUR WAY TOWARDS THE STAGING 

202
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,090
AREA. 

203
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,159
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING AND

00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:26,426
HEARING? 

205
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,228
>> Reporter: WELL, WE'RE STILL

207
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:31,063
OUT. 

208
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:33,533
THINK POINT WE CAN SEE THE 

209
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,000
HELICOPTERS CIRCLING. 

210
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,601
WE HEARD REPORTS THAT THE 

211
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:36,903
POLICE HAD THEIR HELICOPTERS UP 

212
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:37,336
OVER THE SCENE. 

213
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,339
THEY ARE REALLY ON THE GROUND, 

214
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:39,706
IN THE AIR. 

215
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:42,208
THEY ARE AT THIS WITH ALL THEIR 

216
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:42,508
RESOURCES. 

217
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,110
WE HAVE SEEN A FEW POLICE CARS 

218
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,177
COME BY US. 

219
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:47,246
SO THEY ARE STILL SENDING 

220
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,049
OFFICERS LIGHTS AND SIRENS TO 

221
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,951
THIS ACTIVE AND ONGOING 

222
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:52,318
INVESTIGATION. 

223
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,355
WE ALSO ARE HEADED RIGHT NOW TO 

224
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,389
A MEDIA STAGING AREA WHERE WE 

225
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,257
ARE HOPING TO GET MORE 

226
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:58,591
INFORMATION. 

227
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,827
AT THIS POINT WE ARE SEEING A 

228
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,762
LOT OF PEOPLE TAKING PICTURES 

229
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,231
AND VIDEOS WHERE THIS HAPPENED. 

230
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,265
JUST THE MASSIVE POLICE 

231
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:06,966
RESPONSE TO THIS. 

232
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,968
AND WE HAVE HEARD THAT THERE 

233
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,571
ARE POSSIBLY SEVERAL VICTIMS 

234
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:11,938
INVOLVED HERE. 

235
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,405
I HAVE HEARD FROM A SOURCE, 

236
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:14,440
STILL UNCONFIRMED, WE ARE ON 

237
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,475
OUR WAY TO THE SCENE TO CONFIRM 

238
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:17,443
THIS, THERE WAS ONE PERSON 

239
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,579
INSIDE OF THE BUILDING WITH A 

240
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:19,846
SHOTGUN. 

241
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,047
AS MIKE HAD MENTIONED EARLIER, 

242
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,014
THERE ARE SO MANY UNANSWERED 

243
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:22,748
QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT. 

244
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,617
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MOTIVE 

245
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:25,117
IS HERE. 

246
00:06:25,117 --> 00:06:26,285
WE DON'T KNOW WHY TODAY, WHY 

247
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,087
THIS LOCATION OR REALLY A LOT 

248
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,656
OF THE DETAILS OF WHAT EXACTLY 

249
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,191
UNFOLDED IN THESE MINUTES, 

250
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,092
THESE TERRIFYING MINUTES INSIDE 

251
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:37,263
OF THIS BUILDING ABOUT AN HOUR 

252
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:38,064
AGO. 

253
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,534
BUT WE ARE HOPING TO LEARN 

254
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:41,634
MORE. 

255
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:48,441
I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE ARE LOW 

256
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,343
ON THE LIST OF PEOPLE TO GET 

257
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:51,677
INFORMATION. 

258
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,379
THE POLICE HAVE LARGER -- 

259
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,781
LARGER ISSUES TO DEAL WITH. 

260
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:57,583
>> WE HAVE LEARNED SO FAR THERE 

261
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,318
IS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION 

262
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:04,323

POLICE ARE AT THE SCENE. 

267
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,930
THEY HAVE CALLED THE SITUATION 

268
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,363
ACTIVE AND ONGOING. 

269
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:12,865
THERE ARE REPORTS THAT POLICE 

270
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,166
OFFICERS ARE CURRENTLY 

271
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:15,667
SEARCHING THE BUILDING. 

272
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:16,602
LET'S B 

273
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,936
SECURITY CORRESPONDENT JEFF WHO 

274
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:20,473

275
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:20,806
>> YEAH. 

276
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:23,009
YOU CAN SEE ADRIANA FROM THESE 

277
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,311
CHOPPER PICTURES THAT THERE IS 

278
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,078
AN ONGOING RESPONSE THERE. 

279
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,780
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH 

280
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,981
LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES WHO SAY 

281
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,216
THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO GET UP 

282
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,952
TO SPEED ON THIS SITUATION. 

283
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:37,123
WE KNOW THAT THE ATF IS 

284
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:37,490
RESPONDING. 

285
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,692
WE KNOW THAT THE FBI WON'T BE 

286
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:39,992
FAR BEHIND. 

287
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,994
I TALKED TO A LAW ENFORCEMENT 

288
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:45,998
SOURCE THERE IN AINSPECT POLICE 

289
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,233
A FEW -- IN ANNAPOLIS WHO SAY 

290
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,235
THEY ARE HEADING INTO THE 

291
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,035
EMERGENCY OPERATION CENTER. 

292
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:51,938
CLEARLY THIS IS AN ONGOING 

293
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:52,505
SITUATION. 

294
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,140
THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO ASSESS 

295
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,307
THE EXTENT OF ANY INJURIES. 

296
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:57,276
THERE ARE REPORTS RIGHT NOW 

297
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,378
THAT WE HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THAT 

298
00:07:59,378 --> 00:07:59,911
THERE ARE INJURIES. 

299
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:01,747
WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF 

300
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:02,114
THOSE INJURIES. 

301
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,183
AND MY SOURCES ARE TELLING ME 

302
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,017
THAT THEY DON'T KNOW EITHER. 

303
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,752
THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO GET A 

304
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,654
GRIP ON THE SITUATION THAT IS 

305
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,455
UNFOLDING RIGHT NOW. 

306
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,358
WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT THIS IS 

307
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:13,125
AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION 

308
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:18,531
THAT THEY ARE RESPONDING TO. 

309
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,600
RESPONDING TO THIS CAPITAL 

310
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,101
GAZETTE BUILDING IN ANNAPOLIS. 

311
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,303
THERE ARE PEOPLE EVACUATING THE 

312
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:24,570
BUILDING. 

313
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,238
THERE IS A LARGE POLICE 

314
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:26,605
PRESENCE HERE. 

315
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:28,607
SO CLEARLY THIS IS A SITUATION 

316
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:30,109
THAT IS ONGOING. 

317
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:33,679
>> JEFF, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US 

318
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,881
ABOUT POTENTIAL TARGETS FOR 

319
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,649
THIS KIND OF SHOOTING? 

320
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:40,653
AND HOW PREPARED OR UNPREPARED 

321
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,587
A NEWSPAPER MIGHT BE? 

322
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:45,925
>> IT'S TOO EARLY TO SPECULATE 

323
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:46,558
ON ANY POTENTIAL TARGETS. 

324
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:50,296
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THIS IS 

325
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:51,030
SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS 

326
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,733
BECOME ALL TOO FAMILIAR TO 

327
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,468
AMERICANS AND TO BUSINESSES 

328
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,902
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. 

329
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:58,371
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SOME 

330
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,105
BUSINESSES DRILL FOR. 

331
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,706
WE KNOW THAT SCHOOLS DRILL FOR 

332
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,040
THIS. 

333
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,341
SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE 

334
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:03,442
SITUATIONS THAT WE ARE SEEING 

335
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,710
MORE AND MORE IN THIS COUNTRY. 

336
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,413
AND YOU SEE HERE PEOPLE BEING 

337
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,014
EVACUATED FROM THE BUILDING. 

338
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:11,350
THEY HAVE THEIR ARMS STRETCHED 

339
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,683
IN THE AIR. 

340
00:09:11,683 --> 00:09:14,152
THAT IS PROTOCOL IN SWAYINGS 

341
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:14,553
LIKE THIS. 

342
00:09:14,553 --> 00:09:16,889
BECAUSE AS PEOPLE COME OUT, 

343
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,291
INVESTIGATORS DON'T KNOW WHO IS 

344
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,126
FRIEND OR WHO IS FAUX. 

345
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:22,962
SO THEY TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT 

346
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,397
THE ENVIRONMENT IS SECURE BY 

347
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,831
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE EXITING 

348
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,266
THE BUILDING HAVE THEIR HANDS 

349
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:27,533
UP. 

350
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:31,871
WE HAVE HEARD IN THE PAST OF 

351
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:32,705
ACTIVE SHOOTERS ESCAPING FROM A 

352
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:33,873
SHOOTING SITUATION BY WALKING 

353
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:36,475
OUT WITH THE PEOPLE BEING 

354
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:36,775
EVACUATED. 

355
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:40,079
IN FACT THAT HAPPENED IN 

356
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:40,579
PARKLAND, FOR EXAMPLE. 

357
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,415
AND SO THIS IS STANDARD 

358
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:42,882
OPERATING PROCEDURE. 

359
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,216
THE IMAGES THAT YOU SEE THERE 

360
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,018
ON YOUR SCREEN OF PEOPLE BEING 

361
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:46,986
EVACUATED WITH THEIR HANDS UP, 

362
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:50,256
THAT IS WHAT YOU DO IN 

363
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:50,756
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. 

364
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,391
THAT IS WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS 

365
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:52,758
TRAINED TO DO. 

366
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,894
AND SO WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE 

367
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,629
IS SORT OF A STANDARD RESPONSE 

368
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,097
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. 

369
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,497
AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE 

370
00:09:59,497 --> 00:10:00,766
NOW DRILL FOR ACROSS THE 

371
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,500
COUNTRY. 

372
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,336
>> IT IS A CHILLING SCENE TO 

373
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,203
SEE THOSE PEOPLE WALKING OUT 

374
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,604
WITH THEIR HANDS UP. 

375
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:08,007
WE HAVE SEEN THAT OVER AND OVER 

376
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,042
AGAIN AS THESE ACTIVE SHOOTERS 

377
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:13,446
HAVE UNFOLDED IN WORKPLACES AND 

378
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:13,713
SCHOOLS. 

379
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:14,280
TOO MANY OF THEM. 

380
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,315
WE JUST GOT WORD THAT THE 

381
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,150
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN BRIEFED ON 

382
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,086
THE SHOOTING AND HE SAYS OUR 

383
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,154
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH 

384
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,255
ALL THAT ARE AFFECTED. 

385
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:24,423
JEFF, TALK TO US BUT HOW 

386
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:26,058
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LAW 

387
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,226
ENFORCEMENT, ALL THE WAY UP, 

388
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:31,030
UNO OWE THE CHAIN OF GOVERNMENT 

389
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,630
ARE RESPONDING TO THIS. 

390
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,500
AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING FROM THE 

391
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,735
LOCAL LEVEL TO THE FBI TO 

392
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:36,168
PEOPLE ABOVE THAT. 

393
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,303
>> WHAT THEY KNOW IS THE BEST 

394
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,637
<u>AY TO RESPOND TO A  </u>

395
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:41,640
LIKE THIS IS TO DO IT IN A 

396
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,107
COORDINATED FASHION. 

397
00:10:42,107 --> 00:10:43,676
SURE, THEY DON'T WASTE ANY 

398
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:43,876
TIME. 

399
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,010
LOCAL POLICE GET THERE AS FAST 

400
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,779
AS THEY CAN AND MOVE IN AS FAST 

401
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:47,513
AS THEY CAN. 

402
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,214
AT LEAST THAT IS THE PRACTICE. 

403
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:51,384
BUT WHAT YOU ALSO HAVE IS THE 

404
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,651
RESPONSE FROM THE FEDERAL 

405
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:53,018
AGENCIES. 

406
00:10:53,018 --> 00:10:53,552
YOU HAVE THE ATF. 

407
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,321
THEY ARE RESPONDING TO THE 

408
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:55,721
SCENE. 

409
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:56,755
YOU HAVE THE FBI LOCALLY THERE. 

410
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:58,357
THEY ARE RESPONDING TO THE 

411
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:58,758
SCENE. 

412
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,659
BECAUSE WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT 

413
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,895
THE COORDINATED RESPONSE IS THE 

414
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:03,262
BEST RESPONSE. 

415
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:06,298
I HAVE JUST GOTTEN SOME NEW 

416
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:06,631
INFORMATION. 

417
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:09,602
CBS NEWS' TWO SOURCES REPORTING 

418
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,771
NOW THAT THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE 

419
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:11,971
DEAD. 

420
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,806
SO THAT IS NEW INFORMATION THAT 

421
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:14,173
WE HAVE. 

422
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,741
WE HAVE HEARD THAT THERE ARE 

423
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,010
INJURIES AND NOW WE'RE HEARING 

424
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,013
THAT THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE 

425
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:21,680
DEAD. 

426
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,549
AGAIN, THIS IS STILL AN EARLY 

427
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:23,982
DEVELOPING STORY. 

428
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:25,684
AND SOMETIMES IN SITUATIONS 

429
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,153
LIKE THESE YOU GET INACCURATE 

430
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:27,486
INFORMATION. 

431
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:30,790
WHICH IS WHY WE TRY TO GET TWO 

432
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,390
SOURCES ON THIS. 

433
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,225
WHICH -- AND THESE SOURCES ARE 

434
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,894
TELLING US THAT THERE ARE AT 

435
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,262
LEAST TWO PEOPLE DEAD. 

436
00:11:37,262 --> 00:11:38,664
AS I SAID EARLIER, LAW 

437
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:39,231
ENFORCEMENT THERE LOCALLY, 

438
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,467
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET A HANDLE 

439
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,101
ON THE SITUATION. 

440
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,603
THERE IS NO INFORMATION RIGHT 

441
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,372
NOW TO SUGGEST THAT ANYONE IS 

442
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:46,672
IN CUSTODY. 

443
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:49,875
SO THAT IS OBVIOUSLY A PRIORITY 

444
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,308
FOR INVESTIGATORS. 

445
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:52,411
>> JEFF WE'RE GOING TO LET YOU 

446
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,879
GET BACK TO WORKING YOUR 

447
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:54,146
SOURCES. 

448
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:54,846
THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION. 

449
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:56,816
>>> JUST TO WRAP UP WHAT WE 

450
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,350
HAVE LEARNED SO FAR, JEFF JUST 

451
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,753
TOLD US THAT HIS SOURCES TELL 

452
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,021
HIM, TWO SOURCES, THAT FOUR 

453
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,589
PEOPLE ARE DEAD AT THE SCENE. 

454
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:06,525
THIS IS AN ACTIVE SHOOTING 

455
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:10,162
INVESTIGATION AT THE CAPITAL 

456
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,597
GAZETTE BUILDING IN ANNAPOLIS, 

457
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:11,864
MARYLAND. 

458
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:12,798
WE HAVE SEEN THE PICTURES OF 

459
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:14,600
PEOPLE BEING RUSHED OUT OF THE 

460
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,735
BUILDING WITH THEIR HANDS UP. 

461
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,469
WE SEE VIDEO OF LAW ENFORCEMENT 

462
00:12:17,469 --> 00:12:18,103
AT THE SCENE. 

463
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:20,506
WE SAW PEOPLE BEING EVACUATED 

464
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:20,873
BY HELICOPTER. 

465
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:21,607
SO THAT WOULD INDICATE THERE 

466
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,043
ARE ALSO PEOPLE WHO WERE 

467
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:24,610
INJURED. 

468
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,045
NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 

469
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:26,946
-- WHO HAVE PASSED AWAY. 

470
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:32,151
LET'S TAKE YOU BACK NOW TO OUR 

471
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,552
BALTIMORE STATION WJZ. 

472
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:36,055
>> ON HIM OR HER. 

473
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,456
AND SO POLICE CONTINUE TO COMB 

474
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,592
THAT BUILDING DESPITE THE FACT 

475
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,093
THAT THE PEOPLE INSIDE HAVE 

476
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,528
BEEN EVACUATED FOR THE MOST 

477
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:42,761
PART. 

478
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,763
>> SO IT APPEARS AS THOUGH 

479
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,265
SOMEBODY WENT INTO THE CAPITAL 

480
00:12:47,265 --> 00:12:47,532
GAZETTE. 

481
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:47,799
>> RIGHT. 

482
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,068
>> IT WASN'T JUST IN THE 

483
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:49,335
BUILDING. 

484
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,504
IT APPEARS FROM THE REPORTER 

485
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,304
WHO TWEETED THAT OUT, REPORTS 

486
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,039
THERE THAT THERE WAS A SHOOTING 

487
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,674
IN THE NEWS ROOM. 

488
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,476
IT ALSO APPEARS THAT THERE WERE 

489
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:57,943
INJURIES. 

490
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,612

ABOUT THIS TERRIBLE SITUATION. 

496
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:15,094
WE MUST UNITE TO END THE 

497
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,996
VIOLENCE. 

498
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,031

THE GAZETTE. 

501
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:25,037
>> WE DO HAVE ONE SOURCE WHO IS 

502
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:27,639
A RELIABLE SOURCE WHO IS 

503
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,674

MENTIONED, ONE SUSPECT IS IN 

505
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:30,743
CUSTODY. 

506
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:31,844
NOW, OF COURSE POLICE HAVE TO 

507
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:33,479
MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO OTHER 

508
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,914
SUSPECTS AT LOOSE IN THAT 

509
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:35,181
BUILDING. 

510
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,215
SO THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE 

511
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,017
THAT HE WORKED ALONE OR SHE 

512
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,885

CONFIRM THAT MULTIPLE PEOPLE 

526
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:06,111

00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:19,792
AVOID THE AREA AROUND ANNAPOLIS 

535
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,227

00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:33,472
ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION. 

543
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:34,139

544
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:40,045

EARLY ON IN THIS INVESTIGATION. 

579
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,370
BUT THE GOOD NEWS FOR 

580
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,506
INVESTIGATORS IS THEY HAVE A 

581
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:41,172

00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,985
ONGOING FOR THE LAST SEVERAL 

590
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:53,919
MINUTES OR SO. 

591
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,487

00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,330
CHILLING IMAGES THAT WE HAVE

00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:02,707

LET'S BRING IN PAUL VIOLIS. 

696
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,576
I JUST SAW YOU WORKING THE

00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,111
PHONE TO GET INFORMATION ON 

698
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,612
THIS. 

699
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:06,879
>> RIGHT. 

700
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,678
>> WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED. 

701
00:19:07,678 --> 00:19:09,147
>> IT APPEARS THAT THE BOMB 

702
00:19:09,147 --> 00:19:10,048
SQUAD IS ALSO ATTEMPTING TO 

703
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,517
CLEAR A PACKAGE THAT WAS LEFT 

704
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,685
IN THE BUILDING BY SOMEONE THAT 

705
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:15,220
THEY HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED AS OF 

706
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:15,787
YET RIGHT NOW. 

707
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:18,090
THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS GOING 

708
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,490
ON RIGHT NOW. 

709
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,827
THE OUTER PERIMETER HAS BEEN 

710
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,060
SET. 

711
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,062
THE INNER PERIMETER HAS BEEN 

712
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:24,295
SET. 

713
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:25,964
THEY'RE TRYING TO VERIFY THEY 

714
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,633
ONLY HAVE ONE SHOOTER WHICH IS 

715
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:28,000
VERY IMPORTANT. 

716
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,035
IT APPEARS THERE WAS ONLY ONE. 

717
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:30,869
THEY'RE STILL VERIFYING THAT. 

718
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,471
WHICH MEANS FOR OUR VIEWERS 

719
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:35,774
THEY'RE LOOKING AT VIDEO TAPE 

720
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,341
AND USING ARTIFICIAL 

721
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,110
INTELLIGENCE THAT WILL ANALYZE 

722
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,845
THE ENTIRE CAMPUS TO ASCERTAIN 

723
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,713
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ONLY ONE 

724
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:41,946
PERSON. 

725
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:43,782
IF THERE IS, THEY HAVE A GUY IN 

726
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:44,215
CUSTODY RIGHT NOW. 

727
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:45,751
THE BIG THICK IS THAT THERE IS 

728
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,186
STILL A PACKAGE WHICH IS WHY 

729
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:49,988
THEY'RE CLEARING THE BUILDING. 

730
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:50,856
IN A METHODICAL WAY. 

731
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,057
THEY'RE NOT SURE IF THAT DEVICE 

732
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:55,127
RIGHT NOW IS IN FACT AN 

733
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:55,560
EXPLOSIVE DEVICE. 

734
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,229
>> AND THE ATF IS RESPONDING TO 

735
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,163
THIS, THAT THEY'RE THE ONE 

736
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:59,865
THAT'S WILL BE WORKING ON 

737
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:00,832
CLEARING THAT PACKAGE. 

738
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,202
WHEN YOU SAY THEY'RE USING 

739
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:03,769
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO 

740
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,137
ANALYZE VIDEO, WHAT DO YOU MEAN 

741
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:05,404
BY THAT. 

742
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,738
>> THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION. 

743
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,607
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THERE IS 

744
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:11,209
SOFTWARE THAT IS BUILT INTO THE 

745
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,010
CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION 

746
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,447
CAMERAS THAT YOU SEE AROUND THE 

747
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:15,680
CAMPUS. 

748
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,815
WHAT THAT ALLOWS -- WHAT THAT 

749
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:17,282
ALLOWS POLICE AND LAW 

750
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,117
úENFORCEM 

751
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:21,053
IS FOR CAMERAS TO THINK AND TO 

752
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:21,887
LEARN AND TO REMEMBER. 

753
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,989
SO THEY CAN FEED AT THAT CAMERA 

754
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,290
INFORMATION OR THE SERVER 

755
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,158
ATTACHED TO THE CAMERA 

756
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,360
INFORMATION TO SAY HAVE YOU 

757
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,428
SEEN THIS PERSON? 

758
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:30,595
AND THAT WILL RELATE TO ANY 

759
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:32,097
TIME THAT THAT PERSON HAS BEEN 

760
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,533
EVEN CLOSE OR IN VIEW OF ANY OF 

761
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,702
THOSE CAMERAS OR ANYBODY RELATE 

762
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:37,002
TODAY THAT. 

763
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,102
DID HE DRIVE ON CAMPUS? 

764
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:39,805
WAS THERE ANOTHER PERSON WITH 

765
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:40,305
THAT PERSON. 

766
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,306
HOW MANY VEHICLES WERE 

767
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:41,673
INVOLVED. 

768
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:42,607
WHERE DID THEY COME FROM, ET 

769
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:42,840
CETERA. 

770
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,209
THAT HELPS US IN THE 

771
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:44,709
INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS. 

772
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,178
>> IT IS A WAY TO SCAN SECURITY 

773
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,547
VIDEO IN A FAST WAY RATHER THAN 

774
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,283
SITTING AND WATCHING IT ALL IN 

775
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:51,883
REAL TIME. 

776
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:52,484
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

777
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:53,518
BASICALLY WHAT IT DOES IS 

778
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,520
ALLOWS US TO DO IN MINUTES OR 

779
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,621
SECONDS WHAT USE TODAY TAKE 

780
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:57,122
HOURS OR DAYS. 

781
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,991
>> TALK TO US ABOUT THIS KIND 

782
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:00,725
OF WORKPLACE. 

783
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:01,693
THIS IS A NEWSPAPER 

784
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:02,060
ORGANIZATION. 

785
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,327
>> RIGHT. 

786
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,996
>> WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU 

787
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:06,398
ABOUT WHAT KIND OF SITUATION 

788
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:06,765
THIS MIGHT BE? 

789
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,834
>> IT IS A GREAT QUESTION TOO. 

790
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:10,435
I THINK REALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT 

791
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,636
THIS THE PROBABILITY OF RISK AS 

792
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:13,205
WE BREAK THIS DOWN FROM THE 

793
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,140
BEHAVIOR SENSE IS ONE OF TWO 

794
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:15,373
THINGS. 

795
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:18,744
IT WILL BE AN EMPLOYEE OR A 

796
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,112
DISGRUNTLED EX-EMPLOYEE OR IT 

797
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,114
WILL BE SOMEONE WHO IS IN SOME 

798
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,181
WAY SHAPE OR FORM RELATED TO 

799
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:24,483
SOMETHING THAT THE NEWSPAPER 

800
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,785
HAS PRINTED THAT FEELS ANGRY OR 

801
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,520
SOME LEVEL OF DISDAIN TOWARDS 

802
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,487
SOMETHING THAT THE NEWSPAPER 

803
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:30,088
HAS REPRESENTED. 

804
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,889
SO IT IS GOING TO BE -- IN ALL 

805
00:21:31,889 --> 00:21:33,392
LIKELIHOOD, IT WOULD BE ONE OF 

806
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:33,825
THE TWO THINGS. 

807
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,227
CAN'T LEAVE OUT THE FACT THAT 

808
00:21:35,227 --> 00:22:01,253
IT COULD ALSO 

809
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:06,758
THERE IS INFORMATION TO 

810
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:07,892
VALIDATE THAT, THEN WE WOULDN'T 

811
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:09,227
EVEN LOOK AT THAT AT THIS 

812
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:09,528
POINT. 

813
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:13,064
>> WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF 

814
00:22:13,064 --> 00:22:14,165
REPORTING ON LOCKDOWNS. 

815
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:14,699
SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID 

816
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:16,334
REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING THAT I 

817
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:18,570
LEARNED FROM AN INSTRUCTOR THAT 

818
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,604
DOES LOCKDOWNS AT SCHOOLS. 

819
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:20,672
WHEN YOU SEE ONE SHOOTER, THINK 

820
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,806
THAT THERE ARE TWO. 

821
00:22:21,806 --> 00:22:22,173
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

822
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:24,109
>> YOU ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE 

823
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,377
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND NEVER 

824
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,045
PUT YOUR GUARD DOWN, EVEN IF 

825
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,512
THAT ONE SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY. 

826
00:22:28,512 --> 00:22:28,779
>> RIGHT. 

827
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:31,583
AND THAT KEY -- THAT IS THE KEY 

828
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,183
PHRASE TO SITUATIONAL 

829
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:32,483
AWARENESS. 

830
00:22:32,483 --> 00:22:33,485
NEVER ASSUME THERE IS ONE. 

831
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,287
AND SO MANY TIMES WHEN WE HAVE 

832
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,354
COVERED THESE THINGS TOGETHER, 

833
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,856
SO MANY PEOPLE WILL ASSUME THAT 

834
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,791
THERE'S ONE PERSON, THERE IS 

835
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,558
ONLY ONE PERSON. 

836
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:43,495
THAT IS WHERE THE ARTIFICIAL 

837
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,063
INTELLIGENCE, THAT'S WHERE 

838
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,197
EXAMINING THE MEANS OF 

839
00:22:46,197 --> 00:22:47,232
GATHERING INTELLIGENCE THAT WE 

840
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:51,403
HAVE AVAILABLE TO US TODAY 

841
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,471
ENABLES US TO ASCERTAIN 

842
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,772
EXPEDITIOUSLY WAS THERE MORE 

843
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,474
THAN ONE PERSON AND IN FACT 

844
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:56,374
WHERE DID THEY COME FROM. 

845
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:57,509
>> OF COURSE YOU DON'T KNOW 

846
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,177
WHAT THE SECURITY LEVEL IS AT 

847
00:22:59,177 --> 00:22:59,577
THIS NEWSPAPER. 

848
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:01,546
BUT HOW MUCH OF A SOFT TARGET 

849
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,047
IS THIS. 

850
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,248
>> IT IS A BIG SOFT TARGET. 

851
00:23:04,248 --> 00:23:06,451
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. 

852
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:09,254
I HATE TO SAY THAT. 

853
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,089
I DON'T WANT TO CAST ASPERSIONS 

854
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:11,756
ABOUT THAT. 

855
00:23:11,756 --> 00:23:13,225
BUT WHEN YOU LEAVE MANHATTAN, 

856
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,893
EVEN GOING TO THE SUBURBS, 

857
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,963
LEVELS OF SECURITY WITH RESPECT 

858
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,865
TO ACCESS CONTROL FOR 

859
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:20,332
COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS 

860
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:20,632
DIMINISHES. 

861
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:21,266
AS YOU GET FURTHER AND FURTHER 

862
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,601
AWAY FROM NEW YORK, IT GETS 

863
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:23,068
LESS AND LESS. 

864
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,904
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 

865
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:26,837
SECURITY IS FOR THIS BUILDING. 

866
00:23:26,837 --> 00:23:28,740
BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY, THIS IS 

867
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,041
BUILDING TO BE EXAMINED IF THE 

868
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,544
PERSON ACTUALLY GOT IN THE 

869
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:32,811
BUILDING. 

870
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:34,613
AND IF THEY DID, HOW DID THEY 

871
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,047
GET INTO THE BUILDING? 

872
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:36,481
THROUGH THE FRONT? 

873
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,851
DID THEY HAVE TO SHOW ID? 

874
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:40,584
WERE THEY ESCORTED. 

875
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:42,421
ALL OF THESE THINGS WILL COME 

876
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,922
INTO ACCOUNT WHEN WE PEEL THIS 

877
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,891
BACK AFTER TO SEE HOW THIS 

878
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:46,191
TRANSPIRED. 

879
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,727
>> PAUL, WE JUST GOT TWEETS 

880
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:52,097
FROM A REPORTER WHO WAS IN THE 

881
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:52,464
ROOM. 

882
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:53,765
THIS REPORTER PHIL DAVIS SAYS 

883
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,801
THERE IS NOTHING MORE 

884
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:56,668
TERRIFYING THAN HEARING 

885
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,303
MULTIPLE PEOPLE GOT SHOT WHILE 

886
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,270
YOU'RE UNDER YOUR DESK. 

887
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,007
AND THEN HEAR THE GUNMAN 

888
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:02,541
RELOAD. 

889
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,074
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE. 

890
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:06,044
WHAT A TERRIFYING MOMENT FOR 

891
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:06,544
EVERYONE IN THAT ROOM. 

892
00:24:06,544 --> 00:24:08,280
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE LOSS FOR 

893
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,547
THOSE THAT LOST THEIR LIVES. 

894
00:24:09,547 --> 00:24:10,949
>> IT IS LIFE-CHANGING. 

895
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:11,316
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

896
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:12,551
>> THIS PERSON ALSO TWEETED 

897
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,019
GUNMAN SHOT THROUGH THE GLASS 

898
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,922
DOOR TO THE OFFICE AND OPENED 

899
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:17,989
FIRE ON MULTIPLE EMPLOYEES. 

900
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,292
CAN'T SAY MUCH MORE AND DON'T 

901
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,326
WANT TO DECLARE ANYONE DEAD. 

902
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:23,528
WE DO KNOW THERE ARE FOUR 

903
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:24,162
PEOPLE DEAD. 

904
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:27,264
LET'S BRING IN CBS NEWS JUSTICE 

905
00:24:27,264 --> 00:24:28,400
AND HOMELAND SECURITY 

906
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,067
CORRESPONDENT JEFF IN 

907
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:29,367
WASHINGTON. 

908
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:32,003
HE HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO HIS 

909
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:32,270
SOURCES. 

910
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,172
WHAT IS THE LATEST THAT YOU 

911
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:34,539
HAVE LEARNED. 

912
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,174
>> RELATIVELY EARLY ON YOU HAVE 

913
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,809
THIS REPORT THAT THERE IS 

914
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,110
SOMEONE IN CUSTODY. 

915
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,245
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PERSON, HE 

916
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:44,249
OR SHE, THE PERSON WHO IS IN 

917
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:44,816
CUSTODY, IS STILL ALIVE. 

918
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,452
AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE A 

919
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:48,687
SITUATION LIKE THIS, THIS IS 

920
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:49,854
SOMEONE OBVIOUSLY WHO CAN 

921
00:24:49,854 --> 00:24:52,057
PROVIDE INVESTIGATORS WITH THE 

922
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:52,991
INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED. 

923
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,728
THAT SAID, THIS IS STILL VERY 

924
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:57,295
MUCH AN ONGOING SITUATION. 

925
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:57,862
INVESTIGATORS TYPICALLY IN 

926
00:24:57,862 --> 00:24:58,830
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS, THEY HAVE 

927
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,466
TO CLEAR THE BUILDING AND MAKE 

928
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:04,669
SURE THAT THERE ARE NO 

929
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,102
SECONDARY THREATS. 

930
00:25:05,102 --> 00:25:07,205
WHETHER THAT BE SOME SORT OF A 

931
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,173
DEVICE OR SOME OTHER THREAT. 

932
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,274
YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT IS 

933
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,041
SOMETHING THAT IS HAPPENING 

934
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,810
RIGHT NOW. 

935
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:50,048
>> THAT SHOULD SOMETHING THAT 

936
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,816
CAN HAPPEN WITHIN THE NEXT 12 

937
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:52,651
TO 24 HOURS. 

938
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:56,588
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE FBI WHO 

939
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,023
WILL OBVIOUSLY HELP SEARCHING 

940
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,792
DAYS ABASES, THINGS LIKE THAT 

941
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:01,692
TO GATHER AS MUCH INFORMATION. 

942
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:02,894
AS INVESTIGATORS SEARCH FOR A 

943
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:03,328
MOTIVE. 

944
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:04,796
BECAUSE THAT IS THE QUESTION 

945
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:04,996
HERE. 

946
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:07,966
YOU HAVE THIS BUILDING THAT 

947
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:12,103
HOUSES THIS LOCAL PAPER, THE 

948
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:12,737
CAPITAL GAZETTE TARGETED HERE. 

949
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,806
THE QUESTION AS YOU HAVE 

950
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,307
DISCUSSED, ADRIANA, IF THIS IS 

951
00:26:16,307 --> 00:26:18,109
SOMEONE WHO HAD A GRIEVANCE 

952
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:21,646
AGAINST THIS PAPER OR THIS IS 

953
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:22,480
SOMEONE WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON 

954
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,816
HAS NO CONNECTION TO THE PAPER 

955
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,317
BUT TARGETED THE PAPER ON THIS 

956
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:27,485
DAY. 

957
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:30,388
THE FACT THAT THIS PERSON WAS 

958
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,490
INSIDE THE BUILDING OBVIOUSLY 

959
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,059
GIVEN SECURITY THESE DAYS 

960
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,293
RAISES ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS 

961
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:38,063
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT TYPE OF 

962
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,898
ACCESS MAY HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE 

963
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:40,265
TO THIS PERSON. 

964
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,700
WAS THIS SOMEONE WHO WORKED 

965
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,835
THERE OR HAD SOME SORT OF 

966
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:44,235
CONNECTION THERE. 

967
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:47,272
THESE ARE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE 

968
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:47,872
DISCUSSED THAT INVESTIGATORS 

969
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,274
ARE GOING OVER RIGHT NOW AS 

970
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:49,474
WELL. 

971
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,609
AND IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THAT, 

972
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:53,345
YOU HAVE THE RESPONSE FOR THE 

973
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,012
LOCAL COMMUNITY THERE. 

974
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,780
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN 

975
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,851
THIS AREA, WHO LIVE AROUND THIS 

976
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:02,087
AREA, WHO ARE OBVIOUSLY 

977
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:02,687
TERRIFIED RIGHT NOW. 

978
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:04,122
WHAT THEY HAVE WITNESSED IS 

979
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,590
THIS LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE 

980
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,625
WHICH HAD SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES 

981
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:08,525
SCREAMING INTO THIS LOCATION. 

982
00:27:08,525 --> 00:27:10,028
YOU HAVE LOCAL POLICE AS WELL 

983
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:13,298
AS THE ATF AND THE FBI. 

984
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,565
SO YOU HAVE THIS HUGE LAW 

985
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:15,099
ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE. 

986
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:18,136
AND SO YOU HAVE CITY OFFICIALS 

987
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,672
THERE IN ANNAPOLIS TRYING TO 

988
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,040
COORDINATE THEIR RESPONSE TO 

989
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,975
THE COMMUNITY AND THE KEY THAT 

990
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,044
WE HAVE SEEN THROUGHOUT SIMILAR 

991
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:27,679
INCIDENTS LIKE THIS ONE IS THAT 

992
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,647
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR LOCAL 

993
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,349
OFFICIALS TO GET THE WORD OUT 

994
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:33,284
TO THE COMMUNITY AS SOON AS 

995
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:33,918
POSSIBLE. 

996
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:39,224
WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY PRESS 

997
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:39,624
CONFERENCES YET. 

998
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:44,261
BUT WE SUSPECT THAT WILL HAPPEN 

999
00:27:44,261 --> 00:27:45,063
MOMENTARILY. 

1000
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:48,433
>> THEY ARE SETTING UP A MEDIA 

1001
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:49,467
STAGING AREA. 

1002
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,202
FAMILIES ARE BEING TOLD TO 

1003
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,104
REUNITE WITH THEIR LOVED ONES 

1004
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:57,141
AT A LOCAL LORD & TAYLOR. 

1005
00:27:57,141 --> 00:28:01,713
IT SEEMS THAT THESE ACTIVE 

1006
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:05,183
SHOOTER SWAYINGS ARE BECOMING 

1007
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,584
MORE -- SITUATIONS ARE BECOMING 

1008
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:07,118
MORE AND MORE. 

1009
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:14,959
>> THEY HAVE HAD TO UPDATE THE 

1010
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,062
STRATEGIES. 

1011
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:21,566
EVERY SHOOTING PRESENTS A NEW 

1012
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:22,367
DILEMMA FOR RESPONDING TO THESE 

1013
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:22,667
INCIDENTS. 

1014
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:27,272
SO THEY HAVE HAD TO OVER THE 

1015
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:28,840
YEARS UPDATE THEIR RESPONSE 

1016
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,140
PROCEDURES. 

1017
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,940
DURING THE COLUMBINE INCIDENT 

1018
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,376
IT WAS DETERMINED THAT, YOU 

1019
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,812
KNOW, POLICE TOOK TOO LONG TO 

1020
00:28:33,812 --> 00:28:34,112
MOVE IN. 

1021
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:37,549
AND THEN SINCE THEN, OVER THE 

1022
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,083
COUPLE OF DECADES ALMOST SINCE 

1023
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:40,752
THEN, THERE HAS BEEN THIS 

1024
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,720
CHANGE IN APPROACH IN THAT LAW 

1025
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,622
ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT WAIT TO GO 

1026
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:45,523
INTO SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. 

1027
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:47,792
WHAT THEY TRY TO DO IS GET IN 

1028
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,294
THE FIRST OFFICERS ON THE SCENE 

1029
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:53,131
ARE SUPPOSED TO GET INTO THE 

1030
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,332
BUILDING AND RESPOND AND 

1031
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:55,333
NEUTRALIZE THE TARGET AS FASTED 

1032
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:55,700
AS THEY CAN. 

1033
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,202
WHETHER THAT HAPPENED IN THIS 

1034
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:57,935
CASE, IT SOUNDS LIKE IT. 

1035
00:28:57,935 --> 00:28:59,838
GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE 

1036
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,472
REPORTING THAT THERE HAS BEEN 

1037
00:29:01,472 --> 00:29:05,142
AN ARREST, SOMEBODY IS IN 

1038
00:29:05,142 --> 00:29:05,409
CUSTODY. 

1039
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:09,813
BUT THAT IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING 

1040
00:29:09,813 --> 00:29:11,149
THAT INVESTIGATORS POST 

1041
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,884
OPERATION WILL LOOK INTO AS 

1042
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:13,284
WELL. 

1043
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,787
OVER THE YEARS, THE RESPONSE 

1044
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,955
TACTICS HAVE HAD TO EVOLVE. 

1045
00:29:17,955 --> 00:29:21,226
THESE ARE TEAMS OF LAW 

1046
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,560
ENFORCEMENT THAT TRAIN 

1047
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,361
REPEATEDLY IN THESE ACTIVE 

1048
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:24,963
SHOOTER SWAYINGS BECAUSE THEY 

1049
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,297
HAVE BEEN HAPPENING SO 

1050
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:26,865
FREQUENTLY. 

1051
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:32,737
>> JEFF, HOW MUCH OF A CONCERN 

1052
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:35,973
IS THE COPY CAT EFFECT? 

1053
00:29:35,973 --> 00:29:36,507
THESE SHOOTINGS HAPPEN. 

1054
00:29:36,507 --> 00:29:37,041
THEY'RE BROADCAST WIDELY. 

1055
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,509
HOW MUCH OF A CONCERN IS THERE 

1056
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:40,645
AND HOW MUCH ARE YOU HEARING 

1057
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:41,279
YOUR SOURCES TALK ABOUT THE 

1058
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,647
CONCERN OF WHETHER OR NOT 

1059
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:44,082
PEOPLE ARE SEEING THIS ON 

1060
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,118
TELEVISION AND WANTING TO DO 

1061
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,020
SOMETHING SIMILAR TO GET THAT 

1062
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,487
NOTORIETY? 

1063
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:05,436
>> FOR SOME REASON, IT 

1064
00:30:05,436 --> 00:30:07,105
MOTIVATES THE PEOPLE TO ACT OR 

1065
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,941
PERHAPS TO DELIVER SOME SORT OF 

1066
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:10,174
THREAT. 

1067
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:11,208
SOMETIMES OVER THE PHONE. 

1068
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:12,777
AND SO WHAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS 

1069
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,312
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THESE IS 

1070
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,714
THAT YOU HAVE THIS UPTICK IN 

1071
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:17,147
COPY CAT THREATS. 

1072
00:30:17,147 --> 00:30:18,850
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT 

1073
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,551
REALLY TIES UP LAW ENFORCEMENT. 

1074
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:22,053
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T JUST LET 

1075
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:24,722
THESE THINGS GO. 

1076
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:25,990
THEY HAVE TO INVESTIGATE. 

1077
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,159
WITH ALL OF THESE INCIDENTS 

1078
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,495
UNFOLDING ACROSS THE COUNTRY, 

1079
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,497
THERE ARE INVESTIGATORS WHO 

1080
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,798
FEAR THAT UNFORTUNATELY WHEN 

1081
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:36,100
PEOPLE SEE THESE IMAGES, IT 

1082
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,603
GETS IN THEIR HEADS AND IT CAN 

1083
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:39,837
LEAD TO COPY CAT INCIDENTS. 

1084
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:42,774
OBVIOUSLY WE HOPE THAT DOESN'T 

1085
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:43,241
HAPPEN IN THIS CASE. 

1086
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:44,776
AND OUR JOB OBVIOUSLY IS TO 

1087
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,711
REPORT THE NEWS AS IT IS 

1088
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:47,278
HAPPENING. 

1089
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:49,314
AND THIS IS A PUBLIC SERVICE 

1090
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:49,781
OBVIOUSLY. 

1091
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,316
ESPECIALLY AS THIS SITUATION IS 

1092
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,817
STILL UNFOLDING, THERE ARE 

1093
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:53,484
PEOPLE WATCHING THIS PROGRAM 

1094
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:54,819
RIGHT NOW TRYING TO GET 

1095
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,054
INFORMATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T 

1096
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,188
HAVE ANY INFORMATION FROM 

1097
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,490
OFFICIAL SOURCES JUST YET. 

1098
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,473
>> PERHAPS THERE ARE LOVED ONES 

1099
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,642
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN ESCORTED OUT 

1100
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:18,042
OF THE BUILDING. 

1101
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:18,442
THANK YOU, JEFF. 

1102
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:22,046
WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS THERE AN 

1103
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,882
ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION IN 

1104
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:27,351
ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND AT THE 

1105
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:27,918
CAPITAL GAZETTE NEWSPAPER. 

1106
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:29,487
IT IS OWNED BY THE BALTIMORE 

1107
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:29,720
SUN. 

1108
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,789
WE HAVE BEEN GETTING 

1109
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:32,423
INFORMATION FROM INSIDE THAT 

1110
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:32,690

1111
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,290
THERE ARE TWEET THAT'S HAVE 

1112
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,027
COME OUT FROM ONE OF THE

REPORTERS AT THE CAPITAL 

1114
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:37,594
GAZETTE. 

1115
00:31:37,594 --> 00:31:38,997
THIS REPORTER SAYS THAT A 

1116
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,865
SINGLE SHOOTER SHOT MULTIPLE 

1117
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,199
PEOPLE AT MY OFFICE. 

1118
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:44,936
SOME OF WHOM ARE DEAD. 

1119
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,070
CBS NEWS HAS CONFIRMED THAT 

1120
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,506
FOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN 

1121
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:48,873
THIS INCIDENT. 

1122
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:52,677
WE DO NOT KNOW IF THE INCIDENT 

1123
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:53,010
IS CONCLUDED. 

1124
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,813
WE DON'T KNOW IF THE THREAT IS 

1125
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:57,015
NEUTRALIZED BUT WHAT WE CAN 

1126
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,250
CONFIRM IS ONE PERSON IS IN 

1127
00:31:59,250 --> 00:31:59,517
CUSTODY. 

1128
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:00,385
WE SAW THE PICTURES THAT WE 

1129
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:01,719
HAVE SEEN TOO MANY TIMES OF 

1130
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:04,355
PEOPLE BEING LET OUT OF THAT 

1131
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,056
BUILDING WITH THEIR HANDS UP. 

1132
00:32:06,056 --> 00:32:07,759
I'M SURE FILLED WITH FEAR. 

1133
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,395
MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE MAY BE HAD 

1134
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:11,195
WITNESSED WHAT HAPPENED. 

1135
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:13,097
WE LEARNED ABOUT THIS AS WELL 

1136
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,198
FROM SOMEONE WHO WAS THERE. 

1137
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:16,401
SOMEONE WHO SAYS HE IS AN 

1138
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:19,804
INTERN AT THE CAPITAL GAZETTE 

1139
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:21,940
WHO TWEETED ACTIVE SHOOTER AT 

1140
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,273
888 BESTGATE. 

1141
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,240
THAT IS THE LOCATION. 

1142
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:27,144
AND HE WROTE PLEASE HELP US. 

1143
00:32:27,144 --> 00:32:29,680
LET'S BRING IN PAUL, A CBS NEWS 

1144
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,080
SECURITY ANALYST. 

1145
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,015
WHAT IS THE LATEST THAT YOU 

1146
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:31,482
HAVE LEARNED, PAUL. 

1147
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,217
>> THE LAST THING THAT I HEARD 

1148
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,019
IS THAT THEY ARE STILL TRYING 

1149
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,621
TO ASCERTAIN AND CONFIRM THERE 

1150
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,721
WAS ONLY ONE SHOOTER. 

1151
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:38,689
AND THEY HAVE NOT -- THEY HAVE 

1152
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:40,491
NOT MOVED PAST THAT AT THIS 

1153
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:40,724
POINT. 

1154
00:32:40,724 --> 00:32:41,759
THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY ONLY 

1155
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:42,059
HAVE ONE. 

1156
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:43,694
THEY BELIEVE THAT HE IS 

1157
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:43,994
CONTAINED. 

1158
00:32:43,994 --> 00:32:45,296
BUT THEY HAVEN'T GONE FORWARD 

1159
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,064
AND SAID THEY HAVE CONFIRMED 

1160
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:46,998
THERE WAS ONLY JUST ONE. 

1161
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:48,700
>> WHAT WILL IT TAKE FOR LAW 

1162
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,935
ENFORCEMENT TO KNOW THAT THE 

1163
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:51,702
SITUATION HAS BEEN NEUTRALIZED, 

1164
00:32:51,702 --> 00:32:53,571
THIS THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE 

1165
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:54,639
SHOOTER AND THERE ISN'T SOMEONE 

1166
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,642
ELSE HIDING OUT TRYING TO WAIT 

1167
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:57,909
THEM OUT? 

1168
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,343
>> SEVERAL THINGS. 

1169
00:32:59,343 --> 00:33:00,511
ONE, THEY'RE CREATING TWO 

1170
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:00,811
PERIMETERS. 

1171
00:33:00,811 --> 00:33:02,447
ONE IS THE OUTSIDE THAT POLICE 

1172
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:02,747
HAVE DONE. 

1173
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:05,650
MEANING NO ONE IS GOING TO GET 

1174
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,150
ON THE CAMPUS. 

1175
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,119
THE INSIDE PERIMETER IS WHERE 

1176
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:08,852
THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE. 

1177
00:33:08,852 --> 00:33:10,188
THEY'RE GOING TO LOCK THAT 

1178
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:10,421
DOWN. 

1179
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,123
AT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO KNOW 

1180
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,758
THAT THERE IS A DEVICE THAT THE 

1181
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,259
BOMB SQUAD IS GOING TO HAVE TO 

1182
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:17,728
VERIFY WHETHER OR NOT IT IS AN 

1183
00:33:17,728 --> 00:33:19,130
EXPLOSIVE DEVICE OR NOT. 

1184
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:19,864
SO THEY'RE EVACUATING THE 

1185
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:21,899
BUILDING AT THE SAME TIME 

1186
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,034
THEY'RE SETTING UP THE 

1187
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:23,334
PERIMETERS. 

1188
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,736
WHILE ALL OF THAT IS STILL 

1189
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,670
GOING ON, THEY NEED TO 

1190
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,739
ASCERTAIN THAT THROUGH -- 

1191
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:29,507
THROUGH CAMERAS THE GENESIS OF 

1192
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:32,076
WHEN THIS PERSON CAME ON THE 

1193
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,677
CAMPUS, WAS THIS PERSON WITH 

1194
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:34,044
SOMEBODY ELSE. 

1195
00:33:34,044 --> 00:33:35,680
THEY CAN -- IF THEY CAN VERIFY, 

1196
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,881
WHICH IS WHAT THEY'RE CLOSE TO 

1197
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:39,183
RIGHT NOW, IF THEY CAN VERIFY 

1198
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,418
HE WAS ALONE, THEN THEY KNOW 

1199
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,953
THEY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON AND 

1200
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:43,955
THE SITUATION IS CONTAINED AND 

1201
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,223
THE SCENE IS CONTAINED, ABSENT 

1202
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,225
THE DEVICE THAT THEY STILL HAVE 

1203
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:47,492
TO CHECK. 

1204
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:48,893
>> ONE OF THE LAST THINGS THAT 

1205
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,728
WE HEARD FROM POLICE IS THEY 

1206
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,496
ARE SEARCHING THE BUILDING. 

1207
00:33:52,496 --> 00:33:53,464
WHAT IS THE SYSTEMATIC WAY THAT 

1208
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:58,201
THEY TRY TO CLEAR THE BUILDING. 

1209
00:33:58,201 --> 00:34:00,538
IS THAT GOING FROM OUTSIDE IN 

1210
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,538
OR FLOOR TO FLORIDA. 

1211
00:34:01,538 --> 00:34:02,540
HOW DO THEY MAKE SURE THAT 

1212
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,811
SOMEONE IS NOT ON THE LOOSE 

1213
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:07,378
EVADING THEM. 

1214
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,478
>> THAT IS A PAIN STAKING LONG 

1215
00:34:08,478 --> 00:34:08,746
PROCESS. 

1216
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,915
I CAN TELL YOU WITHOUT ANY 

1217
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:11,916
HESITATION, THEY WILL START AT 

1218
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,118
THE BOTTOM FLOOR OF THIS 

1219
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:14,385
BUILDING. 

1220
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,786
EVERY SQUARE INCH WILL HAVE TO 

1221
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:17,120
BE CLEARED. 

1222
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,922
AND OFFICERS, TACTICAL OFFICERS 

1223
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:19,956
WILL COME IN FROM THE BOTTOM 

1224
00:34:19,956 --> 00:34:21,024
AND WORK THEIR WAY UP. 

1225
00:34:21,024 --> 00:34:22,393
FROM FLOOR TO FLOOR. 

1226
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,730
THEY WILL HAVE TO CLEAR ROOM BY 

1227
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:25,929
ROOM. 

1228
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:27,465
CLOSET BY CLOSET. 

1229
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,699
UNTIL THEY CAN ACTUALLY VERIFY 

1230
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,301
THAT THAT BUILDING IS CLEARED. 

1231
00:34:31,301 --> 00:34:34,071
>>> IT TAKES A LONG TO TO DO. 

1232
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:36,007
>> ACCORDING TO EYE REPORTER IN 

1233
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:36,340
THE ROOM. 

1234
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,875
HE SAYS THE SHOOTER SHOT 

1235
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:38,509
THROUGH A GLASS DOOR. 

1236
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,478
WHAT DOES IT TELL YOU ABOUT THE 

1237
00:34:41,478 --> 00:34:44,282
NATURE OF THE SHOOTING OR THE 

1238
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:44,681
WEAPON. 

1239
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:44,982
>> INTENT. 

1240
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:45,215
INTENT. 

1241
00:34:45,215 --> 00:34:46,217
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT -- 

1242
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,184
THINK ABOUT THIS. 

1243
00:34:47,184 --> 00:34:50,321
IF THIS WAS AN EMPLOYEE THAT 

1244
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:51,355
GOT DISCIPLINED TWO HOURS AGO, 

1245
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,491
FOUND THEY WEREN'T GETTING 

1246
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:54,192
PROMOTED OR FIRED, HIGHLY 

1247
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,494
<u>NLIKELY THEY WILL HAVE  </u>

1248
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:57,595
FIRE POWER ON THEM TO 

1249
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,996
PERPETRATE THIS TYPE OF EVENT. 

1250
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,831
THEY HAD PLANNED THIS TYPE OF 

1251
00:35:00,831 --> 00:35:01,131
EVENT OUT. 

1252
00:35:01,131 --> 00:35:02,433
THEY HAD THE FIRE POWER IN 

1253
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,034
ORDER TO DO THAT. 

1254
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:05,303
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF 

1255
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:05,670
GLASS THEY HAD. 

1256
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:08,072
SUFFICE IT TO SAY SOMEONE 

1257
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:08,605
PLANNED THIS THING OUT. 

1258
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:10,508
THAT MEANS IN ALL PROBLEM IT 

1259
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,309
WAS AN EX-EMPLOYEE OR SOMEBODY 

1260
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,677
THAT HAD THOUGHT THIS THING OUT 

1261
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,812
AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER, 

1262
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,280
POSSIBLY A FORMER SPOUSE THAT 

1263
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,049
CAME BACK ANGRY AT SOMEBODY IN 

1264
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,183
A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION. 

1265
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:21,886
OR IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY 

1266
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,455
THAT TRULY HAS DISDAIN TOWARDS 

1267
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:24,822
THE NEWSPAPER. 

1268
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:26,057
CLEARLY THAT TELLS ME THIS WAS 

1269
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,925
PLANNED OUT. 

1270
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:53,617
. 

1271
00:35:53,617 --> 00:35:55,486
>>> I'M SURE THERE ARE PLENTY 

1272
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,221
OF BAGS IN THE ROOM WHERE 

1273
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,656
PEOPLE HAD TO LEAVE QUICKLY. 

1274
00:35:59,656 --> 00:36:01,025
HOW DOES THE ATF DISCERN WHAT 

1275
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:12,670
IS A THREAT AND WHAT IS NOT? 

1276
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:19,109
>> JEWEL I KNOW AT THIS POINT 

1277
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:21,445
IS IT IS DESCRIBED AS A 

1278
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:21,712
PACKAGE. 

1279
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:24,115
IT HAS NOT BEEN DESCRIBED AS A 

1280
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:24,382
BACKPACK. 

1281
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,483
OR AS A BOX. 

1282
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,684
JUST A PACKAGE IT SELF. 

1283
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,285
BUT THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE 

1284
00:36:28,285 --> 00:36:30,721
CLEARED BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE 

1285
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:31,589
HAPPENS, AT THIS POINT. 

1286
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:32,623
>> Reporter: TO I WANT TO SHARE 

1287
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:34,225
WITH YOU WE HAVE GOTTEN WORD 

1288
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,027
THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND 

1289
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:36,927
MEDICAL CENTER HAS CONFIRMED 

1290
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:38,329
THEY HAVE ONE PATIENT INVOLVED 

1291
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,229
IN THIS SHOOTING. 

1292
00:36:39,229 --> 00:36:42,500
THAT MIGHT BE THE PATIENT THAT 

1293
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,536
WE SAW LOADED ON TO A 

1294
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,404
HELICOPTER EARLIER TODAY THAT 

1295
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,105
WAS OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING ON 

1296
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:48,639
A GURNEY. 

1297
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,208
LOADED ON TO A HELICOPTER, 

1298
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,710
WHICH LEFT THAT AREA, 

1299
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,511
PRESUMABLY SOMEBODY WHO WAS 

1300
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:55,178
INJURED IN THIS SHOOTING. 

1301
00:36:55,178 --> 00:36:56,146
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE 

1302
00:36:56,146 --> 00:36:57,681
WERE INJURED IN THE SHOOTING. 

1303
00:36:57,681 --> 00:36:59,417
BUT THE FACT THAT FOUR PEOPLE, 

1304
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,851
FOUR WERE KILLED, WHAT DOES 

1305
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,519
THAT SAY TO YOU ABOUT THE 

1306
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:03,654
PROBABILITY THAT THERE ARE 

1307
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,222
MANY, MANY MORE INJURED, IF 

1308
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:08,159
FOUR WERE SHOT DEAD? 

1309
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,728
>> THERE IS ALMOST A CERTAINTY. 

1310
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,763
THE OTHER PART WE HAVE TO 

1311
00:37:12,763 --> 00:37:14,231
REMEMBER IS THE PEDIGREE OF THE 

1312
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:15,433
SHOOTER IS GOING TO TELL US A 

1313
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:16,967
LOT AND WE DON'T KNOW THE 

1314
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:19,003
WEAPON USED AND THE ROUNDS 

1315
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:19,203
USED. 

1316
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:20,805
AND THAT WILL TELL US A LOT AS 

1317
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:24,308
WELL, AS FAR AS THE PLANNING 

1318
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:27,211
AND THE MENS REA WITH REGARD TO 

1319
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:28,478
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT. 

1320
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:29,647
IN ALL PROBABILITY, TIMES THAT 

1321
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:30,981
BY TWO IF NOT THREE, WITH 

1322
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:32,549
RESPECT TO THE AMOUNT OF 

1323
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:33,584
INJURED, AND AS WELL AS THE 

1324
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,721
FACT THAT STILL, EVEN THOUGH WE 

1325
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,956
INITIALLY HAD AIR SUPPORT, AIR 

1326
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,124
MEDEVAC COMING IN, THEY ARE 

1327
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:41,092
STILL COMING IN. 

1328
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:41,959
THAT MEANS THERE ARE MORE 

1329
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:43,828
PEOPLE THAT ARE INJURED THAT WE 

1330
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,295
KNOW ABOUT, AT THIS POINT. 

1331
00:37:45,295 --> 00:37:46,731
>> WE HAVE TALKED A LOT ABOUT 

1332
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,566
HOW SCHOOLS ARE PREPARED FOR 

1333
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:52,036
THIS KIND OF EVENT, SCHOOLS 

1334
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:52,536
HAVE REGULAR LOCKDOWNS. 

1335
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,405
DO YOU THINK WORK PLACES ARE 

1336
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:54,905
SUFFICIENTLY PREPARED? 

1337
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:57,841
>> I DO NOT. 

1338
00:37:57,841 --> 00:37:59,476
WORK PLACES HAVE NOT DONE AS 

1339
00:37:59,476 --> 00:38:04,615
MUCH DUE DILIGENCE AS THEY NEED 

1340
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:04,948
TO DO. 

1341
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:06,717
ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK AT 

1342
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:08,119
PROVIDING A SAFE WORK 

1343
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:08,486
ENVIRONMENT. 

1344
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:09,520
HOW MANY PLACES OF BUSINESS PUT 

1345
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,490
THE TIME IN, TO MAKE SURE THEY 

1346
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,525
HAVE NOT JUST PROPER ACCESS 

1347
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:17,828
CONTROL, BUT EVACUATION 

1348
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:18,128
PROCEDURES. 

1349
00:38:18,128 --> 00:38:18,629
HOW MANY WORKPLACES ARE 

1350
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,930
PREPARED TO EVACUATE FOR A 

1351
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:20,331
FIRE? 

1352
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:20,531
OKAY. 

1353
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:21,732
BUT HOW MANY ARE PREPARED TO 

1354
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,834
EVACUATE FROM AN ACTIVE 

1355
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:24,134
SHOOTER? 

1356
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:24,501
NOT VERY MANY. 

1357
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:25,736
HOW MANY HAVE SPENT THE TIME TO 

1358
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:28,438
TRAIN AND EDUCATE THEIR STAFF 

1359
00:38:28,438 --> 00:38:29,106
ON THE VARIOUS NUANCES THAT 

1360
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,440
AFFECT THE WORKPLACE TODAY? 

1361
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,775
I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT WE 

1362
00:38:31,775 --> 00:38:34,612
ARE AS PREPARED AS WE SHOULD BE 

1363
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:35,279
AT THE WORKPLACE. 

1364
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:37,481
>>> IT HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT 

1365
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,316
MORE THAN AN HOUR SINCE THIS 

1366
00:38:39,316 --> 00:38:39,749
HAPPENED, ROUGHLY. 

1367
00:38:39,749 --> 00:38:41,218
WHAT DO YOU THINK POLICE ARE 

1368
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:41,519
DOING NOW? 

1369
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,954
DO YOU THINK THEY ARE STILL 

1370
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:44,755
GRASPING AT STRAWS FOR 

1371
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:45,088
INFORMATION? 

1372
00:38:45,088 --> 00:38:46,022
THEY HAVE ONE PERSON IN 

1373
00:38:46,022 --> 00:38:46,289
CUSTODY. 

1374
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:50,928
WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY'LL TAKE 

1375
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:51,461
THAT PERSON? 

1376
00:38:51,461 --> 00:38:52,463
>> LET'S START WITH THE FIRST 

1377
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:58,001
PART OF THAT QUESTION. 

1378
00:38:58,001 --> 00:38:59,937
UNEQUIVOCABLY, THEY'LL ISOLATE, 

1379
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:02,273
DECIDE WHO HAS JURISDICTION AND 

1380
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:02,773
START QUESTIONING. 

1381
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:07,211
>> JURISDICTION MEANING COUNTY 

1382
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:09,613
POLICE, ANNAPOLIS POLICE, FBI? 

1383
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:09,846
>> YES. 

1384
00:39:09,846 --> 00:39:11,182
JURISDICTION WILL BE DECIDED. 

1385
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,783
THAT IS WHO WILL START TALKING 

1386
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:13,016
TO HIM. 

1387
00:39:13,016 --> 00:39:14,585
GRANTED, THERE MAY BE MORE THAN 

1388
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,120
ONE AGENCY INVOLVED IN THAT 

1389
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,420
INTERVIEW. 

1390
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,688
THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT 

1391
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,022
THAT. 

1392
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,323
BUT REMEMBER THIS, AND THIS IS 

1393
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,024
THE IMPORTANT THING FOR OUR 

1394
00:39:21,024 --> 00:39:21,525
VIEWERS TO UNDERSTAND. 

1395
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,060
THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT 

1396
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,660
ASPECTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION 

1397
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,229
THAT ARE GOING TO GO ON 

1398
00:39:26,229 --> 00:39:26,596
SIMULTANEOUSLY. 

1399
00:39:26,596 --> 00:39:28,065
SO, AS THEY ARE DOING THAT, YOU 

1400
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:30,434
HAVE THE LEGAL SIDE OF THIS 

1401
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:31,735
TEAM, THAT IS GOING TO BE 

1402
00:39:31,735 --> 00:39:33,103
LOOKING FOR SEARCH WARRANTS ON 

1403
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:33,938
THE INDIVIDUAL'S HOME. 

1404
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:36,840
ON THE INDIVIDUAL'S COMPUTER, 

1405
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,808
PHONE, CAR, ET CETERA. 

1406
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,477
BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THAT 

1407
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,811
PRIMARY INFORMATION IS GOING TO 

1408
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,880
COME, AS WE START TO ASCERTAIN 

1409
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,082
THE PLANNING ASPECT OF THIS. 

1410
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,349
WHO DID THEY COMMUNICATE? 

1411
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:48,251
HOW DID THEY PLAN IT? 

1412
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:51,055
WHERE DID THEY GET THE WEAPON 

1413
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:51,522
FROM? 

1414
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,089
WEBSITES THAT THEY VISITED. 

1415
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:54,091
YOU MENTIONED TERRORISM BEFORE. 

1416
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:56,026
THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY 

1417
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,095
WE CAN'T SAY ANYTHING IN 

1418
00:39:58,095 --> 00:40:00,030
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS UNTIL WE 

1419
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,899
KNOW, WHO DID THEY SPEAK TO? 

1420
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,066
WHAT WERE THEY LOOKING AT? 

1421
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:04,435
WHO WERE THEY INVOLVED WITH? 

1422
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:06,470
SO THE LEGAL SIDE OF THIS IS 

1423
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,871
MOVING TOWARD SEARCH WARRANT. 

1424
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:09,406
ONCE THAT IS OBTAINED, THEN OF 

1425
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:11,175
COURSE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE 

1426
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:12,042
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT TEAMS 

1427
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,510
EXECUTE THAT GO SEARCH WARRANT. 

1428
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,346
THAT INFORMATION WILL BE 

1429
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:15,813
OBTAINED. 

1430
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,414
ONCE OBTAINED, IT WILL BE 

1431
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:18,014
ANALYZED AND THEN THERE IS 

1432
00:40:18,014 --> 00:40:20,050
GOING TO BE A WHOLE NEW WITNESS 

1433
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,920
LIST AS TO WHO WE NEED TO SPEAK 

1434
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,454
TO. 

1435
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:24,522
WHO WAS HE E-MAILING? 

1436
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:25,622
WHO WAS HE TEXTING? 

1437
00:40:25,622 --> 00:40:27,491
WHO DID HE SPEAK TO RIGHT 

1438
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:29,260
BEFORE HE WALKED IN THE 

1439
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:29,526
BUILDING? 

1440
00:40:29,526 --> 00:40:30,127
ALL THESE THINGS WILL COME AS 

1441
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,595
PART OF THE INVESTIGATION. 

1442
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,429
>> PROBABLY GET THE SUSPECT'S 

1443
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:34,632
CELL PHONE AND GO THROUGH THAT 

1444
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,233
AS WELL. 

1445
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:36,800
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. 

1446
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,635
TEXT MESSAGES, E-MAILS, CELL 

1447
00:40:38,635 --> 00:40:40,804
PHONE, ALL THAT WILL COME AS 

1448
00:40:40,804 --> 00:40:43,307
PART OF THE SEARCH WARRANT. 

1449
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:43,940
INVESTIGATORS WILL THEN START 

1450
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,177
STAGE II OF THE INVESTIGATION 

1451
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:49,013
TO SEE THE GENESIS OF THIS. 

1452
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,814
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM? 

1453
00:40:50,814 --> 00:40:52,416
WHO ELSE MAY HAVE BEEN 

1454
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:53,083
INVOLVED? 

1455
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:56,854
>> PAUL, LET'S GO BACK TO CBS 

1456
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,321
NEWS AND HOMELAND SECURITY 

1457
00:40:58,321 --> 00:40:59,790
CORRESPONDENT, JEFF WHAT IS THE 

1458
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,090
LATE NEST. 

1459
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,458
>> I WANTED TO BUILD ON A POINT 

1460
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:02,960
THAT YOU WERE BOTH MAKING THERE 

1461
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,663
AND THAT IS ABOUT THESE 

1462
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:06,464
ELECTRONIC DEVICES. 

1463
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,265
WHAT WE HAVE FOUND, AND 

1464
00:41:09,265 --> 00:41:12,536
INVESTIGATORS HAVE TOLD US IN 

1465
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:13,671
INCIDENTS LIKE THIS, ONCE THEY 

1466
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,473
GET THEIR HANDS ON ELECTRONIC 

1467
00:41:16,473 --> 00:41:17,908
DEVICES, A PHONE OR COMPUTER, 

1468
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:24,148
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. 

1469
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,282
IT GIVES SO MUCH INFORMATION 

1470
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,117
ABOUT THE LAST FEW MINUTES AND 

1471
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:27,751
LAST FEW WEEKS. 

1472
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:30,754
THIS IS INFORMATION THEY WILL 

1473
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:35,459
USE TO THEN PIECE TOGETHER A 

1474
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:36,226
MOTIVE. 

1475
00:41:36,226 --> 00:41:37,260
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN? 

1476
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:42,266
THAT IS THE QUESTION OF ALL OF 

1477
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:47,604
THE ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATIONS. 

1478
00:41:47,604 --> 00:41:49,506
>> AT THIS POINT I CAN CONFIRM 

1479
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:51,075
WE DO HAVE INJURIES. 

1480
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:54,645
WE DID HAVE AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 

1481
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:55,446

WE HAVE INJURIES. 

1484
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,817
I CAN'T GIVE THE EXTENT OF 

1485
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:05,322
THOSE INJURIES, AT THIS POINT. 

1486
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:08,225
WE DO -- DON'T EXPECT THIS TO 

1487
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:10,394
HAVE MAJOR CASUALTIES OR 

1488
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:11,428
SEVERAL HUNDRED CASUALTIES. 

1489
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:13,563

1490
00:42:13,563 --> 00:42:14,698

IT IS ONE SUSPECT, BUT AGAIN, 

1552
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,423

00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:53,097
JUST ONE SUSPECT. 

1558
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:54,431
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE IS 

1559
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:55,933

FAMILIES. 

1572
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:13,317
ONCE THAT BUILDING IS SECURE, 

1573
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,218
WE CAN PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION 

1574
00:44:15,218 --> 00:44:15,953

1621
00:45:33,296 --> 00:45:35,799
HE SAID WE DID HAVE AN ACTIVE 

1622
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:36,232
SHOOTER SITUATION. 

1623
00:45:36,232 --> 00:45:37,467
HE SAID THEY ARE STILL SECURING 

1624
00:45:37,467 --> 00:45:38,068
THE BUILDING. 

1625
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:38,702

KNEW, THERE IS ONE SUSPECT IN 

1627
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:42,039
CUSTODY. 

1628
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,073
BUT HE SAID HE BELIEVES THERE 

1629
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,042
IS ONLY ONE, BUT HE CANNOT SAY 

1630
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,577
THAT YET WITH CERTAINTY. 

1631
00:45:47,577 --> 00:45:48,445
DID NOT GIVE MUCH INFORMATION 

1632
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:49,545

1633
00:45:49,545 --> 00:45:50,480
HE SAID THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE 

1634
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,416

WOULD NOT TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR 

1636
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:55,719
NOT ANYONE HAS BEEN KILLED. 

1637
00:45:55,719 --> 00:45:57,321
CBS NEWS, OF COURSE, HAS 

1638
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:58,222

INCIDENT. 

1641
00:46:01,924 --> 00:46:02,558
THE FOCUS FROM THE LIEUTENANT 

1642
00:46:02,558 --> 00:46:04,228
WAS REALLY JUST FOR PUBLIC 

1643
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:04,461
SAFETY. 

1644
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,129
KEEPING PEOPLE AWAY FROM THAT

REUNITE WITH THEM AT A LOCAL 

1649
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:13,437
MALL. 

1650
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,205
HE DID SPECIFY THAT THE CAPITAL 

1651
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:15,973
GAZETTE IS NOT THE ONLY 

1652
00:46:15,973 --> 00:46:17,674

00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:19,209

1655
00:46:20,711 --> 00:46:23,580
LET'S GO BACK TO CBS NEWS, 

1656
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,183
JUSTICE AND HOMELAND SECURITY 

1657
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:26,817
CORRESPONDENT. 

1658
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:27,751
JEFF, WHAT IS YOUR TAKE? 

1659
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:29,519
>> WELL THIS IS PRETTY 

1660
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:30,554
TEXTBOOK, HOW THEY ARE 

1661
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:31,255
RESPONDING TO THIS. 

1662
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,756
AS WE TOLD OUR VIEWERS, THERE 

1663
00:46:32,756 --> 00:46:35,225
WOULD BE SOME SORT OF PRESS 

1664
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:35,559
BRIEFING. 

1665
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:36,326
THE PRESS BRIEFING THAT WE GOT, 

1666
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:38,762
THERE WASN'T A LOT OF 

1667
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:39,529
INFORMATION, AND THAT IS 

1668
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:42,466
SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD EXPECT, 

1669
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,500
AT THIS MOMENT. 

1670
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,969
OBVIOUSLY IT IS STILL EARLY IN 

1671
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:46,469
THIS INVESTIGATION. 

1672
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:47,771
NOW THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 

1673
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,338
INFORMATION ON THE SUSPECT. 

1674
00:46:49,338 --> 00:46:50,540
BUT THEY BELIEVE THAT IT IS 

1675
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,241
JUST ONE SUSPECT. 

1676
00:46:52,241 --> 00:46:53,777
SO THAT IS IMPORTANT. 

1677
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:55,245
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT 

1678
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:57,114
THIS IS AN OPEN AND SHUT CASE, 

1679
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:58,081
IN TERMS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING 

1680
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,549
THERE ON THE SCENE. 

1681
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:01,785
THEY STILL HAVE TO GO ROOM TO 

1682
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:04,855
ROOM IN AND SEARCH FOR ANY SORT 

1683
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:05,922
OF SECONDARY THREATS. 

1684
00:47:05,922 --> 00:47:07,224
WHAT IS ALSO TEXTBOOK HERE IS 

1685
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:11,128
WHAT HE WAS SAYING ABOUT THE 

1686
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:11,661
REUNIFICATION PROCESS. 

1687
00:47:11,661 --> 00:47:13,664
THE LAST THING THEY WANT ARE 

1688
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,531
FAMILY MEMBERS RUSHING TO THE 

1689
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:16,533
SCENE AND PERHAPS PUTTING 

1690
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:17,334
THEMSELVES IN DANGER. 

1691
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,770
SO WHAT THEY HAVE ADVISED IS 

1692
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,338
THAT THESE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO 

1693
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,441
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLE THEY 

1694
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:25,609
KNOW, WHO MAY HAVE BEEN IN THE, 

1695
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:27,744
INVOLVED IN THE ACTIVE SHOOTER 

1696
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:29,913
SITUATION IN SOME WAY, THEY ARE 

1697
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:32,215
ASKING THEM TO MEET AT A NEARBY 

1698
00:47:32,215 --> 00:47:34,551
MALL IN THE LORD & TAYLOR. 

1699
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,653
AND SO THAT MAY HAVE BEEN ONE 

1700
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:37,554
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS 

1701
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:39,923
OF THE INFORMATION THAT HE WAS 

1702
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:40,891
TRYING TO COMMUNICATE THERE 

1703
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:43,560
THAT, THEY HAVE SET UP A REUNI 

1704
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,129
CATION PROCESS AND THAT, AS I 

1705
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:47,731
SAID, IS TEXTBOOK. 

1706
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:51,268
THE FBI, BY THE WAY, SENDS OUT 

1707
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:52,569
A VIDEO TO HELP INSTRUCT LOCAL 

1708
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:54,938
POLICE DEPARTMENT ON HOW TO 

1709
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:55,806
RESPOND IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS 

1710
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,942
AND THAT IS THE KIND OF 

1711
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:00,410
RESPONSE THAT THAT VIDEO 

1712
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:00,677
OUTLINES. 

1713
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,646
THAT SAID, THERE IS STILL A LOT 

1714
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:03,847
OF UNCERTAINTY THERE. 

1715
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:06,249
YOU COULD TELL THAT THE OFFICER 

1716
00:48:06,249 --> 00:48:06,983
WHO DELIVERED THAT INFORMATION 

1717
00:48:06,983 --> 00:48:09,953
MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT 

1718
00:48:09,953 --> 00:48:10,220
NERVOUS. 

1719
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,856
HE TALKED ABOUT THIS NOT BEING 

1720
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:15,759
A MASS CASUALTY EVENT WITH 

1721
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:17,126
HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS. 

1722
00:48:17,126 --> 00:48:19,262
I'M SURE HE MIGHT LOOK BACK ON 

1723
00:48:19,262 --> 00:48:21,164
THAT AND REGRET PUTTING IT IN 

1724
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:21,497
THOSE WORDS. 

1725
00:48:21,497 --> 00:48:23,634
BUT THEY ARE CONFIDENT, IT 

1726
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:24,868
SEEMS, JUST BASED ON WHAT HE 

1727
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:27,370
WAS TELLING US THERE, THAT THE 

1728
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:29,439
SITUATION APPEARS TO BE UNDER 

1729
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:29,706
CONTROL. 

1730
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:30,640
AS WE HAVE REPORTED THERE ARE 

1731
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,408
FOUR DEAD. 

1732
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:32,909
THERE MAY BE MORE INJURED. 

1733
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:35,746
WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET AND 

1734
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:36,713
OFFICIALS HAVE NOT CON NAMED. 

1735
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:38,115
BUT OBVIOUSLY, THEY ARE TRYING 

1736
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:39,916
TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION OUT 

1737
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:43,220
AS FAST AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN. 

1738
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,254
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE AN AWFUL 

1739
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,955
LOT TO GO ON. 

1740
00:48:45,955 --> 00:48:47,958
BUT THE FACT THEY HAVE SOMEONE 

1741
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:49,659
IN CUSTODY, WELL THAT GIVES 

1742
00:48:49,659 --> 00:48:50,861
THEM SOMETHING IMPORTANT, 

1743
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:53,729
OBVIOUSLY TO GO ON. 

1744
00:48:53,729 --> 00:48:54,364
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

1745
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:57,067
IT, WHEN HE DID SAY IT WASN'T A 

1746
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,402
MASS CASUALTY EVENT, OF COURSE 

1747
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:01,671
YOU THINK ANY ONE DEATH IS ONE 

1748
00:49:01,671 --> 00:49:02,973
TOO MANY. 

1749
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:05,342
THAT LIEUTENANT WAS GIVING THE 

1750
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:05,842
INFORMATION. 

1751
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:07,811
>> HE WAS ABLE TO GIVE, WHEN WE 

1752
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:09,446
REPORT THESE STORIES, 

1753
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,113
OFTENTIMES WHEN YOU SPEAK TO 

1754
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,349
LAW ENFORCEMENT AT FIRST, THERE 

1755
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:13,183
IS VERY LITTLE INFORMATION THEY 

1756
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:14,483
ARE ABLE TO RELEASE. 

1757
00:49:14,483 --> 00:49:15,919
THEY HAVE THE SUSPECT IN 

1758
00:49:15,919 --> 00:49:16,186
CUSTODY. 

1759
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:16,953
JEFF, WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE 

1760
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:19,022
GOING TO BE THE KEY QUESTIONS 

1761
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:19,923
THEY ARE ASKING THAT PERSON. 

1762
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:21,658
>> THEY WANT TO KNOW WHY. 

1763
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:22,625
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU 

1764
00:49:22,625 --> 00:49:23,927
KNOW, IF YOU ARE INVESTIGATING 

1765
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:29,399
THIS, YOU WANT TO GET TO RIGHT 

1766
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:30,033
AWAY. 

1767
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,201
IF THIS IS SOMEONE WHO WAS 

1768
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:31,868
COOPERATING WITH INVESTIGATORS, 

1769
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:34,304
THAT IS THE QUESTION YOU WANT 

1770
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:34,837
TO ASK IMMEDIATELY. 

1771
00:49:34,837 --> 00:49:36,106
WHY DID YOU DO THIS? 

1772
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:39,176
HOW DID YOU DO THIS? 

1773
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:40,510
BUT YOU DON'T JUST TRUST WHAT 

1774
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:41,744
THIS PERSON IS SAYING. 

1775
00:49:41,744 --> 00:49:46,550
YOU ALSO HAVE TO SEARCH HOMES, 

1776
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:47,850
SEARCH COMPUTERS, CELL PHONES. 

1777
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:51,088
YOU GET WARRANTS TO SEARCH 

1778
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:52,788
THOSE DEVICES AND SO THERE ARE 

1779
00:49:52,788 --> 00:49:54,091
DIFFERENT PIECES OF THIS 

1780
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:55,024
INVESTIGATION ALREADY UNDERWAY. 

1781
00:49:55,024 --> 00:49:56,026
WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS WHAT IS 

1782
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:57,994
HAPPENING AT THE SCENE. 

1783
00:49:57,994 --> 00:49:59,329
BUT BEHIND THE SCENES, THERE IS 

1784
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:02,532
A LOT GOING ON AS WELL. 

1785
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:04,468
THERE ARE TEAMS OF 

1786
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:06,336
INVESTIGATORS NOW WORKING TO 

1787
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,738
LOOK AT WHAT ELSE MIGHT HAVE 

1788
00:50:08,738 --> 00:50:10,173
BEEN HAPPENING AROUND THIS 

1789
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:13,310
INCIDENT OR LEADING UP TO THIS 

1790
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:13,577
INCIDENT. 

1791
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:15,512
BUT WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT A 

1792
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,547
QUICK RESOLUTION IN TERMS OF 

1793
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:19,916
FINDING A MOTIVE FOR THIS, EVEN 

1794
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,551
IF INVESTIGATORS HAVE A GOOD 

1795
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:23,987
IDEA OF WHAT MAY HAVE MOTIVATED 

1796
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:25,655
THIS INCIDENT, THEY MIGHT STILL 

1797
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:26,489
HOLD BACK. 

1798
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:28,191
THEY DON'T WANT TO PUT 

1799
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,192
EVERYTHING OUT THERE IN THE 

1800
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,361
FIRST FEW HOURS LIKE THIS. 

1801
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,762
YOU REALLY HAVE TO GET YOUR 

1802
00:50:32,762 --> 00:50:34,965
DUCKS IN A ROW BEFORE YOU MAKE 

1803
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:35,465
PUBLIC STATEMENTS. 

1804
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:37,233
AGAIN, THAT IS PROBABLY WHY THE 

1805
00:50:37,233 --> 00:50:38,268
OFFICER WHO DELIVERED THAT 

1806
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:39,870
BRIEFING DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF 

1807
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,605
INFORMATION TO GO ON. 

1808
00:50:42,605 --> 00:50:44,006
THERE WAS PROBABLY INFORMATION 

1809
00:50:44,006 --> 00:50:45,008
THAT HE KNEW THAT HE DIDN'T 

1810
00:50:45,008 --> 00:50:47,044
CONVEY TO US, AND THAT THERE IS 

1811
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,345
A REASON BEHIND THAT. 

1812
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:50,447
THEY DON'T WANT TO PUT TOO MUCH 

1813
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:50,947
OUT TOO SOON. 

1814
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:52,082
>> IT WAS INTERESTING THE 

1815
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:53,416
LIEUTENANT WAS ON THE PHONE AS 

1816
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:55,284
HE WAS GIVING THAT BRIEFING. 

1817
00:50:55,284 --> 00:50:57,287
I WONDER WHO HE WAS SPEAKING 

1818
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:57,721
TO. 

1819
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:58,555
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A REPORTER WHO 

1820
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,122
CALLED HIM OR A SUPERIOR. 

1821
00:51:00,122 --> 00:51:01,958
JEFF WE ARE GETTING NEW 

1822
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:04,427
INFORMATION ABOUT THE SUSPECT. 

1823
00:51:04,427 --> 00:51:05,462
ONE LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE 

1824
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,264
TELLS CBS NEWS THE SUSPECT HAD 

1825
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:08,665
NO ID WITH HIM. 

1826
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:13,236
HE IS MALE, WHITE, AND IN HIS 

1827
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:13,637
20s. 

1828
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:15,238
JEFF AS HE IS BEING QUESTIONED, 

1829
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,840
WHAT IF HE ASKS FOR A LAWYER? 

1830
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,141
>> IF HE IS BEING QUESTIONED 

1831
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:20,410
AND HE ASKS FOR A LAWYER, THEN 

1832
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,947
AT THAT POINT YOU HAVE TO STOP 

1833
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:24,347
QUESTIONING HIM. 

1834
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:25,448
TYPICALLY THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS 

1835
00:51:25,448 --> 00:51:27,150
ACCORDING TO THE LAW. 

1836
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,052
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY 

1837
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:29,285
ARE. 

1838
00:51:29,285 --> 00:51:30,754
OFTEN TIMES IN SITUATIONS LIKE 

1839
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:37,027
THESE, THESE SHOOTERS, THEY 

1840
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:37,861
WANT TO TALK. 

1841
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:40,897
THEY WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT TYPE 

1842
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:41,665
OF GRIEVANCE THEY HAVE HAD. 

1843
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:43,133
WHEN WHEN THE SHOOTER SURVIVES, 

1844
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:44,868
THAT IS WHAT YOU SEE, IS THAT 

1845
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:46,602
THERE IS A FOOTPRINT, PERHAPS 

1846
00:51:46,602 --> 00:51:49,039
THEY PUT SOME SORT OF IMAGE 

1847
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:50,940
ONLINE, OR PERHAPS THEY SAID 

1848
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:51,641
SOMETHING ONLINE WHICH WOULD 

1849
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:53,042
SUGGEST THAT THEY WERE IN A 

1850
00:51:53,042 --> 00:51:59,549
PLACE WHERE THEY COULD DO 

1851
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:15,365
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

1852
00:52:15,365 --> 00:52:17,700
>> IT MAKES ME THINK, OF COURSE 

1853
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:21,538
OF THE 2015 SHOOTING THAT LED 

1854
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:25,542
TO THE DEATH OF TWO TV STATION 

1855
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:25,842
REPORTERS. 

1856
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:28,111
THAT WAS STREAMED ONLINE. 

1857
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:30,547
THAT WAS RECORDED ONLINE AS A 

1858
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:31,948
WAY TO GET THAT NOTE RIGHT. 

1859
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:33,817
JEFF I'M GOING TO TURN TO PAUL. 

1860
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,252
PAUL AS JEFF WAS SPEAKING YOU 

1861
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:36,186
WERE NODDING YOUR HEAD. 

1862
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,020
>> JEFF IS ENTIRELY ON POINT. 

1863
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,856
THE THING WE HAVE TO LOOK AT 

1864
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:41,558
RIGHT NOW, REMEMBER, THEY ARE 

1865
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:42,124
SEARCHING THE BUILDING, 

1866
00:52:42,124 --> 00:52:43,360
CLEARING THE BUILDING AND 

1867
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:43,960
SEARCHING AT THE SAME TIME. 

1868
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,763
IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO 

1869
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:48,164
ASCERTAIN WHERE THIS SHOOTING 

1870
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:48,497
TOOK PLACE. 

1871
00:52:48,497 --> 00:52:52,769
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS, AS WE 

1872
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:53,837
LOOK, RETROACTIVELY BACK INTO 

1873
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,238
SHOOTINGS, WE LOOK AT WHERE 

1874
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:56,072
THIS TOOK PLACE. 

1875
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:58,341
DID IT TAKE PLACE IN ONE 

1876
00:52:58,341 --> 00:52:58,574
OFFICE? 

1877
00:52:58,574 --> 00:53:00,243
OR DID THIS INDIVIDUAL GO FROM 

1878
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:01,778
FLOOR TO FLOOR TO FLOOR? 

1879
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:02,946
THAT IS GOING TELL US WHY HE 

1880
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,048
CAME INTO THE BUILDING AND WHO 

1881
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:05,815
HE WAS LOOKING FOR AND 

1882
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:06,850
SPECIFICALLY, WHY HE WAS 

1883
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,351
LOOKING FOR THOSE PEOPLE. 

1884
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,519
IF IT OCCURRED THROUGHOUT THE 

1885
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,353
BUILDING, IT IS A DIFFERENT 

1886
00:53:11,353 --> 00:53:11,587
STORY. 

1887
00:53:11,587 --> 00:53:14,858
WE SAW, IN THE LAST ONE THAT WE 

1888
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,159
COVERED, WE SAW THIS INDIVIDUAL 

1889
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,728
WENT FOR ONE CLASSROOM, ONE 

1890
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:19,162
CLASSROOM ONLY. 

1891
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:20,297
NOW WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT 

1892
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:21,231
THIS BUILDING AND THEY ARE 

1893
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:24,167
GOING TO SEE NOT JUST THE SHELL 

1894
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:25,368
CASINGS AND THE WEAPON HE USED 

1895
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,569
BUT WHERE HE WENT. 

1896
00:53:26,569 --> 00:53:28,638
IT TELLS US WHY DID HE GO TO 

1897
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:29,672
THAT BUILDING TODAY? 

1898
00:53:29,672 --> 00:53:31,141
>> AND WHY, SPECIFICALLY, DID 

1899
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:34,944
HE GO INSIDE THAT BUILDINGTO 

1900
00:53:34,944 --> 00:53:35,545
WHERE HE WENT? 

1901
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,048
THAT IS GOING TO GIVE US THIS 

1902
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,949
GREAT MOSAIC REGARDING THE MENS 

1903
00:53:39,949 --> 00:53:41,551
REA OR THE INTENT. 

1904
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,453
>> WE DID HEAR FROM POLICE 

1905
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:45,088
THERE ARE MULTIPLE BUSINESS IN 

1906
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:45,821
HIS THAT BUILDING. 

1907
00:53:45,821 --> 00:53:47,357
SO IT IS POSSIBLE HE MAY HAVE 

1908
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:47,991
BEEN TARGETING JUST THAT 

1909
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:52,328
NEWSPAPER OR JUST THE BUILDING 

1910
00:53:52,328 --> 00:53:53,263
ITSELF, PERHAPS THIS SUSPECT 

1911
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:56,766
FOUND A WAY TO GET INTO THE 

1912
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:58,568
BUILDING, THEIR SECURITY WASN'T 

1913
00:53:58,568 --> 00:53:58,901
TIGHT ENOUGH. 

1914
00:53:58,901 --> 00:54:01,504
WE ARE LEARNING MORE FROM OUR 

1915
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:02,739
CBS NEWS REPORTERS AND 

1916
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,141
PRODUCERS THAT THE SUSPECT HAD 

1917
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:05,608
A SHOTGUN. 

1918
00:54:05,608 --> 00:54:08,044
WHAT DOES THAT INDICATE TO YOU? 

1919
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:08,511
>> VIOLENT DISDAIN. 

1920
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:10,780
I KNOW WHEN WE SAY THAT, PEOPLE 

1921
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:13,049
SAY PAUL, A SHOOTING IS 

1922
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:13,316
VIOLENT. 

1923
00:54:13,316 --> 00:54:14,784
A SHOTGUN IS UP CLOSE. 

1924
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:15,284
IT IS PERSONAL. 

1925
00:54:15,284 --> 00:54:16,786
THERE IS NO DISTANCE BEHIND 

1926
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:17,454
THAT. 

1927
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:18,188
AND YOU ARE INTENDING THIS TO 

1928
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:19,922
BE VIOLENT AND MESSY. 

1929
00:54:19,922 --> 00:54:21,757
IT IS PERSONAL. 

1930
00:54:21,757 --> 00:54:23,593
WHAT THAT TELLS ME IS THAT IS 

1931
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,995
GOING TO HAVE SOME SORT OF 

1932
00:54:25,995 --> 00:54:26,596
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP. 

1933
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:27,564
WHETHER IT BE AN INDIVIDUAL 

1934
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,065
THAT WAS FIRED THAT HOLDS 

1935
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,066
SOMEBODY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR 

1936
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:31,568
LOT IN LIFE OR AN INDIVIDUAL 

1937
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:32,569
THAT FIELDS THIS PARTICULAR 

1938
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,170
GIRL HE WAS DATING LEFT HIM FOR 

1939
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,138
THIS PARTICULAR GUY AND THEY 

1940
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:36,873
WERE IN THAT PARTICULAR OFFICE. 

1941
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:37,506
IT IS PERSONAL. 

1942
00:54:37,506 --> 00:54:40,043
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY THAT 

1943
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:40,643
PERSON USES THAT. 

1944
00:54:40,643 --> 00:54:42,445
BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF 

1945
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:46,249
VIOLENCE, A LOT OF HATRED, AND 

1946
00:54:46,249 --> 00:54:47,550
DISDAIN BEHIND USING THAT 

1947
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:51,955
SHOTGUN IN LIEU OF THAT 

1948
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:52,222
HANDGUN. 

1949
00:54:52,222 --> 00:54:53,189
SO THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES 

1950
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:54,758
REGARDING THE INTENT. 

1951
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,292
>> BECAUSE OF THE SHEER POWER 

1952
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:57,359
BEHIND A SHOTGUN? 

1953
00:54:57,359 --> 00:54:58,060
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT AND 

1954
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,462
THE DAMAGE IT IS GOING TO DO 

1955
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,565
AND HOW THAT IS GOING TO SPRAY. 

1956
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:03,366
ONE SHELL, FOR YOUR VIEWERS TO 

1957
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:04,868
UNDERSTAND, ONE SHELL FROM A 

1958
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:08,971
SHOTGUN IS GOING TO SPRAY A 

1959
00:55:08,971 --> 00:55:10,140
VARIETY OF PELLETS OR SMALL 

1960
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,841
BULLETS AROUND TO A SMALL AREA 

1961
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:12,174
OF PEOPLE. 

1962
00:55:12,174 --> 00:55:14,244
IT IS NOT JUST IF YOU HAD A GUN 

1963
00:55:14,244 --> 00:55:15,311
AND YOU WERE TO SHOOT ME. 

1964
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:17,847
IF IT IS A SHOTGUN, ANYBODY 

1965
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:19,449
AROUND THIS PARTICULAR AREA IS 

1966
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:19,949
ALL GETTING SHOT. 

1967
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:21,351
THERE IS AN INTENT BEHIND THAT 

1968
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:23,519
AND NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. 

1969
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:25,655
>> IT IS JUST HORRIFIC. 

1970
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,757
WE ARE ALSO HEARING MORE ABOUT 

1971
00:55:27,757 --> 00:55:28,124
THOSE INJURED. 

1972
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:30,493
WE ARE LEARNING FROM SOURCES 

1973
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:33,196
THAT THERE COULD BE FIVE PEOPLE 

1974
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,131
INJURED IN THIS INCIDENT. 

1975
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:37,267
WE KNOW THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE 

1976
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,301
WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED. 

1977
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:39,769
WE ARE SEEING A HEAVY POLICE 

1978
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:41,838
PRESENCE RIGHT NOW AT THIS 

1979
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:42,105
BUILDING. 

1980
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,140
THIS IS WHERE THE CAPITAL 

1981
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,442
GAZETTE IS BASE IN ANNAPOLIS, 

1982
00:55:46,442 --> 00:55:47,143
MARYLAND. 

1983
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:48,144
PEOPLE FROM THE BUILDING HAVE 

1984
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:50,547
BEEN ESCORTED OUT WITH THEIR 

1985
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:51,681
HANDS RAISED. 

1986
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,115
POLICE ARE THERE. 

1987
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:53,650
THEY HAVE BRIEFED THE MEDIA, 

1988
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:54,984
BUT THE INFORMATION WAS VERY 

1989
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:55,184
THIN. 

1990
00:55:55,184 --> 00:55:56,652
WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO TELL US 

1991
00:55:56,652 --> 00:55:58,688
IS THAT THEY ARE STILL CLEARING 

1992
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,154
THE BUILDING. 

1993
00:55:59,154 --> 00:56:00,156
THEY WERE ABLE TO TELL US THEY 

1994
00:56:00,156 --> 00:56:01,657
HAVE ONE PERSON IN CUSTODY AND 

1995
00:56:01,657 --> 00:56:06,596
THEY BELIEVE THERE IS ONLY ONE 

1996
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:07,329
PERSON INVOLVED. 

1997
00:56:07,329 --> 00:56:09,766
WHAT ABOUT THIS, PAUL, 

1998
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:10,133
SURPRISES YOU? 

1999
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,969
OR IS THIS SO FAR 

2000
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,303
UNFORTUNATELY, TEXTBOOK? 

2001
00:56:14,303 --> 00:56:16,106
>> IT REALLY IS TEXTBOOK. 

2002
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:17,873
I HATE TO SAY IT. 

2003
00:56:17,873 --> 00:56:19,042
I KNOW THAT IS NOT INFORMATION 

2004
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,977
THAT WE WANT TO SHARE. 

2005
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:22,478
BUT NO, IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME. 

2006
00:56:22,478 --> 00:56:23,746
DOESN'T SURPRISE ME AT ALL. 

2007
00:56:23,746 --> 00:56:26,049
THE FACT A FIRE IS USED, THE 

2008
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,816
FACT A SHOTGUN IS USED, THE 

2009
00:56:27,816 --> 00:56:29,986
FACT IT IS OCCURRING IN A 

2010
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:30,987
WORKPLACE, THE FACT IT IS 

2011
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:32,188
OCCURRING DURING WORK HOURS, 

2012
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:34,056
THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T 

2013
00:56:34,056 --> 00:56:34,423
DISCUSSED YET. 

2014
00:56:34,423 --> 00:56:36,593
THIS IS OCCURRING DURING THE 

2015
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:37,760
MIDDLE OF THE DAY. 

2016
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,995
THE INDIVIDUAL THAT MADE THIS 

2017
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:40,597
DECISION MADE THIS DECISION TO 

2018
00:56:40,597 --> 00:56:42,098
DO THIS DURING THE MIDDLE OF 

2019
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:42,565
THE DAY. 

2020
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,400
IT IS PART OF THE IMPACT, PART 

2021
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,301
OF THE RESPONSE. 

2022
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:47,337
THEY DIDN'T DO THIS AT 

2023
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:47,704
SOMEONE'S HOME. 

2024
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:49,639
THIS GUY DID THIS FOR A REASON, 

2025
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,140
AND HE DID IT AT THAT TIME OF 

2026
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:52,375
DAY FOR A SPECIFIC REASON. 

2027
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:55,445
THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT 

2028
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:56,746
THAT. 

2029
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,147
>> IN A VISIBLE PLACE WITH 

2030
00:56:58,147 --> 00:56:59,449
PEOPLE CLOSELY WORKING 

2031
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:00,850
TOGETHER. 

2032
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:01,884
>> AND MAXIMUM IMPACT. 

2033
00:57:01,884 --> 00:57:03,719
TO HAVE NETWORKS AS LARGE AS 

2034
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:05,421
CBS THAT IS GOING COVER IT. 

2035
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:06,489
YOU BROUGHT THIS UP BEFORE AND 

2036
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:08,291
I MEANT TO SAY THIS BEFORE, 

2037
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:09,893
VERY ASTUTELY YOU BROUGHT THIS 

2038
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:12,728
UP, THE IDEA ABOUT COPYCATS. 

2039
00:57:12,728 --> 00:57:13,162
ATTENTION SEEKING. 

2040
00:57:13,162 --> 00:57:15,465
PEOPLE THAT ARE NORMAL 

2041
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:17,867
SHOOTERS, FROM A BEHAVIORAL 

2042
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,569
SIDE, THE PEDIGREE, THEY SEEK 

2043
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:19,869
ATTENTION. 

2044
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:20,870
THEY WANT TO BE HEARD. 

2045
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,338
THIS GUY IS DOING THIS, AND WE 

2046
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:24,140
DON'T KNOW THIS YET, I 

2047
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:24,540
UNDERSTAND THIS. 

2048
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,442
BUT I'M WILLING TO BET AS WE 

2049
00:57:26,442 --> 00:57:30,246
LOOK AT THIS TOMORROW MORNING 

2050
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:32,248
OR TOMORROW EVENING, THIS 

2051
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:33,549
INDIVIDUAL DID THIS, AND ONE OF 

2052
00:57:33,549 --> 00:57:34,884
THE REASONS WAS TO BE HEARD. 

2053
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:36,819
TO GET A MESSAGE ACROSS. 

2054
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:38,388
SO PEOPLE WOULD HEAR WHAT HE 

2055
00:57:38,388 --> 00:57:39,589
HAD TO SAY THAT DIDN'T HEAR 

2056
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:42,625
WHAT HE HAD TO SAY BEFORE THAT 

2057
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:42,892
 

2058
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:44,593
OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN 

2059
00:57:44,593 --> 00:57:45,962
WORKPLACES, AND WE'VE SEEN IT 

2060
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,263
IN SCHOOLS AND I THINK WE ARE 

2061
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,065
GOING TO SEE IT HERE AGAIN 

2062
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:49,465
TODAY. 

2063
00:57:49,465 --> 00:57:51,167
MID OF THE DAY. 

2064
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:51,667
LIVE SHOOTING. 

2065
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:52,301
SHOTGUN, FOUR DEAD. 

2066
00:57:52,301 --> 00:57:55,838
FOR THE RECORD, THAT IS A MASS 

2067
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:56,239
SHOOTING. 

2068
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,142
>> WHAT IS THE THRESHOLD, BASED 

2069
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,343
ON YOUR EXPERTISE? 

2070
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:01,944
>> WHENEVER YOU SEE MORE THAN 

2071
00:58:01,944 --> 00:58:03,446
THREE PEOPLE THAT ARE SHOT AND 

2072
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,548
KILLED, THAT IS A MASS 

2073
00:58:05,548 --> 00:58:06,049
SHOOTING. 

2074
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:07,750
AND AGAIN, WE GO BACK TO THE 

2075
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,352
POINT YOU RAISED BEFORE THAT 

2076
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:11,587
YOU SHARED THAT A SHOTGUN IS 

2077
00:58:11,587 --> 00:58:12,388
BEING USED. 

2078
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:13,589
THAT IS INTENTIONAL. 

2079
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:15,291
REMEMBER, NOT JUST ONE PERSON 

2080
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:16,326
IS GETTING SHOT WITH THE 

2081
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:17,393
PULLING OF THAT TRIGGER, 

2082
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:19,495
SEVERAL PEOPLE ARE GETTING 

2083
00:58:19,495 --> 00:58:19,862
SHOT. 

2084
00:58:19,862 --> 00:58:21,064
WE WE HAVE FOUR PEOPLE DEAD, 

2085
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:23,632
THAT IS A MASS SHOOTING. 

2086
00:58:23,632 --> 00:58:26,169
MORE INJURED, MORE PEOPLE BEING 

2087
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:26,669
AIRLIFTED. 

2088
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:28,103
WE STILL DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW 

2089
00:58:28,103 --> 00:58:29,839
MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HURT. 

2090
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,441
BUT WE DO KNOW THIS WAS CLEARLY 

2091
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:31,841
PLANNED OUT. 

2092
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:34,344
>> AND THE FACT THAT THIS WAS A 

2093
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,645
SHOTGUN, THAT RAISES QUESTIONS, 

2094
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:37,447
NOW ABOUT THE SECURITY OF THE 

2095
00:58:37,447 --> 00:58:37,714
BUILDING. 

2096
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:38,948
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HIDE A 

2097
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:39,215
SHOTGUN. 

2098
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:42,051
YOU HAVE TO BRING IT IN, IN A 

2099
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:42,552
LARGE BAG. 

2100
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:44,887
>> LOOK, IT IS 90 DEGREES OUT. 

2101
00:58:44,887 --> 00:58:46,589
YOU CAN'T WEAR A COAT WALKING 

2102
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:47,022
IN TODAY. 

2103
00:58:47,022 --> 00:58:48,691
HOW DID THIS PERSON COME UP TO 

2104
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:48,991
THE CAMPUS. 

2105
00:58:48,991 --> 00:58:50,626
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE CAMPUS. 

2106
00:58:50,626 --> 00:58:53,362
WHEN WE LOOK AT A SUBURBAN 

2107
00:58:53,362 --> 00:58:54,797
CAMPUS LIKE THIS WE ARE NOT 

2108
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:56,099
TALKING ABOUT MIDTOWN 

2109
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:56,399
MANHATTAN. 

2110
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:57,500
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME 

2111
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,202
DISTANCE BEFORE YOU WALK UP TO 

2112
00:58:59,202 --> 00:58:59,569
THAT BUILDING. 

2113
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:01,337
HOW ARE YOU APPROACHING THAT 

2114
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:03,139
BUILDING WHEN IT IS 90 DEGREES 

2115
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:05,942
OUT AND WITH A SHOTGUN AND NO 

2116
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:06,442
ONE SEES YOU? 

2117
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:09,145
IS THERE ANY OUTER PERIMETER 

2118
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:09,545
SECURITY? 

2119
00:59:09,545 --> 00:59:11,547
ARE THERE CAMERAS THAT INSIDE 

2120
00:59:11,547 --> 00:59:12,548
SECURITY SHOULD BE SAYING WAIT 

2121
00:59:12,548 --> 00:59:14,350
A SECOND, WE HAVE A GUY WALKING 

2122
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:15,351
UP TO THE BUILDING WITH A 

2123
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:15,618
SHOTGUN. 

2124
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:17,587
I WANT TO KNOW HOW HE GOT IN 

2125
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:17,920
THE BUILDING. 

2126
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,589
FAIR ENOUGH I DON'T ALL 

2127
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:20,956
QUESTIONS I'M SURE LAW 

2128
00:59:20,956 --> 00:59:21,590
ENFORCEMENT ARE EXPLORING RIGHT 

2129
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:21,991
NOW. 

2130
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:22,958
>> YOU CAN BET ON IT. 

2131
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:25,094
>>> I WANT TO BRING BACK THE 

2132
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:27,997
INFORMATION WE HAVE GOTTEN FROM 

2133
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:28,831
TWITTER, FROM PEOPLE IN THE 

2134
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:32,802
ROOM AS THIS WAS UNFOLDING. 

2135
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,403
IT PAINTS A TERRIFYING SCENE. 

2136
00:59:34,403 --> 00:59:36,973
ONE REPORTER FROM THIS PAPER 

2137
00:59:36,973 --> 00:59:38,307
SAYS GUNMAN SHOT THROUGH THE 

2138
00:59:38,307 --> 00:59:39,842
GLASS DOOR TO THE OFFICE AND 

2139
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:42,144
OPENED FIRE ON MULTIPLE 

2140
00:59:42,144 --> 00:59:42,444
EMPLOYEES. 

2141
00:59:42,444 --> 00:59:44,647
LATER HE TWEETED A SINGLE 

2142
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:46,349
SHOOTER SHOT MULTIPLE PEOPLE AT 

2143
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:48,051
MY OFFICE, SOME OF WHOM ARE 

2144
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:48,251
DEAD. 

2145
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,086
HE SAID I WILL TWEET WHAT I 

2146
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:53,790
CAN, WHILE I WAIT TO BE 

2147
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:54,924
INTERVIEWED BY POLICE. 

2148
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,793
PLEASE WALK US THROUGH IF YOU 

2149
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:57,894
CAN, PAUL, WHAT POLICE ARE 

2150
00:59:57,894 --> 01:00:00,396
DOING NOW IN TERMS OF GATHERING 

2151
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:01,197
INFORMATION FROM THE WITNESSES 

2152
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:03,800
WHAT KIND OF MANPOWER DOES THAT 

2153
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,167
REQUIRE. 

2154
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:05,568
>>> THERE ARE PROBABLY DOZENS 

2155
01:00:05,568 --> 01:00:07,203
OF PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE SEEN 

2156
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:08,071
SOMETHING, AND THEY ALSO HAVE 

2157
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,439
TO BE QUESTIONING THE SHOOTER 

2158
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:12,307
OR THE SUSPECT SHOOTER HIMSELF. 

2159
01:00:12,307 --> 01:00:12,775
>> RIGHT. 

2160
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,343
SO, LET'S START FROM THE 

2161
01:00:14,343 --> 01:00:15,277
GENESIS OF THAT. 

2162
01:00:15,277 --> 01:00:16,546
WHEN THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE 

2163
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:18,080
BEING BROUGHT TO A SAFE AREA 

2164
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,449
WHERE THEY CAN BE INTERVIEWED, 

2165
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,250
THEY ARE GOING TO FIRST BE 

2166
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,086
PLACED IN AN AREA AND GOING TO 

2167
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:26,489
TRY TO MAKE SURE THEY REMAIN 

2168
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:27,490
CALM AND SOME IN SOME TYPE OF 

2169
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:28,357
ENVIRONMENT THAT IS CALMING, 

2170
01:00:28,357 --> 01:00:29,692
THAT IS NOT STRESSFUL. 

2171
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:30,793
YOU STILL HAVE TO REMEMBER, 

2172
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,961
THAT IS GOING TO BE A SECURED 

2173
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:33,162
AREA. 

2174
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:34,097
POLICE STILL HAVE TO LOOK AT 

2175
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:35,498
THIS FROM THE SENSE THAT THEY 

2176
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:37,433
CAN'T RULE OUT THE FACT THAT 

2177
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:38,801
SOMEBODY INSIDE THAT BUILDING, 

2178
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,770
RIGHT NOW, DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT 

2179
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:41,838
THIS PREEMPTIVELY AND WASN'T 

2180
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:42,105
INVOLVED. 

2181
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:45,341
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO RULE THAT 

2182
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:46,042
OUT, YET. 

2183
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:49,746
THEN THEY'LL START INTERVIEWING 

2184
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:50,913
PEOPLE ORDER OF DIRECTLY 

2185
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:52,681
INVOLVED AS OPPOSED TO PEOPLE 

2186
01:00:52,681 --> 01:00:54,050
MAYBE OUTSIDE ON THE PERIMETER 

2187
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,051
AND COLLATERAL PEOPLE AND THAT 

2188
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:56,686
IS THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY 

2189
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:58,287
WOULD INTERVIEW THEM. 

2190
01:00:58,287 --> 01:00:59,989
THEY'LL INTERVIEW THEM 

2191
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:01,891
INDIVIDUALLY, AND THEN THEY MAY 

2192
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:02,424
INTERVIEW THEM TOGETHER. 

2193
01:01:02,424 --> 01:01:04,594
BUT THAT IS THE PROCESS OF HOW 

2194
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:04,861
THIS IS. 

2195
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:06,562
AND I CAN TELL YOU, THIS IS 

2196
01:01:06,562 --> 01:01:08,097
GOING TO GO ON YOU KNOW, 

2197
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:09,398
THROUGH THE NIGHT AND INTO 

2198
01:01:09,398 --> 01:01:11,601
TOMORROW AND OVER THE NEXT 

2199
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:11,934
SEVERAL DAYS. 

2200
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:12,802
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. 

2201
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:15,037
>> AND A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE 

2202
01:01:15,037 --> 01:01:17,473
BEING INTERVIEWED ARE SHAKEN, 

2203
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:18,040
TRAUMATIZE. 

2204
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:18,574
>> OF COURSE. 

2205
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:18,808
RIGHT. 

2206
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:19,942
>> WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE? 

2207
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:21,844
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE 

2208
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:23,346
ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO REALLY 

2209
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,381
RECALL WHAT HAPPENED AND TELL 

2210
01:01:25,381 --> 01:01:28,351
THEIR STORY IF MANY OF THEM ARE 

2211
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,385
IN A STATE OF SHOCK. 

2212
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:30,987
>> THAT IS SUCH A GOOD 

2213
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:31,254
QUESTION. 

2214
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:32,789
MY RESPONSE TO PEOPLE WHEN I'M 

2215
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:34,123
INTERVIEWING PEOPLE IS TO CALM 

2216
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:35,558
THEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. 

2217
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:36,993
ASK THEM IF THEY ARE OKAY. 

2218
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:39,361
DO THEY NEED ANYTHING. 

2219
01:01:39,361 --> 01:01:40,997
CONTRARY TO MOVIES, YOU DON'T 

2220
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:42,097
GIVE THEM COFFEE. 

2221
01:01:42,097 --> 01:01:44,766
THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS TO 

2222
01:01:44,766 --> 01:01:46,903
BE MORE JACKED UP THAN THEY 

2223
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:47,236
ALREADY ARE. 

2224
01:01:47,236 --> 01:01:48,971
YOU GET THEM A GLASS OF WATER 

2225
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:50,740
AND ASK WHAT THEY NEED. 

2226
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,275
ARE THEY PHONE CALLS THEY NEED 

2227
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:52,642
TO MAKE. 

2228
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:55,444
YOU TRY TO CALM THEM DOWN, 

2229
01:01:55,444 --> 01:01:56,445
BRING THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE DOWN 

2230
01:01:56,445 --> 01:01:57,546
A LITTLE BIT MORE. 

2231
01:01:57,546 --> 01:01:59,248
SO THAT THE TUNNEL VISION, 

2232
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:01,150
REMEMBER THE TUNNEL VISION, WE 

2233
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:03,018
NEED TO TAKE THEM OUT OF. 

2234
01:02:03,018 --> 01:02:03,786
THEIR HEART RATE SLOWS DOWN AND 

2235
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:05,888
THEY CAN BE A BETTER PERSON TO 

2236
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:06,188
INTERVIEW. 

2237
01:02:06,188 --> 01:02:07,390
ONCE YOU GET THEM TO THAT 

2238
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,991
POINT, THAT IS WHEN YOU CAN 

2239
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:11,093
ACTUALLY START THE INTERVIEW 

2240
01:02:11,093 --> 01:02:12,695
ONE-ON-ONE, BY ASKING THEM WHAT 

2241
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:16,799
THEIR KNOWLEDGE WAS, WHAT THEY 

2242
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,066
SAW, HEARD, SMELLED. 

2243
01:02:18,066 --> 01:02:20,102
RIGHT UP TO WHEN YOU CAME IN 

2244
01:02:20,102 --> 01:02:21,270
THIS MORNING UP TO THE POINT 

2245
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:21,703
THAT HAPPENED. 

2246
01:02:21,703 --> 01:02:23,705
>> AND HOW DO POLICE ORGANIZE 

2247
01:02:23,705 --> 01:02:24,006
THEMSELVES? 

2248
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:27,143
I MEAN, WE HAVE ANNAPOLIS 

2249
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:28,578
POLICE, COUNTY POLICE, FEDERAL 

2250
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:29,178
OFFICERS THERE. 

2251
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:29,478
>> RIGHT. 

2252
01:02:29,478 --> 01:02:31,447
>> WHO TAKES THE LEAD? 

2253
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:32,648
HOW IS THAT DETERMINED? 

2254
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:34,550
>> IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION, 

2255
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:37,954
THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT, 

2256
01:02:37,954 --> 01:02:41,891
BECAUSE THERE IS NO THERE IS 

2257
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,292
NOTHING TO ASCERTAIN AT THIS 

2258
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:45,194
POINT THAT THIS IS TERRORISM. 

2259
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:48,197
SO IT IS GOING TO BE THE LOCAL 

2260
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:49,398
AGENCY AND I DON'T KNOW WHO 

2261
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:49,932
THAT IS. 

2262
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,600
THE LOCAL AGENCY, IF THEY CAN 

2263
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,569
HANDLE IT, WILL HANDLE IT, AT 

2264
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:54,036
THIS POINT. 

2265
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:55,338
IF THEY NEED ASSISTANCE, THEN 

2266
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:59,041
THEY WOULD BRING IN MAYBE ATF, 

2267
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,043
FBI, WHOEVER ELSE, WHATEVER 

2268
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:03,546
OTHER AGENCIES FEDERAL AGENCIES 

2269
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:07,650
THAT COULD ASSIST IN THE 

2270
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:08,017
INVESTIGATION. 

2271
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:09,051
BUT PRIMARILY THAT COMMAND 

2272
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:10,987
CENTER IS GOING TO BE RUN BY 

2273
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:12,021
THE LOCAL AGENCY. 

2274
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:14,390
>>> WE HAVE JUST LEARNED FROM 

2275
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:15,458
CBS NEWS LAW ENFORCEMENT 

2276
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:16,692
SOURCES, THAT THE SUSPECT IS 

2277
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:18,394
REFUSING TO IDENTIFY HIMSELF. 

2278
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:20,196
WE KNOW HE IS WHITE, MALE, IN 

2279
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:22,799
HIS 20s AND THAT HE HAS NO ID 

2280
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:23,032
ON HIM. 

2281
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:24,800
>>> WE WANT TO RECAP WHAT WE 

2282
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,367
HAVE LEARNED. 

2283
01:03:25,367 --> 01:03:27,670
THERE IS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 

2284
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:27,970
SITUATION. 

2285
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,772
POLICE DO SAY THEY HAVE ONE 

2286
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:31,139
PERSON IN CUSTODY. 

2287
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:34,443
THIS IS A WHITE MALE IN HIS 

2288
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:34,643
20s. 

2289
01:03:34,643 --> 01:03:35,945
WHO IS REFUSING TO IDENTIFY 

2290
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:36,846
HIMSELF. 

2291
01:03:36,846 --> 01:03:38,547
THIS IS IN ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND 

2292
01:03:38,547 --> 01:03:41,851
AT THE CAPITOL GAZETTE 

2293
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:42,918
NEWSPAPER BUILDING. 

2294
01:03:42,918 --> 01:03:44,787
THIS IS AT A NEWSPAPER 

2295
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:45,120
ORGANIZATION. 

2296
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:47,089
AND WE GOT REPORTS DIRECTLY 

2297
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:48,591
FROM REPORTERS IN THAT NEWSROOM 

2298
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:51,394
OR IN THAT ROOM WHERE THIS 

2299
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:52,561
UNFOLDED, VIA TWITTER, WHO 

2300
01:03:52,561 --> 01:03:54,096
TALKED ABOUT WHAT WAS 

2301
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:54,797
HAPPENING. 

2302
01:03:54,797 --> 01:03:55,431
WHAT THEY WERE SEEING. 

2303
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:58,000
WE HAVE ONE REPORTER WHO SAID 

2304
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,001
GUNMAN SHOT THROUGH THE GLASS 

2305
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,870
DOOR TO THE OFFICE AND OPENED 

2306
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:04,373
FIRE ON MULTIPLE EMPLOYEES. 

2307
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:05,241
CBS NEWS HAS LEARNED FOUR 

2308
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:08,644
PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THIS 

2309
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:08,911
INCIDENT. 

2310
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:09,545
LAW ENFORCEMENT SAYS THEY ARE 

2311
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:11,447
STILL TRYING TO CLEAR THE 

2312
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:11,714
BUILDING. 

2313
01:04:11,714 --> 01:04:13,082
THEY HAVE SECURED THE AREA, 

2314
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:14,283
DESIGNATED A PLACE FOR ANYONE 

2315
01:04:14,283 --> 01:04:15,785
WHO HAS A LOVED ONE WHO WORKS 

2316
01:04:15,785 --> 01:04:21,290
IN THE BUILDING TO REUNITE WITH 

2317
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:21,991
HIM. 

2318
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:23,893
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE FEAR PEOPLE 

2319
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:25,594
MAY HAVE WHO MAY KNOW SOMEONE 

2320
01:04:25,594 --> 01:04:27,096
WHO WORKS IN THAT BUILDING AND 

2321
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:29,598
THAT HIS TO RUSH TO THAT 

2322
01:04:29,598 --> 01:04:31,600
LOCATION TO BE REUNITED WITH 

2323
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:31,800
THEM. 

2324
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,270
WE HAVE NO INFORMATION ON WHO 

2325
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:34,870
THE DECEASED ARE. 

2326
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:37,373
IT IS STILL VERY EARLY IN THE 

2327
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:38,040
PROCESS. 

2328
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:42,445
BUT WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM 

2329
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:42,845
LAW ENFORCEMENT. 

2330
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:45,046
THEY SAID THERE ARE INJURIES, 

2331
01:04:45,046 --> 01:04:46,482
BUT THEY WOULDN'T SPECIFY HOW 

2332
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:48,451
MANY, THEY WOULDN'T SPEAK ABOUT 

2333
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:52,688
ANYBODY WHO WAS POSSIBLY 

2334
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:52,921
KILLED. 

2335
01:04:52,921 --> 01:04:53,889
THEY DID ACKNOWLEDGE THEY HAD 

2336
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:56,292
THE SHOOTER IN CUSTODY AND THAT 

2337
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:59,295
THEY BELIEVED THERE WAS ONLY 

2338
01:04:59,295 --> 01:04:59,662
ONE SUSPECT. 

2339
01:04:59,662 --> 01:05:10,038
I WANT TO BRING IN PAUL. 

2340
01:05:10,038 --> 01:05:11,706
>> IT SEEMS LIKE IN SO MANY OF 

2341
01:05:11,706 --> 01:05:14,643
THESE CASES IT IS A SINGLE 

2342
01:05:14,643 --> 01:05:16,378
SHOOTER, A YOUNG PERSON. 

2343
01:05:16,378 --> 01:05:16,678
>> RIGHT. 

2344
01:05:16,678 --> 01:05:18,180
>> WHAT DOES THAT TELL BUT 

2345
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:18,480
RESOURCES. 

2346
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,348
>>> WHAT MIGHT BE LEADING 

2347
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:20,949
PEOPLE TO DO THIS AND ACT 

2348
01:05:20,949 --> 01:05:21,450
ALONE? 

2349
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,085
>> WELL THE INTERESTING PART OF 

2350
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:24,019
THIS IS, AGAIN, WE ARE SEEING 

2351
01:05:24,019 --> 01:05:25,087
SOMEBODY IN THEIR 20s. 

2352
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:38,300
BUT IT IS A WORKPLACE.

2353
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:40,703
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY ID AND HE 

2354
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:41,836
WON'T IDENTIFY HIMSELF. 

2355
01:05:41,836 --> 01:05:44,339
WHAT DOES THAT TELL US? 

2356
01:05:44,339 --> 01:05:45,875
THEY HAVEN'T TOLD US ANYTHING 

2357
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:47,076
ABOUT HIS PEDIGREE, OTHER THAN 

2358
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:49,979
WHITE MALE IN HIS 20s. 

2359
01:05:49,979 --> 01:05:52,548
IT BEGS THE QUESTION, WHY IS AN 

2360
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:54,283
INDIVIDUAL IN THEIR 20s COMING 

2361
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:55,351
TO A WORKPLACE. 

2362
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:57,052
LET'S SAY HE DIDN'T WORK AT. 

2363
01:05:57,052 --> 01:05:59,288
WHY IS HE COMING THERE WITH SO 

2364
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:01,390
MUCH DISDAIN HE IS WALKING UP 

2365
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:02,157
WITH A SHOTGUN. 

2366
01:06:02,157 --> 01:06:03,793
>>> THAT TELLS ME CLEARLY THERE 

2367
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,795
IS SOME TYPE OF PERSONAL 

2368
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:11,834
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT 

2369
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:19,808
INDIVIDUAL AND SOMEONE OR 

2370
01:06:19,808 --> 01:06:23,579
MULTIPLE PEOPLE IN THE 

2371
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:23,846
BUILDING. 

2372
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:25,147
IT COME DOWN WHAT IS THE LEVEL 

2373
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,582
OF MOTIVATION AND CLEARLY THAT 

2374
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:28,050
TELLS ME THIS IS SOMEBODY THAT 

2375
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:29,051
MADE A DECISION WAY BEFORE 

2376
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:32,988
TODAY THAT SELECTED THIS 

2377
01:06:32,988 --> 01:06:33,622
WEAPON, INTENTIONALLY TO COME 

2378
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:41,897
THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. 

2379
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:42,097
WHY? 

2380
01:06:42,097 --> 01:06:42,464
MAXIMUM IMPACT. 

2381
01:06:42,464 --> 01:06:45,201
THIS IS NOT SURPRISING ME ABOUT 

2382
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:45,601
THE AGE. 

2383
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:47,670
BECAUSE WE KNOW RIGHT NOW WELL 

2384
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:53,876
OVER 60% OF SHOOTERS TODAY ARE 

2385
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:55,611
BETWEEN 22 AND 31. 

2386
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:56,846
THAT SKEW IS COMING OVER THE 

2387
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,881
LAST FIVE YEARS WITH A LOT 

2388
01:06:58,881 --> 01:06:59,281
YOUNGER SHOOTERS. 

2389
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:02,952
>> WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? 

2390
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,787
>> WELL IT SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT 

2391
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:06,388
WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH HERE 

2392
01:07:06,388 --> 01:07:07,790
IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH 

2393
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:09,191
RESPECT TO THE USE OF FIREARMS 

2394
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:10,793
AND THE MANNER IN WHICH 

2395
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:12,595
CONFLICT IS BEING RESOLVED AND 

2396
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:14,997
HOW BOTH OF THOSE ARE MARRYING 

2397
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:17,199
TOGETHER INSIDE THE WORKPLACE 

2398
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,334
AND INSIDE SCHOOLS, INSIDE 

2399
01:07:19,334 --> 01:07:19,601
CHURCHES. 

2400
01:07:19,601 --> 01:07:21,871
I MEAN, HOW MANY TIMES DO WE 

2401
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:22,771
KEEP COVERING THIS? 

2402
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:25,374
AND IT IS ALMOST EVERY THREE 

2403
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:25,741
WEEKS, RIGHT? 

2404
01:07:25,741 --> 01:07:28,077
IT TELLS ME THAT WE HAVE A 

2405
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:29,578
SIGNIFICANT EPIDEMIC, IN THIS 

2406
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:31,847
COUNTRY, AS IT RELATES TO A 

2407
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:34,483
LACK OF RESOLVING CONFLICT IN A 

2408
01:07:34,483 --> 01:07:35,851
PRODUCTIVE WAY AND WE ARE USING 

2409
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:37,620
FIREARMS TO DO IT AND THE 

2410
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,688
YOUNGER THEY ARE, THE MORE THEY 

2411
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:41,490
ARE REVERTING TO THIS TYPE OF 

2412
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:41,790
ACTION. 

2413
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:44,994
>> IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE, I HAVE 

2414
01:07:44,994 --> 01:07:47,396
COVERED PROBABLY FIVE SCHOOL 

2415
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:48,863
SHOOTINGS SINCE JANUARY. 

2416
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:50,165
IT IS SHOCKING. 

2417
01:07:50,165 --> 01:07:51,600
HOW OFTEN THEY HAPPEN, HOW 

2418
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,135
SIMILAR THEY ARE TO EACH OTHER. 

2419
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:56,372
THIS IS IN A WORKPLACE. 

2420
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:59,275
THE FACT THIS SUSPECT ISN'T 

2421
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:00,075
IDENTIFYING HIMSELF, IS THAT 

2422
01:08:00,075 --> 01:08:02,778
WHAT POINTS YOU TO THE FACT 

2423
01:08:02,778 --> 01:08:04,280
THIS MIGHT BE DOMESTICALLY 

2424
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:04,547
TIED? 

2425
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:04,780
>> YES. 

2426
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,982
>> AND NOT A WORK GRIEVANCE 

2427
01:08:06,982 --> 01:08:08,684
THAT SOMEBODY WANTS TO BRING 

2428
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:09,818
NOTORIETY TO HIMSELF? 

2429
01:08:09,818 --> 01:08:11,987
>> THAT IS WHAT THAT'S TELLING 

2430
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:12,187
ME. 

2431
01:08:12,187 --> 01:08:13,355
THE REASON WHY SOMEBODY 

2432
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:13,989
WOULDN'T CARRY IDENTIFICATION 

2433
01:08:13,989 --> 01:08:15,591
AND DOESN'T WANT TO BE KNOWN, 

2434
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:17,225
ALMOST MAKES ME FEEL THAT THAT 

2435
01:08:17,225 --> 01:08:18,093
PERSON DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE 

2436
01:08:18,093 --> 01:08:19,795
GOING TO LEAVE THE BUILDING. 

2437
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:21,697
>> THAT THEY WOULD TAKE THEIR 

2438
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:21,997
OWN LIFE? 

2439
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:24,466
>> THAT IS EXACTLY CORRECT. 

2440
01:08:24,466 --> 01:08:27,469
A LOT HAS TO DO WITH HOW WAS 

2441
01:08:27,469 --> 01:08:28,236
THIS GUY CAPTURED? 

2442
01:08:28,236 --> 01:08:31,073
WE JUST KNOW THEY IDENTIFIED 

2443
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:31,740
THE SHOOTER. 

2444
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,843
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE 

2445
01:08:34,843 --> 01:08:36,178
SURRENDERED, AND WE NEED TO 

2446
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:36,645
KNOW THAT. 

2447
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:39,782
BECAUSE THAT IS GOING TO TELL 

2448
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,216
US A WHOLE LOT MORE ABOUT WHY 

2449
01:08:41,216 --> 01:08:44,185
HE CAME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 

2450
01:08:44,185 --> 01:08:46,188
DAY, AT THIS PARTICULAR 

2451
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:47,055
LOCATION, WITHOUT 

2452
01:08:47,055 --> 01:08:49,491
IDENTIFICATION AND REFUSING TO 

2453
01:08:49,491 --> 01:08:49,957
IDENTIFY HIMSELF. 

2454
01:08:49,957 --> 01:08:51,527
>> WE DON'T KNOW IF EMPLOYEES 

2455
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:53,095
IN THAT ROOM TACKLED HIM. 

2456
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:55,698
WE HAVE SEEN THAT HAPPEN IN THE 

2457
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:56,599
CASE. 

2458
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:58,901
I BELIEVE A DENNY'S THERE WAS A 

2459
01:08:58,901 --> 01:08:59,801
SHOOTING. 

2460
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:01,770
AND HE WAS TACKLED BY THOSE 

2461
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:02,002
NEARBY. 

2462
01:09:02,002 --> 01:09:05,073
>>> YOU ARE ABLE TO CREATE THIS 

2463
01:09:05,073 --> 01:09:07,977
PATTERN TO LOOK FOR THINGS THAT 

2464
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,078
WILL INDICATE WHETHER THIS 

2465
01:09:10,078 --> 01:09:12,581
MIGHT BE DOMESTICALLY TIED, BUT 

2466
01:09:12,581 --> 01:09:14,283
DOMESTIC SHOOTINGS HAPPEN MORE 

2467
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:14,883
OFTEN THAN PEOPLE GUNGE THERE 

2468
01:09:14,883 --> 01:09:20,022
IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. 

2469
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:21,090
WITH OVER 560 WORKPLACE 

2470
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:22,791
VIOLENCE SHOOTINGS HAPPENING 

2471
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,993
EVERY YEAR, THINK ABOUT THE 

2472
01:09:24,993 --> 01:09:27,595
FREQUENCY OF THAT WHEN WE TALK 

2473
01:09:27,595 --> 01:09:29,296
ABOUT THE IMPROBABILITY OF 

2474
01:09:29,296 --> 01:09:29,598
RISK. 

2475
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:29,997
ARE I HAVE BEEN. 

2476
01:09:29,997 --> 01:09:32,533
SO YOU KNOW, IT IS NOT THAT WE 

2477
01:09:32,533 --> 01:09:33,102
DON'T HAVE EPIDEMIC PRO 

2478
01:09:33,102 --> 01:09:34,336
PORTIONS OF SHOOTINGS IN THIS 

2479
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:34,603
COUNTRY. 

2480
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:35,871
THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT 

2481
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,171
THAT. 

2482
01:09:36,171 --> 01:09:37,372
BUT YOU DO RAISE A GREAT POINT 

2483
01:09:37,372 --> 01:09:40,175
WITH RESPECT TO THE AGE OF THE 

2484
01:09:40,175 --> 01:09:40,576
SHOOTER. 

2485
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:41,577
THE AGES GOING DOWN. 

2486
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:43,178
AND WE REALLY NEED TO START 

2487
01:09:43,178 --> 01:09:43,779
EXAMINING THAT. 

2488
01:09:43,779 --> 01:09:45,381
BUT I REALLY THINK, COMING BACK 

2489
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:46,881
TO WHAT WE STARTED TALKING 

2490
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:48,050
ABOUT BEFORE, WHEN WE ANALYZE, 

2491
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:49,651
AND WE ARE NOT FAR FROM THIS. 

2492
01:09:49,651 --> 01:09:52,488
WE ARE GOING TO KNOW, PRETTY 

2493
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:53,354
SOON, WHERE THIS SHOOTING 

2494
01:09:53,354 --> 01:09:55,256
OCCURRED IN THAT BUILDING. 

2495
01:09:55,256 --> 01:09:57,126
AS YOU POINTED OUT, THERE WERE 

2496
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:58,193
MULTIPLE OFFICES AND COMPANIES 

2497
01:09:58,193 --> 01:09:59,060
IN THAT BUILDING. 

2498
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:00,061
WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE IT 

2499
01:10:00,061 --> 01:10:01,597
OCCURRED, AND THAT IS GOING TO 

2500
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:03,799
TELL US AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT WHY 

2501
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:04,166
IT OCCURRED. 

2502
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:06,001
>> THE WITNESSES THAT POLICE 

2503
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:09,171
ARE INTERVIEWING, RIGHT NOW. 

2504
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:11,139
ARE THEY GOING TO BE RELEASED 

2505
01:10:11,139 --> 01:10:13,308
OR HELD FOR FURTHER 

2506
01:10:13,308 --> 01:10:13,642
QUESTIONING? 

2507
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:15,210
>> POSSIBLY, COULD BE BOTH. 

2508
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:17,179
REALLY DON'T KNOW. 

2509
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:19,214
I MEAN, POLICE WILL HOLD 

2510
01:10:19,214 --> 01:10:19,814
SOMEBODY IF THEY TRULY FEEL 

2511
01:10:19,814 --> 01:10:21,884
THAT PERSON IS NOT BEING 

2512
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:22,184
FORTHRIGHT. 

2513
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:22,885
IF THEY ARE LYING DURING THE 

2514
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:24,620
COURSE OF THAT INTERVIEW. 

2515
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,055
WHEN YOU ARE INTERVIEWING 

2516
01:10:27,055 --> 01:10:28,924
SOMEBODY, IF THEY ARE GIVING 

2517
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:30,658
YOU MULTIPLE STORIES, ADAMANTLY 

2518
01:10:30,658 --> 01:10:31,794
PROCLAIMING ONE AND THE NEXT 

2519
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:32,995
THING YOU KNOW, THEY ARE GIVING 

2520
01:10:32,995 --> 01:10:34,396
YOU A COMPLETE OPPOSITE STORY, 

2521
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:34,997
YOU KNOW WHAT? 

2522
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:36,198
I CAN TELL YOU, POLICE ARE 

2523
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:38,701
GOING TO HOLD THAT PERSON FOR 

2524
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:39,001
AWHILE. 

2525
01:10:39,001 --> 01:10:40,135
IT COULD BE EITHER. 

2526
01:10:40,135 --> 01:10:41,603
>>> LOOKING FOR CONSISTENCY? 

2527
01:10:41,603 --> 01:10:44,639
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. 

2528
01:10:44,639 --> 01:10:46,975
>>> PAUL, WE JUST GOT QUOTES 

2529
01:10:46,975 --> 01:10:48,243
FROM A REPORTER WHO WAS IN THE 

2530
01:10:48,243 --> 01:10:49,644
ROOM AS THIS HAPPENED. 

2531
01:10:49,644 --> 01:10:51,380
WE ARE ALSO SEEING PICTURES OF 

2532
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:51,980
POLICE. 

2533
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:53,582
THEY ARE GETTING READY TO 

2534
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:54,082
ADDRESS REPORTERS. 

2535
01:10:54,082 --> 01:10:55,784
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN CUT TO THAT 

2536
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:58,420
RIGHT NOW TO GET AN UPDATE. 

2537
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,623
>> THIS IS A VERY ACTIVE AND 

2538
01:11:01,623 --> 01:11:02,123
ONGOING INVESTIGATION. 

2539
01:11:02,123 --> 01:11:03,392
WE ARE STILL TRYING TO MAKE 

2540
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,127
SURE EVERYONE IS SAFE, REUNITE 

2541
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:06,194
PEOPLE WITH THEIR FAMILIES. 

2542
01:11:06,194 --> 01:11:07,496
AND ONCE THE BUILDING IS SECURE 

2543
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:09,598
WE HAVE A CRIME SCENE, 

2544
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:10,065
OBVIOUSLY. 

2545
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:11,833
SO WE ANTICIPATE THIS BEING A 

2546
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:13,802
VERY LONG INVESTIGATION, VERY 

2547
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:14,870
DETAILED INVESTIGATION BY 

2548
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:15,170
DETECTIVES. 

2549
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:22,411
I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE FIRST 

2550
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:24,279
OUR COUNTY EXECUTIVE STEVEN 

2551
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:24,680
SHUE. 

2552
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,513
WE ARE GOING TO LIMIT QUESTIONS 

2553
01:11:25,513 --> 01:11:27,583
AT THIS TIME JUST FOR 

2554
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:28,083
INVESTIGATIVE PURPOSES. 

2555
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,719
WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO 

2556
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:30,886
DO. 

2557
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:32,020
THANK YOU. 

2558
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:37,692
>>> THANK YOU, OFFICER. 

2559
01:11:37,692 --> 01:11:39,161
I'M COUNTY EXECUTIVE STEVE 

2560
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:39,361
SHOE. 

2561
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:41,830
WE HAVE HAD A TERRIBLE INCIDENT 

2562
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:42,297
THIS AFTERNOON. 

2563
01:11:42,297 --> 01:11:43,399
THERE ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO 

2564
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:44,800
HAVE DIED FROM THIS INCIDENT, 

2565
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,968
AND SEVERAL OTHERS ARE INJURED. 

2566
01:11:46,968 --> 01:11:50,072
THOSE WHO ARE INJURED HAVE BEEN 

2567
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:57,379
TRANSPORTED FOR MEDICAL CARE TO 

2568
01:11:57,379 --> 01:12:00,515
ANN ARUNEDDAL MEDICAL CENTER. 

2569
01:12:00,515 --> 01:12:05,187
THOSE FATALITIES ARE SO SAD. 

2570
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:06,087
OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE 

2571
01:12:06,087 --> 01:12:08,656
WITH THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. 

2572
01:12:08,656 --> 01:12:09,324
WE TAKE COMFORT KNOWING THEY 

2573
01:12:09,324 --> 01:12:11,359
ARE IN GOD'S EMBRACE. 

2574
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:13,261
THE SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY. 

2575
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:15,730
I WANT TO COMMEND THE PUBLIC 

2576
01:12:15,730 --> 01:12:16,532
SAFETY PROFESSIONALS WHO WERE 

2577
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:18,901
VERY QUICK TO THE SCENE HERE, 

2578
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:19,902
WITHIN ABOUT 60 SECONDS. 

2579
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:22,371
AND WE HAVE HAD A TREMENDOUS 

2580
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:23,372

01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:26,875
ANNAPOLIS CITY POLICE AND FIRE, 

2583
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:29,678
BUT ALSO STATE POLICE, HOWARD 

2584
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:30,879
COUNTY, PRINCE GEORGE'S,

SEVERAL FEDERAL AGENCIES, 

2586
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,682
INCLUDING FBI AND ATF. 

2587
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,384
I WANT TO THANK ALL THOSE 

2588
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:36,885
AGENCIES FOR THEIR QUICK 

2589
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:38,420
RESPONSE AND BEING OUR PARTNERS 

2590
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:40,689
IN THIS VERY UNFORTUNATE 

2591
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:40,956
INCIDENT. 

2592
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:43,225
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK GOVERNOR 

2593
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:45,160
HOGAN TO SAY A FEW WORDS. 

2594
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,396
>>> I JUST WANT TO SAY FIRST OF 

2595
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:48,630
ALL, OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS 

2596
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:51,700
ARE WITH THE VICTIMS AND THEIR 

2597
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:52,401
FAMILIES. 

2598
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:55,070
AND I WANT TO THANK THE LAW 

2599
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:58,574
ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS WHO 

2600
01:12:58,574 --> 01:12:58,874
RESPONDED. 

2601
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,876
OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM DID 

2602
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:01,476
AN INCREDIBLE JOB. 

2603
01:13:01,476 --> 01:13:02,778
THEY ARE STILL DOING IT NOW. 

2604
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:04,680
BUT THE FACT THEY RESPONDED 

2605
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,782
WITHIN 60 SECONDS, I WANT TO 

2606
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:08,584
GIVE SERIOUS PRAISE TO THE 

2607
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:11,119
COUNTY AND THE CITY OF 

2608
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:12,286
ANNAPOLIS FOR THEIR RESPONSE. 

2609
01:13:12,286 --> 01:13:13,722
WE WERE HERE WITH THE STATE 

2610
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:15,790
AGENCIES TO BACK THEM UP. 

2611
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:17,058
WE HAVE FEDERAL AGENCIES. 

2612
01:13:17,058 --> 01:13:19,027
IT IS A TRAGIC SITUATION. 

2613
01:13:19,027 --> 01:13:20,329
WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE 

2614
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:21,663
INFORMATION YET, AND WE CAN'T 

2615
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,031
GIVE ALL THE INFORMATION YET, 

2616
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:24,700
BECAUSE IT IS AN ACTIVE CRIME 

2617
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,302
SCENE AND AN INVESTIGATION. 

2618
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:28,670
BUT WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL 

2619
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:29,404
FATALITIES AND SEVERAL PEOPLE 

2620
01:13:29,404 --> 01:13:31,974
THAT ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 

2621
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:33,976
AND WE'LL JUST LEAVE IT TO THE 

2622
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:39,881
PROFESSIONALS TO CONTINUE THEIR 

2623
01:13:39,881 --> 01:13:40,449
ONGOING INVESTIGATION. 

2624
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:41,283
>> Reporter: CAN YOU TALK ABOUT 

2625
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:44,319
THE NUMBER OF FATALITIES? 

2626
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:44,686
MORE THAN TWO? 

2627
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:45,954
CAN YOU TELL US AT LEAST ANY 

2628
01:13:45,954 --> 01:13:47,155
KIND OF NUMBERS NOW? 

2629
01:13:47,155 --> 01:13:49,324
>> I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS 

2630
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:52,594
OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE OUR 

2631
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:53,028
ACTING CHIEF. 

2632
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:54,429
HE WILL ANSWER QUESTIONS. 

2633
01:13:54,429 --> 01:13:56,231
BUT AGAIN, PLEASE, IT WILL BE 

2634
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:56,631
VERY BRIEF. 

2635
01:13:56,631 --> 01:13:58,100
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE 

2636
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,968
INFORMATION PUT OUT IS 

2637
01:13:59,968 --> 01:14:00,802
ACCURATE. 

2638
01:14:00,802 --> 01:14:01,670
YOU KNOW, THERE IS A LOT OF 

2639
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:02,470
PEOPLE INVOLVED HERE. 

2640
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:04,273
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE 

2641
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,574
INFORMATION IS ACCURATE AND WE 

2642
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:06,808
DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING THAT 

2643
01:14:06,808 --> 01:14:08,744
WILL RUIN THE INVESTIGATION. 

2644
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:13,582
THE SUSPECT IS STILL BEING 

2645
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:20,522
INTERVIEWED BY DETECTIVES. 

2646
01:14:20,522 --> 01:14:21,689
ACTING CHIEF WILLIAM CRENSHAW. 

2647
01:14:21,689 --> 01:14:23,125
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, YOU CAN SEE 

2648
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:26,228
WE HAVE OVER 10 PLUS AGENCIES 

2649
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:26,595
ASSISTING. 

2650
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:28,730
THE INVESTIGATION HAS JUST 

2651
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:28,997
STARTED. 

2652
01:14:28,997 --> 01:14:30,198
SO AS BRIAN HAS SAID, WE ARE 

2653
01:14:30,198 --> 01:14:32,801
GOING TO BE QUITE AWHILE 

2654
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:33,802
DETERMINING WHAT OCCURRED, WHY 

2655
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:35,971
IT OCCURRED AND HOW IT 

2656
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:36,471
OCCURRED. 

2657
01:14:36,471 --> 01:14:38,106
BUT AS THE GOVERNOR MENTIONED, 

2658
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:40,175
WE WERE HERE QUICKLY, WE CAME 

2659
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:42,343
INTO THE BUILDING VERY QUICKLY. 

2660
01:14:42,343 --> 01:14:44,980
WE RECEIVED A CALL AS AN ACTIVE 

2661
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:45,480
SHOOTER. 

2662
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,683
WE DO HAVE FATALITIES AND WE DO 

2663
01:14:47,683 --> 01:14:48,750
HAVE SERIOUS INJURIES. 

2664
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:50,919
WE ALSO HAVE MANY, MANY 

2665
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:53,622
WITNESSES THAT ARE BEING 

2666
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:56,191
INTERVIEWED, AND WE HAVE AN 

2667
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:58,694
AREA, OVER BY LORD & TAYLOR 

2668
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:01,229
THAT THE WITNESSES CAN REUNITE 

2669
01:15:01,229 --> 01:15:01,763
WITH THEIR FAMILIES. 

2670
01:15:01,763 --> 01:15:03,732
WE ARE ASKING THEM TO CONTACT 

2671
01:15:03,732 --> 01:15:05,200
THEIR FAMILIES, SO THAT THEY 

2672
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:08,370
CAN COME AND ASSIST THEM WITH 

2673
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:09,604
GETTING HOME SAFELY. 

2674
01:15:09,604 --> 01:15:11,974
AS RYAN MENTIONED BEFORE, OUR 

2675
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:12,708
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION 

2676
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:14,642
HAS ONE PERSON IN CUSTODY. 

2677
01:15:14,642 --> 01:15:16,378
THAT PERSON IS AT OUR CRIMINAL 

2678
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:18,981
INVESTIGATION DIVISION DOWN IN 

2679
01:15:18,981 --> 01:15:21,917
CROWNSVILLE, AND WE WILL BE 

2680
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:22,684
SPEAKING WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL 

2681
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:24,319
QUITE FREAKILY, AND WELL 

2682
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:28,824
SHORTLY, I SHOULD SAY, AND GET 

2683
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:29,257
THE INFORMATION. 

2684
01:15:29,257 --> 01:15:33,028
THE BUILDING IS SECURE -F A 

2685
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:33,495
TACTICAL STANDPOINT. 

2686
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:35,030
THAT MEANS RIGHT NOW, WE 

2687
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:36,131
BELIEVE, THERE ARE NO OTHER 

2688
01:15:36,131 --> 01:15:38,199
SHOOTERS IN THE BUILDING. 

2689
01:15:38,199 --> 01:15:40,602
BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN CLEARED 

2690
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:43,171
FROM AN INVESTIGATIVE 

2691
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:43,672
STANDPOINT. 

2692
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:44,673
SO ONCE THE MEMBERS OF THE 

2693
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:44,940
S.W.A.T. 

2694
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:47,175
TEAM LEAVE THE BUILDING, THE 

2695
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:48,577
INVESTIGATORS WILL GO IN, AND 

2696
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:54,749
THEN WE WILL START TO PROCESS 

2697
01:15:54,749 --> 01:15:57,719
PUTTING THE INVESTIGATION 

2698
01:15:57,719 --> 01:15:58,053
TOGETHER. 

2699
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:00,722
>> RIGHT NOW WE CAN'T CONFIRM 

2700
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:04,226
EXACTLY WHERE THE SHOOTING 

2701
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:04,493
OCCURRED. 

2702
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:06,961
THE CAPITAL GAZETTE IS INSIDE 

2703
01:16:06,961 --> 01:16:07,328
THAT BUILDING. 

2704
01:16:07,328 --> 01:16:08,530
>> Reporter: DO YOU HAVE ANY 

2705
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,999
NUMBERS ON CASUALTIES? 

2706
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:12,100
>> NOT AT THIS POINT. 

2707
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,702
>> Reporter: DID YOUR OFFICE 

2708
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:14,569
INTERRUPT THE SHOOTING? 

2709
01:16:14,569 --> 01:16:16,271
>> OUR OFFICERS WERE ON THE 

2710
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:17,605
SCENE VERY, VERY QUICKLY. 

2711
01:16:17,605 --> 01:16:20,275
I THINK IT WAS A MINUTE, MINUTE 

2712
01:16:20,275 --> 01:16:21,376
AND A HALF. 

2713
01:16:21,376 --> 01:16:22,477
AND THEY DID ENGAGE THE SUSPECT 

2714
01:16:22,477 --> 01:16:24,279
AND THAT IS WHEN HE WAS TAKEN 

2715
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:24,646
INTO CUSTODY. 

2716
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:30,218
IT OCCURRED VERY QUICKLY. 

2717
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:31,520
FOR EVERYBODY, THAT IS OUR 

2718
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,221
ACTING CHIEF AND I WOULD LIKE 

2719
01:16:33,221 --> 01:16:38,427
TO INTRODUCE THE MAYOR OF THE 

2720
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,128
CITY OF ANNAPOLIS, KEVIN 

2721
01:16:40,128 --> 01:16:40,529
BUCKLEY. 

2722
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:41,863
>>> THE CITY SENDS US LOVE AND 

2723
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:43,865
THOUGHTS FOR ALL THE FAMILIES 

2724
01:16:43,865 --> 01:16:48,704
THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS 

2725
01:16:48,704 --> 01:16:49,071
HORRIBLE EVENT. 

2726
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:51,006
I WANT TO COMMEND OUR FIRST 

2727
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:52,374
RESPONDERS FORGETTING ONTO THE 

2728
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:53,975
SCENE AS QUICKLY AS THEY DID. 

2729
01:16:53,975 --> 01:16:55,943
IF THEY WERE NOT THERE AS 

2730
01:16:55,943 --> 01:16:57,178
QUICKLY AS THEY WERE, IT COULD 

2731
01:16:57,178 --> 01:16:59,314
HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE. 

2732
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:01,483
IT WAS A GREAT JOINT EFFORT BY 

2733
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:01,783
EVERYBODY. 

2734
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,585
THIS IS WHAT WE TRAINED FOR. 

2735
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:06,421
A WEEK AGO WE PRACTICED AN 

2736
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:08,189
ACTIVE SHOOTER TRAINING. 

2737
01:17:08,189 --> 01:17:09,024
WE DID NOT EXPECT SOMETHING 

2738
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:11,192
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN IN OUR 

2739
01:17:11,192 --> 01:17:12,127
COMMUNITY, BUT WE WERE READY 

2740
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:14,329
AND I DON'T THINK WE COULD HAVE 

2741
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:16,598
PUT ANY MORE RESOURCES. 

2742
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:18,700
IT IS A TREMENDOUS RESPONSE. 

2743
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,035
>> Reporter: HOW MANY PEOPLE 

2744
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:20,768
HAVE BEEN KILLED? 

2745
01:17:20,768 --> 01:17:22,771
>> WE CAN'T CONFIRM THAT YET. 

2746
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:24,706
I'LL LEAVE THAT ABOUT THE 

2747
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:24,939
COUNTY. 

2748
01:17:24,939 --> 01:17:35,784
SO I'LL HAND IT BACK TO YOU. 

2749
01:17:35,784 --> 01:17:38,720
>> AT THIS POINT,BER STILL 

2750
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,489
REUNITING PEOPLE WITH FAMILIES, 

2751
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:43,225
AND WE ARE INTERVIEWING THIS 

2752
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:50,132
SUSPECT, WE DON'T WANT TO PUT 

2753
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,332
THAT INFORMATION OUT. 

2754
01:17:51,332 --> 01:17:52,434
>> Reporter: YOU ARE NOT 

2755
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:53,502
LOOKING FOR ANYONE ELSE? 

2756
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:56,571
>> AT THIS POINT HE IS THE ONLY 

2757
01:17:56,571 --> 01:17:56,771
ONE. 

2758
01:17:56,771 --> 01:18:08,216
I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE 

2759
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:08,984
STATE'S ATTORNEY MR. WESLEY 

2760
01:18:08,984 --> 01:18:09,584
ABBOTT. 

2761
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:11,219
>> THIS IS AN ACTIVE 

2762
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:12,053
INVESTIGATION, WE'LL WORK IN 

2763
01:18:12,053 --> 01:18:13,922
CONJUNCTION WITH THE DETECTIVES 

2764
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:15,123
AND THE POLICE OFFICERS 

2765
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:19,427
HANDLING THE SCENE TO MAKE SURE 

2766
01:18:19,427 --> 01:18:20,929
WE HAVE EVERYTHING CORRECTLY. 

2767
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:22,430
THAT IS THE ONLY COMMENT MY 

2768
01:18:22,430 --> 01:18:23,531
OFFICE CAN MAKE AT THIS TIME, 

2769
01:18:23,531 --> 01:18:25,200
BUT WE ARE ON SCENE ASSISTING 

2770
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,301
WITH ALL THE OTHER LAW 

2771
01:18:27,301 --> 01:18:28,103
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. 

2772
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:29,104
>> Reporter: YOU GUYS HAVE ANY 

2773
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:30,872
TYPE OF MOTIVE RIGHT NOW? 

2774
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:32,307
>> THE INVESTIGATION IS STILL 

2775
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:33,942
ACTIVE AND ONGOING. 

2776
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:35,377
MY OFFICE, IN PARTICULAR, 

2777
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,879
CANNOT COMMENT IN ANY WAY ON 

2778
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:38,145
EVIDENCE. 

2779
01:18:38,145 --> 01:18:39,481
>> Reporter: WHAT TYPE OF 

2780
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:40,482
WEAPON WAS USED? 

2781
01:18:40,482 --> 01:18:47,823
>> TURN THAT BACK OVER TO 

2782
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:49,925
LIEUTENANT FRAZIER SURE. 

2783
01:18:49,925 --> 01:18:51,225
>> WE ANTICIPATE HAVING ANOTHER 

2784
01:18:51,225 --> 01:18:52,427
BRIEFING VERY SHORTLY TO TRY TO 

2785
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:54,829
GET THAT INFORMATION OUT. 

2786
01:18:54,829 --> 01:18:58,433
AT THIS POINT WITH IT BEING A 

2787
01:18:58,433 --> 01:19:00,202
VERY ACTIVE INVESTIGATION. 

2788
01:19:00,202 --> 01:19:02,204
WE IMMEDIATE TO MAKE SURE WE 

2789
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:03,805
HAVE ACCURATE INFORMATION. 

2790
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:05,106
WE ANTICIPATE ANOTHER UPDATE 

2791
01:19:05,106 --> 01:19:08,877
HERE VERY SHORTLY. 

2792
01:19:09,477 --> 01:19:09,610
. 

2793
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:10,578
>> AT THIS POINT WE ARE STILL 

2794
01:19:10,578 --> 01:19:13,882
TALKING TO THE INDIVIDUAL, 

2795
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:15,083
ENGAGING THE INDIVIDUAL AND 

2796
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:16,384
TRYING TO FIND OUT ALL THE 

2797
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:20,722
THINGS THAT COME ALONG WITH 

2798
01:19:20,722 --> 01:19:21,423
THESE INVESTIGATIONS. 

2799
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:22,057
IT TAKES A LONG TIME. 

2800
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:23,825
>> Reporter: GOVERNOR HOGAN, 

2801
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:26,628
NOT SO LONG AGO WE GATHERED 

2802
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:28,096
SIMILARLY IN SOUTHERN MARYLAND. 

2803
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:29,731
A SHOOTING, LIKE THIS. 

2804
01:19:29,731 --> 01:19:30,765
WHAT ARE YOUR SHOTS? 

2805
01:19:30,765 --> 01:19:33,535
WHAT IS IN YOUR HEART THIS 

2806
01:19:33,535 --> 01:19:34,803
AFTERNOON AS THE LEADER OF OUR 

2807
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:35,136
STATE? 

2808
01:19:35,136 --> 01:19:36,471
>> WELL THE FIRST THING YOUR 

2809
01:19:36,471 --> 01:19:38,206
HEART GOES OUT TO ALL THE 

2810
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:40,275
PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES AND 

2811
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:41,209
PEOPLE AFFECTED HERE. 

2812
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:43,611
IT IS JUST A TRAGIC SITUATION. 

2813
01:19:43,611 --> 01:19:46,181
THEY ARE TWO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT 

2814
01:19:46,181 --> 01:19:46,481
SITUATIONS. 

2815
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:48,183
BUT IN SOUTHERN MARYLAND WE HAD 

2816
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:49,884
A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER THAT 

2817
01:19:49,884 --> 01:19:51,853
ACTED IMMEDIATELY AND SAVED 

2818
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:53,421
LIVES AND NEAR HERE IN 60 

2819
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:55,523
SECONDS WE HAD THE POLICE 

2820
01:19:55,523 --> 01:19:56,725
RESPONSE. 

2821
01:19:56,725 --> 01:19:57,525
WHILE BOTH ARE TRAGIC, OUR 

2822
01:19:57,525 --> 01:19:59,727
RESPONSE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. 

2823
01:19:59,727 --> 01:20:01,930
I WANT TO PRAISE THE LOCAL 

2824
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:03,732
OFFICIALS WHO PERHAPS SAVED 

2825
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:04,933
LIVES BY GETTING THIS WHILE THE 

2826
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,434
THING WAS TAKING PLACE AND 

2827
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:08,303
APPREHENDING THE SUSPECT. 

2828
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:09,905
AND HE IS IN CUSTODY. 

2829
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:11,506
I KNOW IT IS FRUSTRATING. 

2830
01:20:11,506 --> 01:20:13,909
IT IS NOT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE 

2831
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:15,210
INFORMATION, THEY JUST CAN'T 

2832
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:16,144
SHARE THE INFORMATION. 

2833
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:17,279
THEY KNOW THE NUMBER OF 

2834
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:18,880
FATALITIES, THEY KNOW THE 

2835
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:19,281
WEAPON. 

2836
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:21,583
BUT THIS IS ACTIVELY GOING ON 

2837
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:23,385
AND IT CAN HINDER THE 

2838
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:23,752
INVESTIGATION. 

2839
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:24,819
I BELIEVE WHEN THEY HAVE THE 

2840
01:20:24,819 --> 01:20:26,755
NEXT BRIEFING THEY WILL PROVIDE 

2841
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:27,122
YOU WITH MORE. 

2842
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:28,023
>> Reporter: DO YOU THINK IT IS 

2843
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:30,458
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE RECENT 

2844
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:30,725
ELECTS? 

2845
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:30,959
>> NO. 

2846
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:33,261
>> Reporter: WAS THE SHOOTER 

2847
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:33,528
INJURED? 

2848
01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:35,230
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT 

2849
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:39,601
INFORMATION AND THAT WILL BE 

2850
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:41,202
TWO THINGS I'LL CHECK ON. 

2851
01:20:41,202 --> 01:20:46,808
WE ARE STILL TRYING TO 

2852
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:47,308
DETERMINE THE SUSPECT. 

2853
01:20:47,308 --> 01:20:47,909
>> Reporter: DID THE SUSPECT 

2854
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:50,211
EXCHANGE GUNFIRE WITH THE 

2855
01:20:50,211 --> 01:20:50,444
POLICE? 

2856
01:20:50,444 --> 01:20:51,513
>> THAT WILL BE MORE 

2857
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:53,481
INFORMATION FOR THE NEXT 

2858
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:53,748
BRIEFING. 

2859
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:55,317
>> Reporter: CAN YOU CONFIRM HE 

2860
01:20:55,317 --> 01:20:56,784
USED A SHOTGUN? 

2861
01:20:56,784 --> 01:20:58,453
>> I CANNOT. 

2862
01:20:58,453 --> 01:20:59,754
AGAIN, WE HAVE SEVERAL 

2863
01:20:59,754 --> 01:21:01,122
QUESTIONS WE KNOW WE NEED 

2864
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:03,190
ANSWERS FOR THE NEXT BRIEFING. 

2865
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:04,826
WE ANTICIPATE HAVING TO BRIEF 

2866
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:06,127
YOU WITHIN ANOTHER HOUR. 

2867
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:07,729
AT THIS TIME THAT IS ALL THE 

2868
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:10,131
INFORMATION WE HAVE. 

2869
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:11,298
WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. 

2870
01:21:11,298 --> 01:21:14,436
>>> WE HAVE ONE MORE BIT OF 

2871
01:21:14,436 --> 01:21:14,769
INFORMATION. 

2872
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:17,405
THAT IS THE LAST UNTIL THE NEXT 

2873
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:17,672
BRIEFING. 

2874
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:19,107
I ANTICIPATE ANOTHER BRIEFING 

2875
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:19,840
VERY, VERY SHORTLY. 

2876
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,077
THERE ARE FIVE FATALITIES WE 

2877
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:23,377
KNOW OF. 

2878
01:21:23,377 --> 01:21:24,779
THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER PERSONS 

2879
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:26,147
THAT ARE GRAVELY INJURED. 

2880
01:21:26,147 --> 01:21:26,981
WE WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION 

2881
01:21:26,981 --> 01:21:38,592
FOR YOU IN THE NEXT BRIEFING. 

2882
01:21:38,592 --> 01:21:38,893
THANK YOU. 

2883
01:21:38,893 --> 01:21:40,128
>> THAT WAS THE SECOND NEWS 

2884
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:42,830
BRIEFING WE GOT FROM LAW 

2885
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:44,532
ENFORCEMENT, IN ADDITION TO THE 

2886
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:46,034
GOVERNOR, THE MAYOR, AS WELL AS 

2887
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:46,967
OTHER MEMBERS OF LAW 

2888
01:21:46,967 --> 01:21:48,769
ENFORCEMENT RESPONDING TO THE 

2889
01:21:48,769 --> 01:21:49,003
SCENE. 

2890
01:21:49,003 --> 01:21:50,705
WE HAVE NOW LEARNED -F THAT 

2891
01:21:50,705 --> 01:21:51,539
NEWS BRIEFING THAT FIVE PEOPLE 

2892
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:55,210
HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THIS 

2893
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:55,477
INCIDENT. 

2894
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:56,978
THAT IS UP FROM FOUR. 

2895
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:57,879
FIVE PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR 

2896
01:21:57,879 --> 01:22:00,147
LIVES IN THIS SHOOTING. 

2897
01:22:00,147 --> 01:22:02,784
WE KNOW THAT CBS NEWS HAS 

2898
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:06,121
LEARNED A SHOTGUN WAS USED IN 

2899
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:07,422
THIS SHOOTING. 

2900
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:08,089
POLICE WOULDN'T CONFIRM THAT. 

2901
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:09,524
THEY DID TELL US IN THIS 

2902
01:22:09,524 --> 01:22:12,427
BRIEFING THAT OFFICERS ENGAGED 

2903
01:22:12,427 --> 01:22:12,893
THE SUSPECT. 

2904
01:22:12,893 --> 01:22:15,230
LET'S BRING IN HOMELAND 

2905
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,131
SECURITY CORRESPONDENT, JEFF, 

2906
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:17,532
YOU WERE LISTENING INTO THAT. 

2907
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:19,234
WHAT STRUCK YOU FROM THAT 

2908
01:22:19,234 --> 01:22:19,534
CONFERENCE? 

2909
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:20,735
>> WELL THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT 

2910
01:22:20,735 --> 01:22:27,242
OF INFORMATION THAT THEY WANT 

2911
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:32,681
TO GIVE OUT. 

2912
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:35,416
HE USED A SHOTGUN IN THIS 

2913
01:22:35,416 --> 01:22:36,217
SHOOTING. 

2914
01:22:36,217 --> 01:22:36,918
HE SURRENDERED WITHOUT 

2915
01:22:36,918 --> 01:22:37,218
INCIDENT. 

2916
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:38,620
WHAT IS ALSO INTERESTING IS 

2917
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:40,622
THAT WHILE THEY ARE TRYING TO 

2918
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:42,524
ENGAGE HIM OUR CBS NEWS SOURCES 

2919
01:22:42,524 --> 01:22:44,025
ARE TELLING US HE IS NOT 

2920
01:22:44,025 --> 01:22:46,261
COOPERATING, IN THAT HE IS NOT 

2921
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:46,761
REVEALING HIS IDENTITY. 

2922
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:49,331
WHEN HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY, 

2923
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:50,231
HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY FORM OF 

2924
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:50,731
IDENTIFICATION ON HIM. 

2925
01:22:50,731 --> 01:22:51,966
I THINK THAT IS INTERESTING, 

2926
01:22:51,966 --> 01:22:52,333
TOO. 

2927
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:53,735
I HAVE COVERED A LOT OF THESE 

2928
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:55,036
TYPES OF INCIDENTS, AND THIS IS 

2929
01:22:55,036 --> 01:22:56,805
THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAVE 

2930
01:22:56,805 --> 01:23:00,108
HEARD OF A SUSPECT NOT 

2931
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:00,575
IDENTIFYING HIMSELF. 

2932
01:23:00,575 --> 01:23:02,110
FRANKLY, IT IS NOT GOING TO 

2933
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:03,711
TAKE LONG FOR INVESTIGATORS TO 

2934
01:23:03,711 --> 01:23:06,080
FIGURE OUT WHO THIS PERSON IS. 

2935
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,116
SO I FOUND THAT INTERESTING AND 

2936
01:23:08,116 --> 01:23:08,917
PERHAPS SOMETHING THAT 

2937
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:09,984
INVESTIGATORS WILL TALK ABOUT 

2938
01:23:09,984 --> 01:23:12,020
MORE WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR NEXT 

2939
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:14,823
BRIEFING, WHICH, AS INDICATED, 

2940
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:17,826
COULD COME WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR 

2941
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:18,093
OR SO. 

2942
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:20,328
BUT THIS IS STILL ONE OF THOSE 

2943
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:22,530
SITUATIONS WHERE THEY ARE NOT 

2944
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:23,932
REREELING THE MOTIVE JUST YET. 

2945
01:23:23,932 --> 01:23:25,233
IT IS TOO EARLY FOR THAT. 

2946
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:27,735
A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO 

2947
01:23:27,735 --> 01:23:30,505
HAVE THE QUESTION WHY DID THIS 

2948
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:30,872
HAPPEN? 

2949
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:31,973
WHY WAS THE CAPITAL GAZETTE 

2950
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:34,509
TARGETED IN THIS WAY. 

2951
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:35,610
THOSE ARE QUESTIONS 

2952
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:36,311
INVESTIGATORS WILL OBVIOUSLY 

2953
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:38,179
TRY TO ANSWER BY QUESTIONING 

2954
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:40,981
AND ENGAGING THIS SUSPECT. 

2955
01:23:40,981 --> 01:23:42,083
BUT WHETHER HE COOPERATES WITH 

2956
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:44,719
THEM FULLY BY REVEALING HIS 

2957
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,621
MOTIVE, WE JUST DON'T KNOW YET. 

2958
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:47,622
>>> YES, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

2959
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:49,023
WE KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT MORE 

2960
01:23:49,023 --> 01:23:50,124
DIGGING TO DO ON THIS. 

2961
01:23:50,124 --> 01:23:52,393
WE ARE GOING TO LET YOU GO. 

2962
01:23:52,393 --> 01:23:53,628
JUST TO RECAP WHAT WE HAVE 

2963
01:23:53,628 --> 01:23:55,029
LEARNED FROM THIS NEWS 

2964
01:23:55,029 --> 01:23:56,231
CONFERENCE FROM POLICE AND FROM 

2965
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:58,533
THE MAYOR AND THE GOVERNOR OF 

2966
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:02,303
MARYLAND WAS THERE AS WELL, 

2967
01:24:02,303 --> 01:24:03,370
THEY HAVE CONFIRMED THERE ARE 

2968
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:06,473
FIVE PEOPLE THAT ARE DEAD IN 

2969
01:24:06,473 --> 01:24:07,609
THIS SHOOTING. 

2970
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:08,375
AT THE CAPITOL GAZETTE. 

2971
01:24:08,375 --> 01:24:11,312
THIS HAPPENED IN ANNAPOLIS, 

2972
01:24:11,312 --> 01:24:11,813
MARYLAND. 

2973
01:24:11,813 --> 01:24:12,614
WE ALSO LEARNED THAT POLICE 

2974
01:24:12,614 --> 01:24:14,715
WERE AT THE SCENE IN 60 SECONDS 

2975
01:24:14,715 --> 01:24:18,353
AND THAT THEY WERE THE ONES WHO 

2976
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:20,021
ENGAGED IN SHOOTER AND -- THIS 

2977
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:23,258
SHOOTER AND TOOK THIS SHOOTER 

2978
01:24:23,258 --> 01:24:23,591
INTO CUSTODY. 

2979
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:24,726
PAUL, WHEN WE WERE WATCHING 

2980
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:27,028
THIS, AND THEY SAID THAT IT WAS 

2981
01:24:27,028 --> 01:24:28,830
60 SECONDS BETWEEN THE TIME 

2982
01:24:28,830 --> 01:24:30,131
THAT THIS INCIDENT STARTED AND 

2983
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:32,133
POLICE GOT THERE, WHAT DID THAT 

2984
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:33,067
SAY TO YOU? 

2985
01:24:33,067 --> 01:24:35,869
>> THAT JUMPED OFF THE PAGE TO 

2986
01:24:35,869 --> 01:24:36,604
ME. 

2987
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:37,105
THAT SAYS SO MUCH. 

2988
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:39,707
BECAUSE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 

2989
01:24:39,707 --> 01:24:41,409
AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS NOT 

2990
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:42,243
SURROUNDED BY POLICE. 

2991
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:46,113
MINE, WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT, 

2992
01:24:46,113 --> 01:24:46,781
GOD FORBID, SOMETHING THAT 

2993
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:48,783
WOULD HAPPEN HERE AND THERE IS 

2994
01:24:48,783 --> 01:24:49,950
A PATROL CAR DRIVING BY. 

2995
01:24:49,950 --> 01:24:52,086
THIS IS A SUBURBAN ENVIRONMENT, 

2996
01:24:52,086 --> 01:24:53,620
A CAMPUS THAT DOESN'T NORMALLY 

2997
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:55,423
HAVE A POLICE PRESENCE. 

2998
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:58,726
IT BEGS THE QUESTION WHY WERE 

2999
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:00,795
POLICE SO CLOSELYBY? 

3000
01:25:00,795 --> 01:25:02,396
WHERE DID THIS WHAT HAPPENED? 

3001
01:25:02,396 --> 01:25:02,963
WHO NOTICED THIS? 

3002
01:25:02,963 --> 01:25:04,832
WAS THERE SECOND QUARTER ON THE 

3003
01:25:04,832 --> 01:25:05,065
CAMPUS? 

3004
01:25:05,065 --> 01:25:07,701
AND HOW WAS THE RESPONSE 60 

3005
01:25:07,701 --> 01:25:07,968
SECONDS? 

3006
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:09,804
I'M GLAD IT WAS AND GRATEFUL IT 

3007
01:25:09,804 --> 01:25:10,037
WAS. 

3008
01:25:10,037 --> 01:25:12,006
BUT IT RAISES A HUGE QUESTION 

3009
01:25:12,006 --> 01:25:15,910
MARK IN MY MIND AS TO HOW THAT 

3010
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:17,077
HAPPENED WITHIN 60 SECONDS. 

3011
01:25:17,077 --> 01:25:19,214
>> AND ALSO MIGHT POINT TO THE 

3012
01:25:19,214 --> 01:25:21,482
FACT THAT TRAINING HAS CHANGED. 

3013
01:25:21,482 --> 01:25:22,717
IT HAS SHORTENED THE RESPONSE 

3014
01:25:22,717 --> 01:25:24,185
TIME RIGHT NOW. 

3015
01:25:24,185 --> 01:25:27,455
BUT IT ALSO BEGS THE BE, FIVE 

3016
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:29,357
PEOPLE WERE -- THE QUESTION, 

3017
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:31,059
FIVE PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THAT 

3018
01:25:31,059 --> 01:25:31,659
TIME PERIOD. 

3019
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:31,959
>> EXACTLY. 

3020
01:25:31,959 --> 01:25:33,127
THINK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE TALKING 

3021
01:25:33,127 --> 01:25:33,360
ABOUT. 

3022
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,729
SOMEBODY IS WALKING UP TO A 

3023
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:36,531
CAMPUS, WALKING UP WITH A 

3024
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:36,898
SHOTGUN. 

3025
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:38,233
IF YOU SEE THEM WALKING UP, AND 

3026
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:40,601
THIS COULD BE WHY WE HAD 60 

3027
01:25:40,601 --> 01:25:41,803
SECONDS, MAYBE THEY HAVE AND 

3028
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:44,105
THERE IS SO MANY MAYBES AT THIS 

3029
01:25:44,105 --> 01:25:45,006
POINT, MAYBE THEY HAVE SECURITY 

3030
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:47,008
THAT ARE ON SITE, AND THEY SAW 

3031
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:49,410
THIS INDIVIDUAL WALKING UP AND 

3032
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:50,612
THEY CALLED 911, AND POLICE 

3033
01:25:50,612 --> 01:25:52,714
WERE CLOSE BY AND THEY 

3034
01:25:52,714 --> 01:25:53,014
RESPONDED. 

3035
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:54,548
SO BY THE TIME THIS PERSON GOT 

3036
01:25:54,548 --> 01:25:57,819
THEIR WAY INTO THE CAMPUS AND 

3037
01:25:57,819 --> 01:25:59,420
STARTED SHOOTING, POLICE WERE 

3038
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:00,121
THERE. 

3039
01:26:00,121 --> 01:26:01,288
GRANTED, THAT PROBABLY 

3040
01:26:01,288 --> 01:26:01,555
HAPPENED. 

3041
01:26:01,555 --> 01:26:02,123
BUT CLEARLY THERE WOULD NOT 

3042
01:26:02,123 --> 01:26:04,959
HAVE BEEN A RESPONSE TIME THIS 

3043
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:07,128
EXPEDITIOUSLY IF THEY DIDN'T 

3044
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:08,062
NOTICE THIS, UNLESS POLICE WERE 

3045
01:26:08,062 --> 01:26:10,431
SITTING IN THE PARKING LOT. 

3046
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:10,932
>> 

3047
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:11,933
>> AND AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED 

3048
01:26:11,933 --> 01:26:14,335
BEFORE TO THE FACT HE HAD A 

3049
01:26:14,335 --> 01:26:16,604
SHOTGUN AND NOT A PISTOL MAY 

3050
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:18,006
HAVE TIPPED PEOPLE OFF, MAY 

3051
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:19,273
HAVE TIPPED OFF SECURITY. 

3052
01:26:19,273 --> 01:26:20,908
I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT 

3053
01:26:20,908 --> 01:26:24,412
ABOUT WHAT WE LEARNED FROM 

3054
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:25,713
ANEWS CONFERENCE. 

3055
01:26:25,713 --> 01:26:29,017
AS YOU AND I WERE ITSING HERE 

3056
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:29,651
LISTENING, OUR EARS PERKED UP 

3057
01:26:29,651 --> 01:26:32,253
WHEN WE HEARD, THEY SAID THE 

3058
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:34,522
BUILDING IS SECURED FROM A 

3059
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:36,824
TACTICAL STANDPOINT, BUT NOT AN 

3060
01:26:36,824 --> 01:26:37,625
INVESTIGATION STANDPOINT. 

3061
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:37,925
>> RIGHT. 

3062
01:26:37,925 --> 01:26:41,161
SO THEY CLEARED THE BUILDING 

3063
01:26:41,161 --> 01:26:43,164
BUT NOT THE Z SO CLEARED THE 

3064
01:26:43,164 --> 01:26:49,203
BUILDING MEANS THEY CLEARED THE 

3065
01:26:49,203 --> 01:26:50,037
BUILDING FROM PEOPLE. 

3066
01:26:50,037 --> 01:26:51,606
SO EVERYONE IS OUT OF THE 

3067
01:26:51,606 --> 01:26:53,741
BUILDING, THE BUILDING IS 

3068
01:26:53,741 --> 01:26:54,042
CLEAR. 

3069
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,910
THERE COULDN'T BE ANOTHER 

3070
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:59,213
SHOOTER, THERE ARE NO POTENTIAL 

3071
01:26:59,213 --> 01:27:01,215
VICTIMS, NO POTENTIAL 

3072
01:27:01,215 --> 01:27:01,515
WITNESSES. 

3073
01:27:01,515 --> 01:27:02,984
BUT THE SCENE HASN'T BEEN 

3074
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:03,251
CLEARED. 

3075
01:27:03,251 --> 01:27:05,453
WHICH MEANS IN ALL PROBABILITY, 

3076
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:07,922
THERE IS MORE THAN ONE CRIME 

3077
01:27:07,922 --> 01:27:08,423
SCENE. 

3078
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:09,824
INVESTIGATORS WILL NOW COME IN 

3079
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,958
AND START PLACING NUMBERS ON 

3080
01:27:10,958 --> 01:27:13,461
THE FLOORS AS TO WHERE THEY 

3081
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:15,663
SEASHELL CASINGS, WHERE THEY 

3082
01:27:15,663 --> 01:27:25,406
SEE FOOTPRINTS, BLOOD SPATTERS 

3083
01:27:25,406 --> 01:27:26,507
AND CRIME SCENE TECHS WILL HAVE 

3084
01:27:26,507 --> 01:27:29,010
TO ANALYZE HOW MANY CRIME 

3085
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:30,111
SCENES THEY HAVE. 

3086
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:31,112
WHEN THEY HAVE SAID THEY HAVE 

3087
01:27:31,112 --> 01:27:32,814
CLEARED THE BUILDING BUT NOT 

3088
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:33,915
THE CRIME SCENE, THAT IS WHAT 

3089
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:36,484
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT. 

3090
01:27:36,484 --> 01:27:37,851
>> THOSE THAT EVIDENCE MARKERS? 

3091
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:39,419
>> THAT IS EXACTLY CORRECT. 

3092
01:27:39,419 --> 01:27:41,155
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE 

3093
01:27:41,155 --> 01:27:41,623
GOING TO DO. 

3094
01:27:41,623 --> 01:27:44,158
START FROM THE GROUND AND GO 

3095
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:44,324
UP. 

3096
01:27:44,324 --> 01:27:45,426
WHAT THAT TELLS US IS THERE IS 

3097
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:46,627
PROBABLY MORE THAN ONE CRIME 

3098
01:27:46,627 --> 01:27:48,029
SCENE AND THAT IS HOW THEY ARE 

3099
01:27:48,029 --> 01:27:49,530
GOING TO PROCESS THAT. 

3100
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:51,132
>> WHY DOES IT INDICATE IT IS 

3101
01:27:51,132 --> 01:27:53,767
MORE THAN ONE CRIME SCENE? 

3102
01:27:53,767 --> 01:27:55,036
>> WHEN THEY SAID THEY CLEARED 

3103
01:27:55,036 --> 01:27:57,305
THE BUILDING BUT NOT THE SCENE, 

3104
01:27:57,305 --> 01:28:00,508
THAT TELLS ME THERE WAS 

3105
01:28:00,508 --> 01:28:01,242
MULTIPLE SCENES. 

3106
01:28:01,242 --> 01:28:02,110
THE INDIVIDUAL PROBABLY FIRED 

3107
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:03,711
HIS WAY IN, AND DISCHARGED 

3108
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:05,813
OTHER ROUNDS IN DIFFERENT PARTS 

3109
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:06,347
OF THE BILGED. 

3110
01:28:06,347 --> 01:28:07,014
WHEREVER THAT OCCURRED, THAT IS 

3111
01:28:07,014 --> 01:28:10,017
GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT CRIME 

3112
01:28:10,017 --> 01:28:13,020
SCENE, DIFFERENT BLOOD SPATTER, 

3113
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:16,124
BROKEN GLASS AND A VARIETY OF 

3114
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:17,558
TRACE EVIDENCE THAT WILL BE 

3115
01:28:17,558 --> 01:28:18,826
COLLECTED IN ALL THOSE 

3116
01:28:18,826 --> 01:28:19,860
DIFFERENT PLACES. 

3117
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:22,230
THEY HAVE TO TREAT THEM AS 

3118
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:23,898
DIFFERENT CRIME SCENES. 

3119
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:26,567
REMEMBER ONCE THEY DEKYLE DYER 

3120
01:28:26,567 --> 01:28:27,835
IT IS CLEAR, THERE IS GOING TO 

3121
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:30,571
BE A UNIFORM OFFICER PLACED ON 

3122
01:28:30,571 --> 01:28:32,106
THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING AND 

3123
01:28:32,106 --> 01:28:34,809
THEY WILL HAVE A LOG AND 

3124
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:35,176
CONTROL ACCESS. 

3125
01:28:35,176 --> 01:28:36,911
SO UNLESS YOU HAVE A NEED TO BE 

3126
01:28:36,911 --> 01:28:38,112
IN THE BUILDING NO ONE IS GOING 

3127
01:28:38,112 --> 01:28:40,781
TO WALK IN THE BUILDING. 

3128
01:28:40,781 --> 01:28:42,617
BECAUSE WE SAW THE STATE 

3129
01:28:42,617 --> 01:28:44,218
ATTORNEY GOT INTRODUCED. 

3130
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:45,753
THAT WAS NOT BY ACCIDENT. 

3131
01:28:45,753 --> 01:28:46,420
STATE ATTORNEY GOT INTRODUCED 

3132
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:47,355
BECAUSE THEY ARE STARTING TO 

3133
01:28:47,355 --> 01:28:48,823
BUILD A CRIMINAL CASE RIGHT 

3134
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:49,023
NOW. 

3135
01:28:49,023 --> 01:28:50,224
THEY BROUGHT THE STATE ATTORNEY 

3136
01:28:50,224 --> 01:28:51,959
IN, AT THAT TIME, LIKE WE WOULD 

3137
01:28:51,959 --> 01:28:56,731
HERE IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK 

3138
01:28:56,731 --> 01:28:58,365
WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S 

3139
01:28:58,365 --> 01:29:01,035
OFFICE TO MAKE SURE AS WE 

3140
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:02,737
COLLECT EVIDENCE EVERYTHING IS 

3141
01:29:02,737 --> 01:29:05,306
DONE SYSTEMATICALLY SO NOTHING 

3142
01:29:05,306 --> 01:29:05,940
CAN FALL BETWEEN THE CRACKS. 

3143
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:07,808
>> WHAT ROLE WILL THE FACT HE 

3144
01:29:07,808 --> 01:29:10,711
BROUGHT IN A SHOTGUN, NOT A 

3145
01:29:10,711 --> 01:29:12,413
PISTOL, WILL THAT PLAY IN THE 

3146
01:29:12,413 --> 01:29:14,115
CRIMINAL CASE BUILT AGAINST 

3147
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:14,315
HIM? 

3148
01:29:14,315 --> 01:29:18,252
>> IT IS GOING TO COME DOWN TO 

3149
01:29:18,252 --> 01:29:18,953
INTENT. 

3150
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:20,455
HE IS DOING BLOCKING, NOT SO 

3151
01:29:20,455 --> 01:29:21,021
MUCH TACKLING. 

3152
01:29:21,021 --> 01:29:22,557
HE IS NOT GOING TO IDENTIFY 

3153
01:29:22,557 --> 01:29:22,824
HIMSELF. 

3154
01:29:22,824 --> 01:29:24,625
THEY ARE GOING TO KNOW WHO HE 

3155
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:24,791
IS. 

3156
01:29:24,791 --> 01:29:28,229
THE CHOICE OF WEAPON IS GOING 

3157
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:29,630
TO CORRELATE TO THE INTENT 

3158
01:29:29,630 --> 01:29:31,231
BEHIND THE INCIDENT HIMSELF. 

3159
01:29:31,231 --> 01:29:32,733
HE IS PROBABLY GOING TO COUGH 

3160
01:29:32,733 --> 01:29:35,669
THAT UP LATER DURING THE COURSE 

3161
01:29:35,669 --> 01:29:36,838
OF AN INTERROGATION AND IF HE 

3162
01:29:36,838 --> 01:29:39,907
DOESN'T, IT IS GOING TO BECOME 

3163
01:29:39,907 --> 01:29:40,307
PAINFULLY CLEAR. 

3164
01:29:40,307 --> 01:29:41,108
REMEMBER WHAT WE ARE DOING 

3165
01:29:41,108 --> 01:29:44,679
RIGHT NOW IS WE ARE COLLECTING 

3166
01:29:44,679 --> 01:29:53,855
A PLETHORA OF EVIDENCE, 

3167
01:29:53,855 --> 01:29:55,523
FORENSICICALLY FROM SEARCH -- 

3168
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:56,757
FORENSICALLY, WE ARE GOING TO 

3169
01:29:56,757 --> 01:29:58,359
KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW 

3170
01:29:58,359 --> 01:29:59,760
REGARDING THE INTENT OF THIS 

3171
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,062
INCIDENT, JUST FROM THAT ALONE. 

3172
01:30:02,062 --> 01:30:03,764
>>> WE HAVE JUST HEARD FROM THE 

3173
01:30:03,764 --> 01:30:04,531
PRESIDENT ON TWITTER. 

3174
01:30:04,531 --> 01:30:07,200

SHOOTING AT CAPITAL GAZETTE IN

ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND. 

3178
01:30:11,672 --> 01:30:12,540
MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE

01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:14,875

3180
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:15,142
FAMILIES.

THE SCENE. 

3184
01:30:20,447 --> 01:30:21,315

3185
01:30:21,315 --> 01:30:22,817
FIRST RESPONDERS WERE THERE 

3186
01:30:22,817 --> 01:30:27,320
WITHIN 60 SECONDS. 

3187
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:28,489
>> UNBELIEVABLE. 

3188
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:29,590
INCREDIBLE RESPONSE TIME. 

3189
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:31,191
>> WHICH HAS SAVED LIVES. 

3190
01:30:31,191 --> 01:30:33,561
WE WANT TO PAINT A PICTURE FOR 

3191
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:34,795

WE WANT TO PAINT A PICTURE FOR

01:30:42,069 --> 01:30:43,738
OUR VIEWERS WHAT IT WAS LIKE 

3196
01:30:43,738 --> 01:30:44,305
INSIDE THAT ROOM. 

3197
01:30:44,305 --> 01:30:45,506
WE HAVE TWEETS, ALSO, FROM A 

3198
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:48,242
REPORTER WHO WAS THERE. 

3199
01:30:48,242 --> 01:30:49,643
THIS REPORTER TALKED ABOUT 

3200
01:30:49,643 --> 01:30:51,012
WHATND, WHAT HE SAW. 

3201
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:53,414
HE SAID A SINGLE SHOOTER SHOT 

3202
01:30:53,414 --> 01:30:54,916
MULTIPLE PEOPLE AT MY OFFICE 

3203
01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:57,418
AND WE HAVE ALSO HEARD MORE 

3204
01:30:57,418 --> 01:30:59,253
FROM THIS REPORTER FROM A 

3205
01:30:59,253 --> 01:31:00,955
BALTIMORE SUN ARTICLE, WHERE HE 

3206
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:01,488
GAVE A QUOTE. 

3207
01:31:01,488 --> 01:31:04,559
SO THIS IS A REPORTER WHO WORKS 

3208
01:31:04,559 --> 01:31:06,127
FOR THE CAPITAL GAZETTE, WHICH 

3209
01:31:06,127 --> 01:31:09,463
IS OWNED BY THE BALTIMORE SUN. 

3210
01:31:09,463 --> 01:31:11,065
IN THIS ARTICLE, PUBLISHED BY 

3211
01:31:11,065 --> 01:31:13,034
THE BALTIMORE SUN, THIS 

3212
01:31:13,034 --> 01:31:14,535
REPORTER, WHOSE NAME IS PHIL 

3213
01:31:14,535 --> 01:31:16,804
DAVIS, A CAPITAL GAZETTE CRIME 

3214
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:18,305
REPORTER, SAID THAT IT WAS LIKE 

3215
01:31:18,305 --> 01:31:21,074
QUOTE A WAR ZONE INSIDE THE 

3216
01:31:21,074 --> 01:31:21,409
OFFICES. 

3217
01:31:21,409 --> 01:31:23,110
HE SAID IT WAS A SITUATION THAT 

3218
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:24,946
WOULD BE QUOTE HARD TO 

3219
01:31:24,946 --> 01:31:25,613
DESCRIBE, FOR AWHILE. 

3220
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:27,915
HE CONTINUED AND SAID I'M A 

3221
01:31:27,915 --> 01:31:28,315
POLICE REPORTER. 

3222
01:31:28,315 --> 01:31:31,419
I WRITE ABOUT THIS STUFF. 

3223
01:31:31,419 --> 01:31:32,653
NO, SIR NECESSARILY TO THIS 

3224
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:33,721
ACCIDENT, BUT SHOOTINGS AND 

3225
01:31:33,721 --> 01:31:34,955
DEATHS ALL THE TIME. 

3226
01:31:34,955 --> 01:31:38,593
HE SAID AS MUCH AS I'M GOING TO 

3227
01:31:38,593 --> 01:31:41,963
TRY TO ARTICULATE HOW 

3228
01:31:41,963 --> 01:31:43,965
TRAUMATIZING IT IS, TO BE 

3229
01:31:43,965 --> 01:31:46,233
HIDING UNDER YOUR DESK, YOU 

3230
01:31:46,233 --> 01:31:47,969
DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU ARE THERE 

3231
01:31:47,969 --> 01:31:49,203
AND YOU FEEL HELPLESS. 

3232
01:31:49,203 --> 01:31:51,772
>> THOSE ARE WORDS FROM SOMEONE 

3233
01:31:51,772 --> 01:31:53,407
INSIDE THE WORD, FEARING FOR 

3234
01:31:53,407 --> 01:31:54,542
THEIR LIFE, WATCHING THEIR 

3235
01:31:54,542 --> 01:31:56,010
FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES BE 

3236
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:56,343
GUNNED DOWN. 

3237
01:31:56,343 --> 01:31:59,313
ALL WE KNOW IS HE IS AIRMAIL 

3238
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:08,522
MALE IN HIS 20s AND NOT 

3239
01:32:08,522 --> 01:32:13,293
COOPERATING WITH POLICE. 

3240
01:32:13,293 --> 01:32:14,862
DOES THAT INDICATE TO YOU, 

3241
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:16,564
PUYALLUP, HE DID THAT TO -- 

3242
01:32:16,564 --> 01:32:18,466
PAUL, HE DID THAT PERHAPS TO 

3243
01:32:18,466 --> 01:32:18,833
GAIN ENTRY? 

3244
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:20,468
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. 

3245
01:32:20,468 --> 01:32:21,469
THE THING WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE 

3246
01:32:21,469 --> 01:32:23,938
HERE IS THE INTENT BEHIND THIS 

3247
01:32:23,938 --> 01:32:25,038
PARTICULAR SHOOTING TODAY. 

3248
01:32:25,038 --> 01:32:25,940
THIS WAS PLANNED. 

3249
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:26,974
YOU KNOW, HE KNEW WHAT HE 

3250
01:32:26,974 --> 01:32:28,109
WANTED TO DO AND HE KNEW WHEN 

3251
01:32:28,109 --> 01:32:29,643
HE WANTED TO DO IT AND WHERE HE 

3252
01:32:29,643 --> 01:32:31,178
WANTED TO DO IT AT. 

3253
01:32:31,178 --> 01:32:33,514
SO, BY HIM SHOOTING THROUGH A 

3254
01:32:33,514 --> 01:32:34,315
WINDOW, BASICALLY, IT MEANS 

3255
01:32:34,315 --> 01:32:35,616
THAT HE GOT TO A PARTICULAR 

3256
01:32:35,616 --> 01:32:37,618
POINT IN THAT BUILDING, HE 

3257
01:32:37,618 --> 01:32:39,053
COULDN'T GET ACCESS TO AND HE 

3258
01:32:39,053 --> 01:32:41,321
SHOT HIS WAY THROUGH IT. 

3259
01:32:41,321 --> 01:32:42,923
>> IT IS JUST HARD TO IMAGINE. 

3260
01:32:42,923 --> 01:32:44,058
>> AND NOTHING WAS GOING TO 

3261
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:45,960
STOP HIM FROM GETTING WHERE HE 

3262
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:46,761
NEEDS TO BE. 

3263
01:32:46,761 --> 01:32:47,928
WHICH SPEAKS TO THE CORE OF WHY 

3264
01:32:47,928 --> 01:32:49,263
HE DID WHAT HE DID. 

3265
01:32:49,263 --> 01:32:50,764
>> YOU TOLD US EARLIER THE FACT 

3266
01:32:50,764 --> 01:32:53,934
HE DOESN'T HAVE AN ID, MEANS HE 

3267
01:32:53,934 --> 01:32:56,103
MAY HAVE NOT PLANNED TO WALK 

3268
01:32:56,103 --> 01:32:58,104
OUT OF THAT BUILDING. 

3269
01:32:58,104 --> 01:33:00,041
>>> FOR THOSE OF YOU JUST 

3270
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:01,775
JOINING US, WHAT WE KNOW SO 

3271
01:33:01,775 --> 01:33:01,976
FAR. 

3272
01:33:01,976 --> 01:33:03,010
AT LEAST 5 PEOPLE ARE DEAD 

3273
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:06,247
AFTER A SHOOTING AT A NEWSPAPER 

3274
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:06,881
IN ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND. 

3275
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:09,450
THIS HAPPNED IN THE OFFICES OF 

3276
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:13,454
THE CAPITAL AGAZETTE, A GAYLE 

3277
01:33:13,454 --> 01:33:16,523
-- GAZETTE, A DAILY PAPER. 

3278
01:33:16,523 --> 01:33:18,659

3279
01:33:18,659 --> 01:33:21,162
REPORTING ON A CRIME AT HIS OWN 

3280
01:33:21,162 --> 01:33:21,562
WORKPLACE. 

3281
01:33:21,562 --> 01:33:22,496
HE TWEETED GUNMAN SHOT THROUGH 

3282
01:33:22,496 --> 01:33:23,531

CAN'T SAY MUCH MORE, DON'T WANT 

3286
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:29,937
TO DECLARE ANYONE DEAD, BUT 

3287
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:30,204

LATER, HE SAID THERE IS NOTHING 

3290
01:33:34,742 --> 01:33:36,444
MORE TERRIFYING THAN HEARING 

3291
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,012
MULTIPLE PEOPLE GET SHOT WHILE 

3292
01:33:38,012 --> 01:33:42,450

3293
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:43,984
THE GUNMAN RELOAD. 

3294
01:33:43,984 --> 01:33:44,485

PLEASE HELP US. 

3299
01:33:52,726 --> 01:33:55,462
>> IT IS JUST HORRIBLE TO 

3300
01:33:55,462 --> 01:33:56,363
EVERYONE TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT 

3301
01:33:56,363 --> 01:33:58,966
THIS PERSON, AN INTERN, A YOUNG 

3302
01:33:58,966 --> 01:34:00,433
PERSON, MUST HAVE BEEN FEELING, 

3303
01:34:00,433 --> 01:34:01,768
THINKING IN THIS MOMENT. 

3304
01:34:01,768 --> 01:34:04,205
AND HE HAD THE WHEREWITHAL TO 

3305
01:34:04,205 --> 01:34:09,877
TRY TO ASK 

3306
01:34:13,914 --> 01:34:15,116
POLICE DID RESPOND AND SAY A 

3307
01:34:15,116 --> 01:34:17,184
SUSPECT IS NOW IN CUSTODY. 

3308
01:34:17,184 --> 01:34:19,220
HAD HE NO ID ON HIM AND HE -- 

3309
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:22,957
HE HAD NO ID ON HIM AND HE IS 

3310
01:34:22,957 --> 01:34:24,124
REFUSING TO IDENTIFY HIMSELF. 

3311
01:34:24,124 --> 01:34:28,262
HE IS WHITE, IN HIS 20s AND HE 

3312
01:34:28,262 --> 01:34:32,466
USED A SHOTGUN IN THE ATTACK. 

3313
01:34:32,466 --> 01:34:33,968
A COUNTY EXECUTIVE SAYS LAW 

3314
01:34:33,968 --> 01:34:35,369
ENFORCEMENT ARRIVED ALMOST 

3315
01:34:35,369 --> 01:34:35,703
IMMEDIATELY. 

3316
01:34:35,703 --> 01:34:38,005
>> THE SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY 

3317
01:34:38,005 --> 01:34:41,976
AND BEING INTERROGATED AT THIS 

3318
01:34:41,976 --> 01:34:42,176
TIME. 

3319
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,911
I WANT TO COMMEND THE PUBLIC 

3320
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:44,712
SAFETY PROFESSIONALS WHO WERE 

3321
01:34:44,712 --> 01:34:53,420
VERY QUICK TO THE SCENE HERE. 

3322
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:54,955
>> MEANWHILE THERE ARE SOME 

3323
01:34:54,955 --> 01:34:57,558
VICTIMS OF THE SHOOTING AND WE 

3324
01:34:57,558 --> 01:34:57,958
DON'T KNOW HOW. 

3325
01:34:57,958 --> 01:34:58,893
SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE WERE 

3326
01:34:58,893 --> 01:34:59,960
INJURED IN THE ATTACK. 

3327
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,762
WE DON'T YET KNOW THE SEVERITY 

3328
01:35:01,762 --> 01:35:02,195
OF THOSE INJURIES. 

3329
01:35:02,195 --> 01:35:03,364
WE WERE TOLD SOMEONE WAS TAKEN 

3330
01:35:03,364 --> 01:35:05,266
TO A TRAUMA CENTER.  

3331
01:35:05,266 --> 01:35:06,667
THE INJURIES WERE DESCRIBED AS 

3332
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:06,934
SERIOUS. 

3333
01:35:06,934 --> 01:35:07,835
THE FACT THAT THESE ARE 

3334
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:10,337
INJURIES THAT WERE CREATED BY A 

3335
01:35:10,337 --> 01:35:13,741
SHOTGUN ALSO INDICATES HOW 

3336
01:35:13,741 --> 01:35:14,942
SERIOUS THESE INJURIES COULD BE 

3337
01:35:14,942 --> 01:35:17,945
AND THAT'S WHAT WE WERE JUST 

3338
01:35:17,945 --> 01:35:18,946
DISCUSSING WITH PAUL VIOLAS, 

3339
01:35:18,946 --> 01:35:21,548
THE CBS NEWS SECURITY ANALYSTS. 

3340
01:35:21,548 --> 01:35:22,516
PAUL, AT THIS POINT WITH THE 

3341
01:35:22,516 --> 01:35:24,418
INFORMATION WE'VE GOTTEN FROM 

3342
01:35:24,418 --> 01:35:25,586
LAW ENFORCEMENT WHAT PICTURE 

3343
01:35:25,586 --> 01:35:27,454
DOES THAT PAINT FOR YOU? 

3344
01:35:27,454 --> 01:35:28,656
>> WELL, THE SAD PART ABOUT 

3345
01:35:28,656 --> 01:35:30,858
THIS IS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT 

3346
01:35:30,858 --> 01:35:35,396
WILL BE  AT A STANDSTILL UNTIL 

3347
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:36,764
THEY CAN GET THE SEARCH 

3348
01:35:36,764 --> 01:35:37,665
WARRANTS APPROVED AND OBTAIN 

3349
01:35:37,665 --> 01:35:39,133
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS 

3350
01:35:39,133 --> 01:35:39,466
INDIVIDUAL. 

3351
01:35:39,466 --> 01:35:42,403
THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT WE JUST 

3352
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:42,836
WON'T KNOW. 

3353
01:35:42,836 --> 01:35:43,470
SIMULTANEOUSLY AS WE MENTIONED 

3354
01:35:43,470 --> 01:35:44,771
BEFORE THE BREAK, THERE'S A LOT 

3355
01:35:44,771 --> 01:35:45,973
OF INFORMATION THAT WILL COME 

3356
01:35:45,973 --> 01:35:47,575
FROM THE CRIME SCENE 

3357
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:47,875
PROCESSING. 

3358
01:35:47,875 --> 01:35:49,677
WE'LL KNOW THE SHELLS THAT HE 

3359
01:35:49,677 --> 01:35:49,877
USED. 

3360
01:35:49,877 --> 01:35:50,578
YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING VERY 

3361
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:51,879
COMPELLING TO ME WHEN YOU WERE 

3362
01:35:51,879 --> 01:35:54,081
TALKING ABOUT AS THE REPORTER 

3363
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:55,682
WAS RECANTING THIS PARTICULAR 

3364
01:35:55,682 --> 01:35:55,949
INCIDENT. 

3365
01:35:55,949 --> 01:35:56,483
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE 

3366
01:35:56,483 --> 01:35:58,118
GRAVITY OF THAT STATEMENT AND 

3367
01:35:58,118 --> 01:36:01,021
THE PASSION AND THE FEAR BEHIND 

3368
01:36:01,021 --> 01:36:01,989
THAT STATEMENT, THINK OF THE 

3369
01:36:01,989 --> 01:36:03,224
SOUND AND THAT'S OFTENTIMES 

3370
01:36:03,224 --> 01:36:04,925
WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T 

3371
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:05,959
REALLY UNDERSTAND WHEN WE THINK 

3372
01:36:05,959 --> 01:36:07,060
OF THIS CRIME SCENE. 

3373
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:09,230
WE SEE IT, BUT WE AREN'T 

3374
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:09,730
HEARING IT. 

3375
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:11,031
WE AREN'T SMELLING IT. 

3376
01:36:11,031 --> 01:36:12,099
THIS INDIVIDUAL IS UNDER A 

3377
01:36:12,099 --> 01:36:12,299
DESK. 

3378
01:36:12,299 --> 01:36:15,002
THE SOUND OF A SHOTGUN RACKING 

3379
01:36:15,002 --> 01:36:15,302
IS LOUD. 

3380
01:36:15,302 --> 01:36:16,203
IT'S INTIMIDATING AND YOU TAKE 

3381
01:36:16,203 --> 01:36:18,305
THESE SHELLS AND WHEN YOU ARE 

3382
01:36:18,305 --> 01:36:20,808
PLACING THEM IN THERE, THAT'S 

3383
01:36:20,808 --> 01:36:21,008
LOUD. 

3384
01:36:21,008 --> 01:36:21,942
IT REVERBERATES AND WHEN YOU'RE 

3385
01:36:21,942 --> 01:36:23,277
THINKING OF THIS PERSON UNDER 

3386
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:25,980
THIS DESK THAT'S LISTENING TO 

3387
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:26,981
THAT SOUND, IT'S TERRIFYING, 

3388
01:36:26,981 --> 01:36:36,624
NOT TO MENTION HE'S THERE 

3389
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:39,026
SMELLING THE GUNFIRE AND 

3390
01:36:39,026 --> 01:36:41,028
LISTENING TO PEOPLE SCREAMING. 

3391
01:36:41,028 --> 01:36:41,962
SO AS POLICE PROCESS THIS, 

3392
01:36:41,962 --> 01:36:43,230
THEY'RE GOING TO EXAMINE NOT 

3393
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:44,664
JUST THE MULTIPLE CRIME SCENES. 

3394
01:36:44,664 --> 01:36:46,333
THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK AT WHERE 

3395
01:36:46,333 --> 01:36:47,434
PEOPLE WERE INJURED, HOW CLOSE 

3396
01:36:47,434 --> 01:36:49,603
IN PROXIMITY WHICH THEY WILL BE 

3397
01:36:49,603 --> 01:36:53,007
ABLE TO ASCERTAIN THE PERSON 

3398
01:36:53,007 --> 01:36:54,475
WAS FROM THAT PARTICULAR 

3399
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:55,509
SHOOTING BECAUSE REMEMBER, WHEN 

3400
01:36:55,509 --> 01:36:57,278
SOMEONE IS USING A SHOTGUN, 

3401
01:36:57,278 --> 01:37:00,915
THIS IS AT THIS DISTANCE, RIGHT 

3402
01:37:00,915 --> 01:37:01,282
ABOUT HERE. 

3403
01:37:01,282 --> 01:37:04,185
WHEN WE LOOK ABOUT 4, 5, 6 FEET 

3404
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:05,419
AWAY, THAT'S THAT DISTANCE FROM 

3405
01:37:05,419 --> 01:37:06,619
A SHOTGUN AND THAT'S 

3406
01:37:06,619 --> 01:37:06,953
FRIGHTENING. 

3407
01:37:06,953 --> 01:37:09,723
SO WHEN THAT REPORTER WAS 

3408
01:37:09,723 --> 01:37:11,058
SAYING NOT ONLY DID THEY SEE IT 

3409
01:37:11,058 --> 01:37:12,726
AND HEAR IT, BUT THEY WERE 

3410
01:37:12,726 --> 01:37:15,729
LISTENING TO THE RELOAD, IT'S A 

3411
01:37:15,729 --> 01:37:16,196
HORRIFYING INCIDENT. 

3412
01:37:16,196 --> 01:37:17,431
RIGHT NOW POLICE ARE GATHERING 

3413
01:37:17,431 --> 01:37:18,131
THE INFORMATION THAT'S SITTING 

3414
01:37:18,131 --> 01:37:19,833
IN FRONT OF THEM IN THAT 

3415
01:37:19,833 --> 01:37:21,335
BUILDING, WHICH IS WHY THEY 

3416
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:22,736
SAID WE CLEARED THE BUILDING 

3417
01:37:22,736 --> 01:37:25,406
BUT NOT THE SCENE AND AT THE 

3418
01:37:25,406 --> 01:37:27,107
SAME TIME THEY'RE GOING TO 

3419
01:37:27,107 --> 01:37:29,176
EXPEDITIOUSLY MOVE AND I MEAN 

3420
01:37:29,176 --> 01:37:29,943
EXPEDITIOUSLY TO SECURE THOSE 

3421
01:37:29,943 --> 01:37:31,278
SEARCH WARRANTS AND START 

3422
01:37:31,278 --> 01:37:32,913
PROCESSING AS MUCH AS THEY CAN 

3423
01:37:32,913 --> 01:37:33,380
ON THIS INDIVIDUAL. 

3424
01:37:33,380 --> 01:37:34,581
>> HOW CAN THEY SECURE THOSE 

3425
01:37:34,581 --> 01:37:35,583
SEARCH WARRANTS IF THEY DON'T 

3426
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:36,783
KNOW WHO THIS GUY IS? 

3427
01:37:36,783 --> 01:37:38,284
>> THEY'RE GOING TO GET HIS 

3428
01:37:38,284 --> 01:37:40,321
PRINTS AND FIND OUT WHO HE IS. 

3429
01:37:40,321 --> 01:37:41,422
EVEN THOUGH HE'S TRYING TO 

3430
01:37:41,422 --> 01:37:42,489
OBSTRUCT JUSTICE AS MUCH AS HE 

3431
01:37:42,489 --> 01:37:44,425
CAN IN THE COURSE OF THIS 

3432
01:37:44,425 --> 01:37:44,992
INVESTIGATION BY PREVENTING 

3433
01:37:44,992 --> 01:37:46,527
THEM TO KNOW WHO HE IS, THEY 

3434
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:47,994
WILL FIND OUT WHO HE IS. 

3435
01:37:47,994 --> 01:37:49,963
>> WHAT IF HE HAS NO RECORD AND 

3436
01:37:49,963 --> 01:37:51,498
HIS PRINTS AREN'T IN THE 

3437
01:37:51,498 --> 01:37:51,731
SYSTEM? 

3438
01:37:51,731 --> 01:37:53,534
>> WELL, THE INDIVIDUAL WILL 

3439
01:37:53,534 --> 01:37:54,702
HAVE PRINTS WHETHER OR NOT IT 

3440
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:56,604
WAS FROM THE ACT THAT HE CAME 

3441
01:37:56,604 --> 01:37:57,604
THROUGH A SCHOOL SYSTEM OR WHEN 

3442
01:37:57,604 --> 01:38:00,307
YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS 

3443
01:38:00,307 --> 01:38:03,277
IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY WHERE 

3444
01:38:03,277 --> 01:38:04,511
WE'RE FINGERPRINTED FROM WORK 

3445
01:38:04,511 --> 01:38:06,046
AND SCHOOL AND PROFESSIONAL 

3446
01:38:06,046 --> 01:38:08,015
AFFILIATIONS AND SOCIAL 

3447
01:38:08,015 --> 01:38:08,882
AFFILIATIONS, CHANCES ARE THAT 

3448
01:38:08,882 --> 01:38:09,917
THOSE PRINTS WILL LEAD TO 

3449
01:38:09,917 --> 01:38:12,386
SOMETHING, BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU 

3450
01:38:12,386 --> 01:38:16,223
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT A 

3451
01:38:16,223 --> 01:38:17,625
PLACE LIKE THIS, THEY ARE GOING 

3452
01:38:17,625 --> 01:38:18,926
TO PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS. 

3453
01:38:18,926 --> 01:38:20,293
THEY WILL FIND OUT WHO HE IS. 

3454
01:38:20,293 --> 01:38:21,962
>> NOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE 

3455
01:38:21,962 --> 01:38:24,031
THIS HAPPENED, THIS WAS A 

3456
01:38:24,031 --> 01:38:24,331
WORKPLACE. 

3457
01:38:24,331 --> 01:38:25,132
THIS IS A NEWSPAPER. 

3458
01:38:25,132 --> 01:38:27,234
WHAT ARE THE CLUES THAT ARE 

3459
01:38:27,234 --> 01:38:29,503
INDICATING TO YOU WHAT KIND OF 

3460
01:38:29,503 --> 01:38:29,903
CRIME THIS IS? 

3461
01:38:29,903 --> 01:38:31,905
>> WELL, THE FACT THAT THE 

3462
01:38:31,905 --> 01:38:33,607
INDIVIDUAL USED A SHOTGUN TELLS 

3463
01:38:33,607 --> 01:38:34,808
ME THAT IT'S PERSONAL. 

3464
01:38:34,808 --> 01:38:37,611
THE FACT THAT HE'S COMING INTO 

3465
01:38:37,611 --> 01:38:41,115
THE BUILDING, BUT HE DOESN'T 

3466
01:38:41,115 --> 01:38:43,083
HAVE -- HE'S TRYING TO REALLY 

3467
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:44,785
SHADE HIS IDENTITY AS MUCH AS 

3468
01:38:44,785 --> 01:38:47,821
POSSIBLE TELLS ME ONE OF TWO 

3469
01:38:47,821 --> 01:38:48,955
THINGS, ONE, THAT HE HAD 

3470
01:38:48,955 --> 01:38:50,157
DISDAIN TOWARDS THE NEWSPAPER, 

3471
01:38:50,157 --> 01:38:51,825
THAT HE HAD SOMETHING AGAINST 

3472
01:38:51,825 --> 01:38:53,827
SOMETHING IN THAT BUILDING THAT 

3473
01:38:53,827 --> 01:38:55,829
HE WAS JUST TAKING THAT 

3474
01:38:55,829 --> 01:38:56,830
PERSONAL VENDETTA OUT AGAINST 

3475
01:38:56,830 --> 01:38:59,333
OR THE LAST PART ABOUT THAT WAS 

3476
01:38:59,333 --> 01:39:00,934
THAT CLEARLY THAT THERE WAS 

3477
01:39:00,934 --> 01:39:02,903
SOME TYPE OF DOMESTIC ISSUE 

3478
01:39:02,903 --> 01:39:04,204
INVOLVED WITH THIS INDIVIDUAL. 

3479
01:39:04,204 --> 01:39:06,006
WHEN YOU THINK OF THAT, WE ALSO 

3480
01:39:06,006 --> 01:39:07,207
MARRY TOGETHER HIS AGE. 

3481
01:39:07,207 --> 01:39:09,109
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT AGE, THE 

3482
01:39:09,109 --> 01:39:11,011
PROBABILITY OF A WHITE MALE AT 

3483
01:39:11,011 --> 01:39:14,581
THAT AGE HAVING SOME TYPE OF 

3484
01:39:14,581 --> 01:39:16,317
DOMESTIC SITUATION IS PRETTY 

3485
01:39:16,317 --> 01:39:17,952
HIGH WHEN YOU MARRY DOWN THE 

3486
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:19,253
PROBABILITY OF RISK TO THAT 

3487
01:39:19,253 --> 01:39:19,586
DEMOGRAPHIC. 

3488
01:39:19,586 --> 01:39:21,322
SO THAT'S WHERE I WOULD LAY 

3489
01:39:21,322 --> 01:39:22,022
THAT OUT NOW. 

3490
01:39:22,022 --> 01:39:23,624
>> TYPICALLY SPEAKING IN VERY 

3491
01:39:23,624 --> 01:39:24,825
GENERAL TERMS WHEN YOU SEE A 

3492
01:39:24,825 --> 01:39:28,128
WHITE MALE IN HIS 20s INVOLVED 

3493
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:29,430
IN A SHOOTING, THAT POINTS TO 

3494
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:30,831
YOU, INDICATES TO YOU IF IT'S 

3495
01:39:30,831 --> 01:39:33,968
IN A WORKPLACE LIKE THAT IT 

3496
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:34,702
MIGHT BE DOMESTIC. 

3497
01:39:34,702 --> 01:39:35,169
>> DOMESTIC RELATED. 

3498
01:39:35,169 --> 01:39:37,037
>> SO SOMEONE HE WAS IN A 

3499
01:39:37,037 --> 01:39:38,505
RELATIONSHIP WITH OR AN EX-GIRL 

3500
01:39:38,505 --> 01:39:40,607
FRIEND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? 

3501
01:39:40,607 --> 01:39:40,873
>> RIGHT. 

3502
01:39:40,873 --> 01:39:42,276
OR IF THIS PERSON HAD SOME TYPE 

3503
01:39:42,276 --> 01:39:43,610
OF AFFILIATION WITH SOME TYPE 

3504
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:45,411
OF RADICALLIST GROUP AND I'M 

3505
01:39:45,411 --> 01:39:47,714
NOT SAYING ISLAMIST AT ALL. 

3506
01:39:47,714 --> 01:39:49,316
I'M SAYING A RADICALLIST GROUP 

3507
01:39:49,316 --> 01:39:50,984
THAT FELT THERE WAS SOME TYPE 

3508
01:39:50,984 --> 01:39:54,121
OF ISSUE THAT WAS COVERED WITH 

3509
01:39:54,121 --> 01:39:54,488
THE NEWSPAPER. 

3510
01:39:54,488 --> 01:39:57,157
THIS IS WITH EVEN IF IT WAS THE 

3511
01:39:57,157 --> 01:39:58,926
NEWSPAPER BECAUSE THERE ARE 

3512
01:39:58,926 --> 01:40:00,227
OTHER EMPLOYERS THERE, BUT 

3513
01:40:00,227 --> 01:40:02,096
WE'RE KIND OF SPITBALLING AT 

3514
01:40:02,096 --> 01:40:03,530
THIS POINT LOOKING AT THIS. 

3515
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:04,965
THAT COULD ALSO BE AN AGENDA 

3516
01:40:04,965 --> 01:40:05,999
BEHIND THAT PARTICULAR SHOOTER. 

3517
01:40:05,999 --> 01:40:07,067
>> YOU MENTIONED SO 

3518
01:40:07,067 --> 01:40:08,836
DEFINITIVELY THE FACT IT WAS A 

3519
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:09,837
SHOTGUN MEANS IT'S PERSONAL. 

3520
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:11,205
>> VERY MUCH SO. 

3521
01:40:11,205 --> 01:40:12,506
>> FOR PEOPLE NOT FAMILIAR WITH 

3522
01:40:12,506 --> 01:40:14,708
FIREARMS, WHY IS THAT? 

3523
01:40:14,708 --> 01:40:15,809
>> OKAY. 

3524
01:40:15,809 --> 01:40:17,176
SO A FIREARM, WHEN YOU THINK IF 

3525
01:40:17,176 --> 01:40:19,413
SOMEONE COMES IN WITH A 

3526
01:40:19,413 --> 01:40:20,314
HANDGUN, THEY HAVE CLEARLY AN 

3527
01:40:20,314 --> 01:40:21,882
INTENT BEHIND THAT, AS THEY 

3528
01:40:21,882 --> 01:40:22,749
WOULD A SHOTGUN. 

3529
01:40:22,749 --> 01:40:24,218
A SHOTGUN IS ALMOST LIKE 

3530
01:40:24,218 --> 01:40:25,953
SOMEONE USING A KNIFE IN THE 

3531
01:40:25,953 --> 01:40:27,321
COURSE OF A PERSONAL ATTACK, 

3532
01:40:27,321 --> 01:40:29,022
WHICH IS WHY WHEN YOU SEE A 

3533
01:40:29,022 --> 01:40:32,960
KNIFE USED IN AN ATTACK, IT'S 

3534
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:33,627
CLOSE. 

3535
01:40:33,627 --> 01:40:34,661
IT'S IN CLOSE. 

3536
01:40:34,661 --> 01:40:36,296
IT'S THAT PERSONAL CONTACT. 

3537
01:40:36,296 --> 01:40:36,697
THERE'S DISDAIN. 

3538
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:39,400
THERE'S ANGER AND IT'S REALLY, 

3539
01:40:39,400 --> 01:40:39,800
REALLY PERSONAL. 

3540
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:40,734
THE SHOTGUN IS REALLY THE 

3541
01:40:40,734 --> 01:40:43,303
EQUIVALENT TO THAT IN A FIREARM 

3542
01:40:43,303 --> 01:40:44,905
WHERE THAT PERSON WANTS TO 

3543
01:40:44,905 --> 01:40:46,306
CAUSE AS MUCH DAMAGE AND AS 

3544
01:40:46,306 --> 01:40:48,809
MUCH PAIN AS POSSIBLE. 

3545
01:40:50,644 --> 01:40:54,014
THE LONG GUN WE'VE SEEN USED 

3546
01:40:54,014 --> 01:40:56,316
BEFORE IS MORE FOR MASS APPEAL, 

3547
01:40:56,316 --> 01:40:59,186
MASS EFFECT, MASS BODY COUNT OR 

3548
01:40:59,186 --> 01:41:00,486
FROM A LONGER DISTANCE. 

3549
01:41:00,486 --> 01:41:03,023
>> AUTOMATIC WEAPONS? 

3550
01:41:03,023 --> 01:41:03,757
>> CORRECT. 

3551
01:41:03,757 --> 01:41:05,325
>> AR15 STYLE WEAPONS? 

3552
01:41:05,325 --> 01:41:05,591
>> RIGHT. 

3553
01:41:05,591 --> 01:41:06,927
WHEN WE COVERED THE SHOOTING IN 

3554
01:41:06,927 --> 01:41:08,428
VEGAS AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 

3555
01:41:08,428 --> 01:41:10,631
THE TYPE OF LONG GUN RIFLE THAT 

3556
01:41:10,631 --> 01:41:15,035
PERSON WAS USING FROM THAT 

3557
01:41:15,035 --> 01:41:17,404
DISTANCE, IT WAS BECAUSE OF 

3558
01:41:17,404 --> 01:41:19,273
MAXIMUM EFFECT, MAXIMUM BODY 

3559
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:19,506
COUNT. 

3560
01:41:19,506 --> 01:41:22,109
THE SHOTGUN IS UP CLOSE. 

3561
01:41:22,109 --> 01:41:24,178
IT'S PERSONAL AND IT'S NOT JUST 

3562
01:41:24,178 --> 01:41:24,711
FOR ONE PERSON. 

3563
01:41:24,711 --> 01:41:25,979
IT'S FOR PEOPLE AROUND THAT 

3564
01:41:25,979 --> 01:41:26,212
PERSON. 

3565
01:41:26,212 --> 01:41:28,215
>> I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME 

3566
01:41:28,215 --> 01:41:28,949
INFORMATION WE'VE JUST LEARNED. 

3567
01:41:28,949 --> 01:41:30,783
WE HAVE A STATEMENT FROM THE 

3568
01:41:30,783 --> 01:41:33,954
NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT 

3569
01:41:33,954 --> 01:41:35,422
SAYS THEIR COUNTERTERRORISM 

3570
01:41:35,422 --> 01:41:36,523
TEAMS ARE BEING SENT TO MEDIA 

3571
01:41:36,523 --> 01:41:38,158
ORGANIZATIONS IN NEW YORK CITY. 

3572
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:41,528
I'M GOING TO READ SOME OF THIS. 

3573
01:41:41,528 --> 01:41:44,331
IT SAYS, THE NYPD IS MONITORING 

3574
01:41:44,331 --> 01:41:48,101
REPORT OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER AT 

3575
01:41:48,101 --> 01:41:56,710
THE CAPITAL GAZETTE IN 

3576
01:41:56,710 --> 01:41:57,177
ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND. 

3577
01:41:57,177 --> 01:41:58,011
THESE DEPLOYMENTS ARE NOT BASED 

3578
01:41:58,011 --> 01:41:58,979
ON SPECIFIC THREAT INFORMATION 

3579
01:41:58,979 --> 01:42:01,381
BUT RATHER OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE 

3580
01:42:01,381 --> 01:42:02,382
OF CAUTION UNTIL WE LEARN MORE 

3581
01:42:02,382 --> 01:42:03,984
ABOUT THE SUSPECT AND MOTIVES 

3582
01:42:03,984 --> 01:42:06,119
BEHIND THE MARYLAND SHOOTING." 

3583
01:42:06,119 --> 01:42:08,122
IT SAYS HERE, " IT HAS BECOME A 

3584
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:12,759
STANDARD PRACTICE TO SHIFT 

3585
01:42:12,759 --> 01:42:13,392
RESOURCES STRATEGICALLY DURING 

3586
01:42:13,392 --> 01:42:14,127
ACTIVE SHOOTER OR TERRORIST 

3587
01:42:14,127 --> 01:42:14,394
EVENTS." 

3588
01:42:14,394 --> 01:42:16,330
TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 

3589
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:16,630
THAT, PAUL. 

3590
01:42:16,630 --> 01:42:18,065
WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS IN ONE 

3591
01:42:18,065 --> 01:42:19,633
PART OF THE COUNTRY, THE RIPPLE 

3592
01:42:19,633 --> 01:42:21,935
EFFECT THAT TAKES PLACE 

3593
01:42:21,935 --> 01:42:23,403
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE NATION. 

3594
01:42:23,403 --> 01:42:23,736
>> CERTAINLY. 

3595
01:42:23,736 --> 01:42:24,370
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING 

3596
01:42:24,370 --> 01:42:26,906
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT COULD BE 

3597
01:42:26,906 --> 01:42:27,908
CATEGORIZED IN TERMS OF AN 

3598
01:42:27,908 --> 01:42:30,110
ATTACK FOCUSED ON A PARTICULAR 

3599
01:42:30,110 --> 01:42:30,911
VERTICAL MARKET. 

3600
01:42:30,911 --> 01:42:32,813
IF WE'RE LOOKING AT AN ATTACK 

3601
01:42:32,813 --> 01:42:33,914
FOCUSED ON THE MEDIA, LET'S 

3602
01:42:33,914 --> 01:42:35,148
THINK ABOUT THAT. 

3603
01:42:35,148 --> 01:42:36,950
WE IN THE MEDIA, WE'RE SENDING 

3604
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:40,754
MESSAGES OUT WITHOUT AN AGENDA. 

3605
01:42:40,754 --> 01:42:42,055
ESPECIALLY HERE AT CBS. 

3606
01:42:42,055 --> 01:42:42,722
IT'S PURE JOURNALISM. 

3607
01:42:42,722 --> 01:42:43,357
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT 

3608
01:42:43,357 --> 01:42:45,425
EVERYBODY IS GOING TO LIKE IT. 

3609
01:42:45,425 --> 01:42:46,326
THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GOING 

3610
01:42:46,326 --> 01:42:48,061
TO MAKE A LOT OF FANS JUST 

3611
01:42:48,061 --> 01:42:49,062
BECAUSE YOU'RE TELLING THE 

3612
01:42:49,062 --> 01:42:51,765
TRUTH AND YOU MAY, IN FACT, 

3613
01:42:51,765 --> 01:42:53,333
ATTRACT THAT RADICAL TYPE OF 

3614
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:53,566
PERSON. 

3615
01:42:53,566 --> 01:42:55,035
WE DON'T KNOW WHO THIS PERSON 

3616
01:42:55,035 --> 01:42:55,235
WAS. 

3617
01:42:55,235 --> 01:42:57,104
WE JUST KNOW IT WAS IN THAT 

3618
01:42:57,104 --> 01:42:58,405
BUILDING, BUT POLICE WILL ERR 

3619
01:42:58,405 --> 01:42:59,906
ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION. 

3620
01:42:59,906 --> 01:43:00,573
KNOWING THE POLICE COMMISSIONER 

3621
01:43:00,573 --> 01:43:02,409
IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK I AM 

3622
01:43:02,409 --> 01:43:03,911
NOT SURPRISED THAT THEY'RE 

3623
01:43:03,911 --> 01:43:05,179
GOING TO TAKE EVERY PREEMPTIVE 

3624
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:06,747
PRECAUTION THAT IF, IN FACT, 

3625
01:43:06,747 --> 01:43:08,515
THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS FOCUSED ON 

3626
01:43:08,515 --> 01:43:11,185
THE MEDIA AND IF, IN FACT, AS 

3627
01:43:11,185 --> 01:43:12,686
YOU POINTED OUT BEFORE WHICH 

3628
01:43:12,686 --> 01:43:16,056
WAS A VERY ASTUTE POINT, IF, IN 

3629
01:43:16,056 --> 01:43:18,758
FACT, THIS HAS A COPYCAT 

3630
01:43:18,758 --> 01:43:19,927
ATTACHMENT TO IT, THEN POLICE 

3631
01:43:19,927 --> 01:43:22,929
ARE GOING TO ACT PREEMPTIVELY 

3632
01:43:22,929 --> 01:43:24,731
TODAY AND LOOK AND SEE AND 

3633
01:43:24,731 --> 01:43:26,033
REALIZE WE WANT TO GET AHEAD OF 

3634
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:28,435
THE CURVE AND IF THERE'S EVEN A 

3635
01:43:28,435 --> 01:43:30,103
SHADOW OF DOUBT THAT THIS MAY, 

3636
01:43:30,103 --> 01:43:32,306
IN FACT, CONTINUE TO OTHER 

3637
01:43:32,306 --> 01:43:33,507
CITIES, WE'RE GOING TO BE OKAY 

3638
01:43:33,507 --> 01:43:33,707
HERE. 

3639
01:43:33,707 --> 01:43:35,108
AND I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF 

3640
01:43:35,108 --> 01:43:36,610
IT'S NOT JUST HERE IN NEW YORK, 

3641
01:43:36,610 --> 01:43:38,812
BUT IF IT'S IN OTHER CITIES 

3642
01:43:38,812 --> 01:43:39,279
AROUND THE COUNTRY. 

3643
01:43:39,279 --> 01:43:41,114
>> PAUL, YOU JUST SAID THAT AND 

3644
01:43:41,114 --> 01:43:42,282
I JUST GOT THIS REPORT RIGHT 

3645
01:43:42,282 --> 01:43:43,617
HERE THE CHICAGO POLICE 

3646
01:43:43,617 --> 01:43:45,018
DEPARTMENT IS ALSO MAKING 

3647
01:43:45,018 --> 01:43:46,920
VISITS TO MEDIA OUTLETS. 

3648
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:48,455
THAT INCLUDES, OF COURSE, OUR 

3649
01:43:48,455 --> 01:43:50,357
LOCAL STATION IN CHICAGO WBBM 

3650
01:43:50,357 --> 01:43:52,726
AND OTHER STATIONS AND 

3651
01:43:52,726 --> 01:43:53,493
NEWSPAPERS BASED IN CHICAGO. 

3652
01:43:53,493 --> 01:43:54,961
THIS, I'M SURE, AS YOU 

3653
01:43:54,961 --> 01:43:56,330
MENTIONED, IS PROBABLY 

3654
01:43:56,330 --> 01:43:57,164
HAPPENING IN OTHER CITIES 

3655
01:43:57,164 --> 01:43:58,031
ACROSS THE NATION BECAUSE AT 

3656
01:43:58,031 --> 01:44:00,234
THIS POINT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT 

3657
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:00,934
HIS MOTIVE WAS. 

3658
01:44:00,934 --> 01:44:02,102
>> NO, WE DON'T KNOW. 

3659
01:44:02,102 --> 01:44:04,304
>> WAS IT AN ATTACK ON THE 

3660
01:44:04,304 --> 01:44:05,105
MEDIA, ON JOURNALISM? 

3661
01:44:05,105 --> 01:44:06,640
WAS IT A DOMESTIC ATTACK WITH 

3662
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:08,541
SOMEONE HE KNEW INSIDE? 

3663
01:44:08,541 --> 01:44:10,811
IS THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER A 

3664
01:44:10,811 --> 01:44:11,211
FORMER EMPLOYEE? 

3665
01:44:11,211 --> 01:44:12,212
WE STILL DON'T HAVE THAT 

3666
01:44:12,212 --> 01:44:13,980
INFORMATION AND IT SOUND LIKE 

3667
01:44:13,980 --> 01:44:15,616
POLICE DON'T KNOW YET EITHER 

3668
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:17,384
BECAUSE THIS PERSON ISN'T EVEN 

3669
01:44:17,384 --> 01:44:17,784
GIVING HIS NAME. 

3670
01:44:17,784 --> 01:44:19,553
>> THE INTERESTING PART HERE IS 

3671
01:44:19,553 --> 01:44:21,321
THEY STILL HAVEN'T TOLD US HOW 

3672
01:44:21,321 --> 01:44:22,856
THEY APPREHENDED HIM AND I 

3673
01:44:22,856 --> 01:44:24,625
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE 

3674
01:44:24,625 --> 01:44:25,425
NOT RELEASING THAT, BUT THAT'S 

3675
01:44:25,425 --> 01:44:27,561
GOING TO TELL US A LOT. 

3676
01:44:27,561 --> 01:44:28,862
DID HE SURRENDER? 

3677
01:44:28,862 --> 01:44:30,664
DID HE WALK OUT? 

3678
01:44:30,664 --> 01:44:31,664
DID HE SEE POLICE? 

3679
01:44:31,664 --> 01:44:33,166
DID HE SURRENDER OR DID THEY 

3680
01:44:33,166 --> 01:44:34,468
COME UP ON HIM? 

3681
01:44:34,468 --> 01:44:35,235
WE DON'T KNOW THAT. 

3682
01:44:35,235 --> 01:44:37,204
WE NEED TO KNOW THAT, BUT WE 

3683
01:44:37,204 --> 01:44:39,105
HAVE TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF 

3684
01:44:39,105 --> 01:44:39,372
CAUTION. 

3685
01:44:39,372 --> 01:44:40,607
IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 

3686
01:44:40,607 --> 01:44:41,908
COMMUNITY AND YOU POINTED OUT 

3687
01:44:41,908 --> 01:44:43,710
BEFORE, WE ARE GOING TO ERR ON 

3688
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:44,711
THE SIDE OF CAUTION AND WE'LL 

3689
01:44:44,711 --> 01:44:46,579
SEE THIS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 

3690
01:44:46,579 --> 01:44:48,115
I'M NOT SURPRISED ABOUT THAT. 

3691
01:44:48,948 --> 01:44:50,717
IF THIS WAS FOCUSED ON THE 

3692
01:44:50,717 --> 01:44:52,319
MEDIA AND WE DON'T KNOW THAT TO 

3693
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:54,421
BE TRUE, BUT IF IT WAS FOCUSED 

3694
01:44:54,421 --> 01:44:56,056
ON THE MEDIA, WE NEED TO 

3695
01:44:56,056 --> 01:44:57,457
PREEMPTIVELY PROTECT OUR MEDIA 

3696
01:44:57,457 --> 01:44:58,625
ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW 

3697
01:44:58,625 --> 01:45:01,528
AND YEAR GOING TO SEE THAT 

3698
01:45:01,528 --> 01:45:02,662
ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- WE'RE 

3699
01:45:02,662 --> 01:45:04,464
GOING TO SEE THAT ACROSS THE 

3700
01:45:04,464 --> 01:45:05,031
COUNTRY. 

3701
01:45:05,031 --> 01:45:06,633
>> IN THE LATEST POLICE 

3702
01:45:06,633 --> 01:45:07,834
BRIEFING THEY SAY POLICE 

3703
01:45:07,834 --> 01:45:09,403
ENGAGED THE SUSPECT, BUT THEY 

3704
01:45:09,403 --> 01:45:09,836
DON'T KNOW HOW. 

3705
01:45:09,836 --> 01:45:10,904
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT WAYS 

3706
01:45:10,904 --> 01:45:12,972
THEY COULD HAVE ENGAGED THE 

3707
01:45:12,972 --> 01:45:13,239
SUSPECT? 

3708
01:45:13,239 --> 01:45:16,009
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY SAW 

3709
01:45:16,009 --> 01:45:16,310
HIM. 

3710
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:17,911
FROM SOMEONE THAT'S DONE THIS, 

3711
01:45:17,911 --> 01:45:19,212
IT KEEPS COMING BACK TO ME 

3712
01:45:19,212 --> 01:45:21,248
ABOUT WHERE DID THEY SEE HIM? 

3713
01:45:21,248 --> 01:45:22,315
WHERE WAS HE CONFRONTED? 

3714
01:45:22,315 --> 01:45:24,217
WAS HE OUTSIDE OR INSIDE THE 

3715
01:45:24,217 --> 01:45:24,484
BUILDING? 

3716
01:45:24,484 --> 01:45:25,318
DID HE WALK OUT? 

3717
01:45:25,318 --> 01:45:26,920
DID HE DROP HIS GUN? 

3718
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:29,122
DID THEY COME INSIDE THE 

3719
01:45:29,122 --> 01:45:29,389
BUILDING? 

3720
01:45:29,389 --> 01:45:30,457
IT JUST TELLS US SO MUCH. 

3721
01:45:30,457 --> 01:45:31,958
THERE ARE SO MANY UNANSWERED 

3722
01:45:31,958 --> 01:45:33,160
QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THAT, 

3723
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:35,929
BUT WHEN THEY SAY WE CLEARED 

3724
01:45:35,929 --> 01:45:36,730
THE BUILDING, BUT WE HAVEN'T 

3725
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:38,064
CLEARED THE SCENE, THAT MEANS 

3726
01:45:38,064 --> 01:45:39,766
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE SCENE. 

3727
01:45:39,766 --> 01:45:42,068
SO WHEN POLICE CAME INTO THE 

3728
01:45:42,068 --> 01:45:43,003
BUILDING, DID THEY ENTER THE 

3729
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:44,538
BUILDING AND NOTICE THE 

3730
01:45:44,538 --> 01:45:45,672
INDIVIDUAL RIGHT AWAY? 

3731
01:45:45,672 --> 01:45:46,640
WERE THEY TOLD THAT HE'S 

3732
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:46,907
UPSTAIRS? 

3733
01:45:46,907 --> 01:45:49,910
DID THEY HAVE TO CLEAR 

3734
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:50,177
UPSTAIRS? 

3735
01:45:50,177 --> 01:45:51,878
HOW MANY POLICE RESPONDED? 

3736
01:45:51,878 --> 01:45:53,714
WAS IT JUST PATROL? 

3737
01:45:53,714 --> 01:45:58,285
DID THEY HAVE A TACTICAL UNIT 

3738
01:45:58,285 --> 01:45:58,585
AVAILABLE? 

3739
01:45:58,585 --> 01:45:59,553
THERE'S A LOT MORE WE DON'T 

3740
01:45:59,553 --> 01:46:01,054
KNOW THAN WHAT WE DO KNOW AT 

3741
01:46:01,054 --> 01:46:02,456
THIS POINT AND UNFORTUNATELY 

3742
01:46:02,456 --> 01:46:03,857
THAT'S JUST WHERE IT IS NOW. 

3743
01:46:03,857 --> 01:46:05,759
>> HOW ALL THIS HAPPENED IN 

3744
01:46:05,759 --> 01:46:06,560
JUST A MINUTE'S TIME THAT 

3745
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,462
POLICE SAY IT TOOK THEM TO GET 

3746
01:46:08,462 --> 01:46:09,162
TO THIS SCENE. 

3747
01:46:09,162 --> 01:46:09,529
>> 60 SECONDS. 

3748
01:46:09,529 --> 01:46:11,465
>> AND WHAT THAT MUST HAVE 

3749
01:46:11,465 --> 01:46:12,999
LOOKED LIKE AS OFFICERS WERE 

3750
01:46:12,999 --> 01:46:14,534
ENTERING THIS BUILDING AND 

3751
01:46:14,534 --> 01:46:15,969
SEEING PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN SHOT 

3752
01:46:15,969 --> 01:46:17,204
DEAD, HAVING TO THEN SEE WHO 

3753
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:21,608
COULD BE SAVED AND LOOK FOR THE 

3754
01:46:21,608 --> 01:46:21,874
SUSPECT. 

3755
01:46:21,874 --> 01:46:22,141
>> RIGHT. 

3756
01:46:22,141 --> 01:46:22,709
THINK ABOUT THIS. 

3757
01:46:22,709 --> 01:46:24,010
AS WE'RE TALKING THROUGH THIS 

3758
01:46:24,010 --> 01:46:25,946
RIGHT NOW, ANY ABOUT WHAT THIS 

3759
01:46:25,946 --> 01:46:26,246
LOOKS LIKE. 

3760
01:46:26,246 --> 01:46:27,714
AN -- THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS 

3761
01:46:27,714 --> 01:46:28,014
LOOKS LIKE. 

3762
01:46:28,014 --> 01:46:29,616
AN OFFICER COMES UP AND 

3763
01:46:29,616 --> 01:46:30,517
APPROACH THE BUILDING. 

3764
01:46:30,517 --> 01:46:31,618
IF, IN FACT, THEY CAUGHT THIS 

3765
01:46:31,618 --> 01:46:33,553
PERSON INSIDE THE BUILDING, 

3766
01:46:33,553 --> 01:46:36,089
THEY'RE GOING TO SEE BROKEN 

3767
01:46:36,089 --> 01:46:37,224
GLASS, TERRIFIED PEOPLE, MAYBE 

3768
01:46:37,224 --> 01:46:37,591
BLOOD SPATTERS. 

3769
01:46:37,591 --> 01:46:39,192
THEY HAVE TO BE VERY CONSCIOUS 

3770
01:46:39,192 --> 01:46:39,592
WHERE THEY STEP. 

3771
01:46:39,592 --> 01:46:40,827
THEY'RE LISTENING TO 

3772
01:46:40,827 --> 01:46:41,361
EVERYTHING. 

3773
01:46:41,361 --> 01:46:42,896
THEY'RE SMELLING FOR GUNPOWDER. 

3774
01:46:42,896 --> 01:46:43,730
THE CLOSER THEY GET -- 

3775
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:45,866
>> THE STRONGER THE SMELL. 

3776
01:46:45,866 --> 01:46:46,166
>> EXACTLY. 

3777
01:46:46,166 --> 01:46:48,568
SO THEY'RE LISTENING, SMELLING, 

3778
01:46:48,568 --> 01:46:49,035
OBSERVING EVERYTHING. 

3779
01:46:49,035 --> 01:46:50,070
I'VE NOT BEEN IN THIS BUILDING, 

3780
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:51,604
BUT LET'S LOOK AROUND US. 

3781
01:46:51,604 --> 01:46:53,240
HOW MANY POINTS OF ENTRY ARE 

3782
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:53,707
THERE? 

3783
01:46:53,707 --> 01:46:55,742
IS THERE A STAIRWAY HERE? 

3784
01:46:55,742 --> 01:46:56,943
IS AN ELEVATOR THERE? 

3785
01:46:56,943 --> 01:46:58,445
ARE THERE TWO POINTS OF ENTRY 

3786
01:46:58,445 --> 01:46:58,645
HERE? 

3787
01:46:58,645 --> 01:46:59,446
I DON'T KNOW. 

3788
01:46:59,446 --> 01:47:00,279
WHERE DO THEY GO? 

3789
01:47:00,279 --> 01:47:02,249
SO THEY HAVE TO BE POINTED IN A 

3790
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:02,916
CERTAIN DIRECTION. 

3791
01:47:02,916 --> 01:47:06,553
SO ALL OF THAT WHEN POLICE 

3792
01:47:06,553 --> 01:47:08,288
APPROACH HERE AND REMEMBER IF 

3793
01:47:08,288 --> 01:47:09,456
IT'S 60 SECONDS, IN ALL 

3794
01:47:09,456 --> 01:47:10,056
PROBABILITY THOSE ARE PATROL 

3795
01:47:10,056 --> 01:47:11,057
OFFICERS THAT ARE RESPONDING. 

3796
01:47:11,057 --> 01:47:12,759
SO WOMEN AND MEN IN UNIFORM 

3797
01:47:12,759 --> 01:47:14,561
PATROLLING AT THAT POINT PULL 

3798
01:47:14,561 --> 01:47:15,194
UP TO THERE. 

3799
01:47:15,194 --> 01:47:17,798
THERE'S NO BACKUP AT THIS POINT 

3800
01:47:17,798 --> 01:47:19,131
IF IT'S 60 SECONDS. 

3801
01:47:19,131 --> 01:47:19,465
THEY'RE LIVE. 

3802
01:47:19,465 --> 01:47:21,067
THIS THING IS FLUID. 

3803
01:47:21,067 --> 01:47:22,436
SO THEY'RE GOING TO RESPOND TO 

3804
01:47:22,436 --> 01:47:23,803
THAT BUILDING AS QUICKLY AS 

3805
01:47:23,803 --> 01:47:24,070
POSSIBLE. 

3806
01:47:24,070 --> 01:47:25,105
CREDIT TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT 

3807
01:47:25,105 --> 01:47:27,941
AND TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. 

3808
01:47:27,941 --> 01:47:28,308
THINK ABOUT IT. 

3809
01:47:28,308 --> 01:47:29,943
SHOTS FIRED, GLASS BROKEN AND 

3810
01:47:29,943 --> 01:47:31,177
THEY'RE RUNNING INTO IT. 

3811
01:47:31,177 --> 01:47:32,712
SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY 

3812
01:47:32,712 --> 01:47:34,447
WERE DOING AT THAT MOMENT. 

3813
01:47:34,447 --> 01:47:35,715
>> FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN 

3814
01:47:35,715 --> 01:47:36,883
THROUGH THESE TYPES OF 

3815
01:47:36,883 --> 01:47:39,219
SITUATIONS, HOW DO YOU MAKE 

3816
01:47:39,219 --> 01:47:40,954
THAT DECISION BETWEEN SEEING 

3817
01:47:40,954 --> 01:47:42,455
SOMEONE WHO IS HURT AND 

3818
01:47:42,455 --> 01:47:43,924
RESPONDING TO THEM VERSUS 

3819
01:47:43,924 --> 01:47:46,960
LOOKING FOR THE SHOOTER? 

3820
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:47,560
>> IT'S INSTANTANEOUSLY. 

3821
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:49,162
THE MOMENT THAT YOU CAN SEE 

3822
01:47:49,162 --> 01:47:50,564
WHERE SOMEBODY IS AT THAT 

3823
01:47:50,564 --> 01:47:53,266
POINT, IF THERE ARE STILL SHOTS 

3824
01:47:53,266 --> 01:47:57,938
BEING FIRED, YOU HEAR THAT THE 

3825
01:47:57,938 --> 01:48:02,342
SITUATION IS FLUID AND YOU SEE 

3826
01:48:02,342 --> 01:48:03,810
PEOPLE AT GROUND, YOU CAN'T 

3827
01:48:03,810 --> 01:48:05,745
STOP AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME AS 

3828
01:48:05,745 --> 01:48:07,914
MUCH AS YOU WISH YOU COULD TO 

3829
01:48:07,914 --> 01:48:09,048
ATTEND TO THAT PERSON. 

3830
01:48:09,048 --> 01:48:10,550
LET'S SAY YOU AND I ARE 

3831
01:48:10,550 --> 01:48:11,584
PARTNERS IN THAT BUILDING. 

3832
01:48:11,584 --> 01:48:12,719
WE CAN'T STOP AT THAT MOMENT 

3833
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:14,087
BECAUSE SHOT ARE BEING FIRED 

3834
01:48:14,087 --> 01:48:15,121
AROUND THAT BUILDING. 

3835
01:48:15,121 --> 01:48:16,656
OUR JOB, AS MUCH AS WE WOULD 

3836
01:48:16,656 --> 01:48:18,058
LOVE TO HELP THAT PERSON AT 

3837
01:48:18,058 --> 01:48:20,827
THAT MOMENT, IS TO AS QUICKLY 

3838
01:48:20,827 --> 01:48:21,494
AS POSSIBLE GET TO THAT POINT 

3839
01:48:21,494 --> 01:48:23,797
WE CAN CONFRONT THIS PERSON AND 

3840
01:48:23,797 --> 01:48:24,330
ELIMINATE THE SITUATION. 

3841
01:48:24,330 --> 01:48:27,067
>> SO MANY DECISIONS THAT LAW 

3842
01:48:27,067 --> 01:48:28,168
ENFORCEMENT MAKES ARE SO 

3843
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:28,969
DIFFICULT AND THEY HAVE TO BE 

3844
01:48:28,969 --> 01:48:30,637
MADE IN A SPLIT SECOND. 

3845
01:48:30,637 --> 01:48:31,204
>> NO QUESTION. 

3846
01:48:31,204 --> 01:48:32,539
>> KNOWING THAT AT ANY TIME A 

3847
01:48:32,539 --> 01:48:34,541
SHOOTER COULD BE HIDING AND 

3848
01:48:34,541 --> 01:48:36,543
COULD BE TARGETING THEM. 

3849
01:48:36,543 --> 01:48:38,445
TO RECAP FOR OUR VIEWERS WHEN 

3850
01:48:38,445 --> 01:48:40,180
WE KNOW, THESE ARE -- WHAT WE 

3851
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:43,316
KNOW, THESE ARE PICTURES FROM 

3852
01:48:43,316 --> 01:48:44,184
ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND. 

3853
01:48:44,184 --> 01:48:46,553
THIS IS AT THE CAPITAL GAZETTE 

3854
01:48:46,553 --> 01:48:47,253
BUILDING IN ANNAPOLIS. 

3855
01:48:47,253 --> 01:48:48,688
THIS IS A LOCAL NEWSPAPER OWNED 

3856
01:48:48,688 --> 01:48:50,056
BY THE BALTIMORE SUN WHERE 

3857
01:48:50,056 --> 01:48:53,460
THERE WAS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 

3858
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:53,993

3859
01:48:53,993 --> 01:48:56,162
POLICE NOW SAY THAT THE ACTIVE 

3860
01:48:56,162 --> 01:48:57,964
SHOOTER SITUATION IS OVER, THAT 

3861
01:48:57,964 --> 01:49:01,668
THE BUILDING HAS BEEN 

3862
01:49:01,668 --> 01:49:03,069
TACTICALLY CLEARED BUT IS NOT 

3863
01:49:03,069 --> 01:49:04,938
JET CLEARED FROM AN 

3864
01:49:04,938 --> 01:49:05,738
INVESTIGATORY STANDPOINT. 

3865
01:49:05,738 --> 01:49:06,740
SO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS, 

3866
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:07,841
POLICE OFFICERS, DETECTIVES ARE 

3867
01:49:07,841 --> 01:49:08,942

3868
01:49:08,942 --> 01:49:11,044
RIGHT NOW LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE, 

3869
01:49:11,044 --> 01:49:12,145
PUTTING EVIDENCE MARKERS DOWN 

3870
01:49:12,145 --> 01:49:14,848
NEXT TO WHERE THEY SEE SHELL 

3871
01:49:14,848 --> 01:49:16,016
CASINGS, BLOOD, ANYTHING THAT 

3872
01:49:16,016 --> 01:49:17,517
CAN HELP THEM PAINT THE PICTURE 

3873
01:49:17,517 --> 01:49:21,287
OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT 

3874
01:49:21,287 --> 01:49:21,955
BUILDING. 

3875
01:49:21,955 --> 01:49:25,959
WE ALSO HAVE FORMER ASSISTANT 

3876
01:49:25,959 --> 01:49:28,061
FBI DIRECTOR RON HOSKO AND CBS

01:49:29,763 --> 01:49:30,130
PHONE WITH US. 

3879
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:31,665
RON, WHAT'S YOUR ASSESSMENT AND 

3880
01:49:31,665 --> 01:49:32,465
GIVEN EVERYTHING YOU'VE HEARD 

3881
01:49:32,465 --> 01:49:34,100
SO FAR FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT, 

3882
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:35,168
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE? 

3883
01:49:36,269 --> 01:49:38,038
>> WELL, THIS IS NOT UNLIKE 

3884
01:49:38,038 --> 01:49:41,541
OTHER ACTIVE SHOOTER INCIDENTS 

3885
01:49:41,541 --> 01:49:44,744
WHERE I JUST HEARD A BRIEF PART 

3886
01:49:44,744 --> 01:49:48,648
OF YOUR PRIOR GUEST, THE LAW 

3887
01:49:48,648 --> 01:49:49,916
ENFORCEMENT HAS AN OPPORTUNITY 

3888
01:49:49,916 --> 01:49:53,386
HERE TO MOVE VERY QUICKLY. 

3889
01:49:53,386 --> 01:50:01,995
WE KNOW IN THEIR RESPONSE, 

3890
01:50:01,995 --> 01:50:02,962
THEIR TRAINING TO ACTIVE 

3891
01:50:02,962 --> 01:50:04,798
SHOOTER INCIDENTS IN THE PAST, 

3892
01:50:04,798 --> 01:50:05,899
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS 

3893
01:50:05,899 --> 01:50:07,867
ARE VERY LIKELY PATROL 

3894
01:50:07,867 --> 01:50:08,768
OFFICERS. 

3895
01:50:08,768 --> 01:50:10,003
OFTENTIMES TODAY THOSE PATROL 

3896
01:50:10,003 --> 01:50:11,137
OFFICERS HAVE PATROL RIFLES 

3897
01:50:11,137 --> 01:50:13,139
THAT THEY ARE TAKING INTO A 

3898
01:50:13,139 --> 01:50:13,873
SCENE WITH THEM. 

3899
01:50:13,873 --> 01:50:14,841
NOT EVERYONE HAS THAT. 

3900
01:50:14,841 --> 01:50:17,343
THEY HAVE TO MOVE VERY QUICKLY 

3901
01:50:17,343 --> 01:50:17,877
TO THE THREAT. 

3902
01:50:17,877 --> 01:50:22,382
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR AN 

3903
01:50:22,382 --> 01:50:24,717
OPPORTUNITY TO PAIR UP OR GET 

3904
01:50:24,717 --> 01:50:26,786
INTO A DIAMOND FORMATION WITH 

3905
01:50:26,786 --> 01:50:27,386
MULTIPLE OFFICERS THAT CAN 

3906
01:50:27,386 --> 01:50:29,089
REALLY SCAN FOR THE THREAT IN 

3907
01:50:29,089 --> 01:50:32,459
MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS AND MOVE 

3908
01:50:32,459 --> 01:50:33,826
VERY QUICKLY TO THAT THREAT. 

3909
01:50:33,826 --> 01:50:37,897
AS YOUR PRIOR GUEST MENTIONED, 

3910
01:50:37,897 --> 01:50:38,898
UNFORTUNATELY THAT DOESN'T GIVE 

3911
01:50:38,898 --> 01:50:40,800
THE FIRST RESPONDING OFFICERS 

3912
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,969
MUCH OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO TEND 

3913
01:50:42,969 --> 01:50:44,838
TO THE WOUNDED PEOPLE WHO MAY 

3914
01:50:44,838 --> 01:50:48,041
BE CRYING OUT FOR HELP WHO MAY 

3915
01:50:48,041 --> 01:50:48,541
BE GRIEVOUSLY WOUNDED. 

3916
01:50:48,541 --> 01:50:49,342
THEY HAVE TO MOVE PAST THEM 

3917
01:50:49,342 --> 01:50:50,610
BECAUSE THERE IS THE THREAT 

3918
01:50:50,610 --> 01:50:52,746
THAT THERE WILL BE MORE 

3919
01:50:52,746 --> 01:50:53,380
INJURIES, CERTAINLY THE THREAT 

3920
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:55,648
THAT THERE WILL BE INJURIES OR 

3921
01:50:55,648 --> 01:50:57,384
POTENTIALLY FATALITIES IN 

3922
01:50:57,384 --> 01:50:58,684
RETURN FIRE TOWARD THE POLICE, 

3923
01:50:58,684 --> 01:51:00,587
BUT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT 

3924
01:51:00,587 --> 01:51:03,123
THEY'RE GETTING INTO AND THEY 

3925
01:51:03,123 --> 01:51:04,758
MOVE VERY SYSTEMATICALLY TO THE 

3926
01:51:04,758 --> 01:51:06,292
SOUND OF THE GUNFIRE. 

3927
01:51:06,292 --> 01:51:08,595
úTHE GOAL 

3928
01:51:08,595 --> 01:51:11,998
THREAT AND THAT MEANS MOVING TO 

3929
01:51:11,998 --> 01:51:13,900
CONFRONT THE SHOOTER OR 

3930
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:14,768
SHOOTERS AS QUICKLY AS 

3931
01:51:14,768 --> 01:51:15,068
POSSIBLE. 

3932
01:51:15,068 --> 01:51:16,870
REALLY THE ONLY THING THAT 

3933
01:51:16,870 --> 01:51:18,838
COULD POTENTIALLY SLOW THEM 

3934
01:51:18,838 --> 01:51:20,874
DOWN IS OBVIOUSLY A RETURN 

3935
01:51:20,874 --> 01:51:22,976
GUNFIRE AT THEM OR THE THREAT 

3936
01:51:22,976 --> 01:51:25,945
OF AN IED, AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE, 

3937
01:51:25,945 --> 01:51:28,648
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO 

3938
01:51:28,648 --> 01:51:30,049
PRESENT POTENTIALLY EVEN A 

3939
01:51:30,049 --> 01:51:31,351
BIGGER THREAT TO RESPONDING LAW 

3940
01:51:31,351 --> 01:51:32,986
ENFORCEMENT AND THAT MAY BE AN 

3941
01:51:32,986 --> 01:51:35,488
EXPLOSIVE DEVICE THAT THEY HAVE 

3942
01:51:35,488 --> 01:51:36,890
TO ASSESS, MARK OFF AND SOMEHOW 

3943
01:51:36,890 --> 01:51:37,991
WORK THEIR WAY AROUND AS 

3944
01:51:37,991 --> 01:51:40,493
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET TO THE 

3945
01:51:40,493 --> 01:51:40,994
SHOOTER. 

3946
01:51:40,994 --> 01:51:43,263
AS YOU KNOW, OFTENTIMES THESE 

3947
01:51:43,263 --> 01:51:45,298
SHOOTERS ARE THINKING ABOUT 

3948
01:51:45,298 --> 01:51:47,801
SUICIDE IN THEIR FIRST 

3949
01:51:47,801 --> 01:51:48,301
CONFRONTATION WITH LAW 

3950
01:51:48,301 --> 01:51:50,503
ENFORCEMENT AND IN SOME 

3951
01:51:50,503 --> 01:51:52,372
OCCASIONS MOST ASSUREDLY 

3952
01:51:52,372 --> 01:51:53,139
THEY'RE NOT PERFECTLY ADEPT IN 

3953
01:51:53,139 --> 01:51:54,874
THE USE IN THE FIREARMS THEY 

3954
01:51:54,874 --> 01:51:57,443
BRING INTO THE SCENES. 

3955
01:51:57,443 --> 01:51:59,646
SO THEY MAY HAVE A JAM OF A 

3956
01:51:59,646 --> 01:52:00,947
WEAPON OR DROP MAGAZINES AND 

3957
01:52:00,947 --> 01:52:02,949
ALL OF A SUDDEN LAW ENFORCEMENT 

3958
01:52:02,949 --> 01:52:04,384
IS THERE AND NOW THEY HAVE A 

3959
01:52:04,384 --> 01:52:06,986
HARD CHOICE TO MAKE. 

3960
01:52:06,986 --> 01:52:09,622
DO I ENGAGE IN A FURTIVE MOTION 

3961
01:52:09,622 --> 01:52:11,691
AND BRING LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE 

3962
01:52:11,691 --> 01:52:15,128
TOWARDS ME AND END THIS WITH MY 

3963
01:52:15,128 --> 01:52:16,829
OWN DEATH BY POLICE? 

3964
01:52:16,829 --> 01:52:17,597
MANY OF THEM CONTEMPLATE 

3965
01:52:17,597 --> 01:52:20,300
SUICIDE OR THEY GO SUICIDE WHEN 

3966
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:21,334
THAT CONFRONTATION OCCURS. 

3967
01:52:22,502 --> 01:52:23,870
I THINK VERY OFTEN THESE FOLKS 

3968
01:52:23,870 --> 01:52:26,472
ARE THINKING OUT THEIR OPTIONS 

3969
01:52:26,472 --> 01:52:26,840
BEFOREHAND. 

3970
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:28,474
THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT WHO 

3971
01:52:28,474 --> 01:52:30,043
THEIR TARGETS ARE, HOW THEY'RE 

3972
01:52:30,043 --> 01:52:32,245
GOING TO GET IN, HOW THEY 

3973
01:52:32,245 --> 01:52:32,845
PRESUMABLY MIGHT ESCAPE IF 

3974
01:52:32,845 --> 01:52:34,080
THAT'S THEIR INTENT AND I THINK 

3975
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:37,350
SOME OF THEM REALIZE THAT MY 

3976
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:39,252
END WILL COME WHEN LAW 

3977
01:52:39,252 --> 01:52:39,752
ENFORCEMENT ARRIVES. 

3978
01:52:39,752 --> 01:52:40,687
>> RON, SOMETHING THAT YOU 

3979
01:52:40,687 --> 01:52:42,789
MENTIONED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL 

3980
01:52:42,789 --> 01:52:44,991
OF AN IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE 

3981
01:52:44,991 --> 01:52:49,195
DEVICE, THERE WAS A BOMB THREAT 

3982
01:52:49,195 --> 01:52:50,429
AND PAUL VIOLAS WHO IS SITTING 

3983
01:52:50,429 --> 01:52:52,398
TO MY LEFT HAS JUST LEARNED 

3984
01:52:52,398 --> 01:52:54,434
FROM HIS SOURCES THAT THAT BOMB 

3985
01:52:54,434 --> 01:52:55,502
THREAT HAS BEEN CLEARED. 

3986
01:52:55,502 --> 01:52:56,569
RON, BACK TO YOU, WE'VE 

3987
01:52:56,569 --> 01:52:59,572
REPORTED THAT THE SUSPECT USED 

3988
01:52:59,572 --> 01:53:01,541
A SHOTGUN AND ONE WITNESS SAID 

3989
01:53:01,541 --> 01:53:03,343
THAT HE FIRED THROUGH A GLASS 

3990
01:53:03,343 --> 01:53:03,576
DOOR. 

3991
01:53:03,576 --> 01:53:04,810
WHAT DOES THAT TELL US? 

3992
01:53:04,810 --> 01:53:07,080
>> WELL, HE WAS DETERMINED TO 

3993
01:53:07,080 --> 01:53:09,916
GET INTO HIS TARGETS, WHOEVER 

3994
01:53:09,916 --> 01:53:10,950
HIS TARGETS WERE. 

3995
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:12,619
HE HAD A DETERMINATION. 

3996
01:53:12,619 --> 01:53:13,019
LOOK. 

3997
01:53:13,019 --> 01:53:15,088
YOU DON'T GO INTO A BUSINESS IN 

3998
01:53:15,088 --> 01:53:17,290
A CITY IN AMERICA WITH A 

3999
01:53:17,290 --> 01:53:18,591
SHOTGUN FOR ANY REAL GOOD 

4000
01:53:18,591 --> 01:53:20,827
PURPOSE AT THIS POINT UNLESS 

4001
01:53:20,827 --> 01:53:22,495
YOU'RE LAW ENFORCEMENT. 

4002
01:53:22,495 --> 01:53:24,898
WE KNOW THAT OVER TIME KIND OF 

4003
01:53:24,898 --> 01:53:26,699
WHAT'S BEEN PERCEIVED AS THE 

4004
01:53:26,699 --> 01:53:30,103
ULTIMATE WEAPON HAS BEEN THE AR 

4005
01:53:30,103 --> 01:53:32,539
STYLE WEAPON, YOU KNOW, THAT 

4006
01:53:32,539 --> 01:53:36,176
CAN FIRE MANY ROUNDS, BUT A 

4007
01:53:36,176 --> 01:53:37,677
SHOTGUN IS IN MOST STATES, IF 

4008
01:53:37,677 --> 01:53:38,878
YOU DON'T HAVE A CRIMINAL 

4009
01:53:38,878 --> 01:53:41,047
RECORD OR SOME OTHER PROHIBITOR 

4010
01:53:41,047 --> 01:53:49,289
IN YOUR PAST, A SHOTGUN IS A 

4011
01:53:49,289 --> 01:53:52,692
COMMONLY USED HUNTING WEAPON 

4012
01:53:52,692 --> 01:53:54,961
ACROSS AMERICA, BUT A SHOTGUN 

4013
01:53:54,961 --> 01:53:56,429
CAN DO GREAT HARM. 

4014
01:53:56,429 --> 01:53:57,397
IN FACT, I'VE SEEN SOME WRITERS 

4015
01:53:57,397 --> 01:53:59,599
ARGUE THE CASE A SHOTGUN IS A 

4016
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:03,870
WORSE, MORE DEADLY WEAPON THAN 

4017
01:54:03,870 --> 01:54:08,875
AN AR15 STYLE WEAPON BECAUSE IF 

4018
01:54:08,875 --> 01:54:10,977
YOU'RE USING 00 BUCK 12 GAUGE 

4019
01:54:10,977 --> 01:54:14,314
SLUGS, YOU KNOW, WE'RE TALKING 

4020
01:54:14,314 --> 01:54:17,250
ABOUT A SOLID LEAD PROJECTILE 

4021
01:54:17,250 --> 01:54:21,187
THAT IS, YOU KNOW, 1/2 INCH IN 

4022
01:54:21,187 --> 01:54:24,791
DIAMETER, THAT IS A DEADLY 

4023
01:54:24,791 --> 01:54:27,093
WEAPON AND A 00 BUCK ROUND IS 

4024
01:54:27,093 --> 01:54:29,195
GOING TO SHOOT MULTIPLE SLUGS 

4025
01:54:29,195 --> 01:54:30,930
THAT ARE AROUND .32 CALIBER IN 

4026
01:54:30,930 --> 01:54:32,932
SIZE. 

4027
01:54:35,935 --> 01:54:39,305
THAT NUMBER OF HIGH SPEED LEAD 

4028
01:54:39,305 --> 01:54:39,906
PROJECTILES COMING AT YOU IS 

4029
01:54:39,906 --> 01:54:40,707
INTENDED TO KILL. 

4030
01:54:40,707 --> 01:54:42,608
PEOPLE DEER HUNT WITH THESE 

4031
01:54:42,608 --> 01:54:42,875
WEAPONS. 

4032
01:54:42,875 --> 01:54:44,510
IT IS INTENDED TO BRING DOWN A 

4033
01:54:44,510 --> 01:54:47,413
BIG ANIMAL AND SO A SHOTGUN IN 

4034
01:54:47,413 --> 01:54:50,216
THE RIGHT HANDS UNFORTUNATELY 

4035
01:54:50,216 --> 01:54:52,619
HERE IN THE WRONG HANDS, MOST 

4036
01:54:52,619 --> 01:54:55,254
SHOTGUNS TYPICALLY CARRY FIVE 

4037
01:54:55,254 --> 01:54:55,755
ROUNDS LOADED. 

4038
01:54:55,755 --> 01:54:58,057
THEY ARE VERY QUICK TO RELOAD. 

4039
01:54:58,057 --> 01:55:00,960
SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOT 

4040
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:02,061
OF PROJECTILES GOING DOWN RANGE 

4041
01:55:02,061 --> 01:55:05,531
AND DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF 

4042
01:55:05,531 --> 01:55:06,633
THE WEAPON, ANY LENGTH SHOTGUN, 

4043
01:55:06,633 --> 01:55:09,435
THE SHORTER IT IS, THE MORE 

4044
01:55:09,435 --> 01:55:13,006
QUICKLY THOSE -- LET'S SAY IT 

4045
01:55:13,006 --> 01:55:14,173
IS 12 GAUGE BUCKSHOT. 

4046
01:55:14,173 --> 01:55:15,708
THOSE PELLETS ARE GOING TO FAN 

4047
01:55:15,708 --> 01:55:18,811
OUT INTO A VERY WIDE PATTERN 

4048
01:55:18,811 --> 01:55:19,244
RELATIVELY QUICKLY. 

4049
01:55:19,244 --> 01:55:20,213
SO IF YOU'RE SHOOTING AT 

4050
01:55:20,213 --> 01:55:21,915
SOMEONE DOWN THE END OF A 

4051
01:55:21,915 --> 01:55:23,216
HALLWAY, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A 

4052
01:55:23,216 --> 01:55:24,417
SPREAD ON THOSE ROUNDS AND 

4053
01:55:24,417 --> 01:55:26,019
YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO 

4054
01:55:26,019 --> 01:55:27,654
POTENTIALLY TAKE DOWN MULTIPLE 

4055
01:55:27,654 --> 01:55:29,255
TARGETS AT THE SAME TIME. 

4056
01:55:31,457 --> 01:55:32,959
THESE ARE VERY DANGEROUS 

4057
01:55:32,959 --> 01:55:35,862
WEAPONS, BUT MOST COMMONLY ARE 

4058
01:55:35,862 --> 01:55:38,164
USED FOR SPORTING, FOR HUNTING, 

4059
01:55:38,164 --> 01:55:41,134
NOT USED IN THIS WAY. 

4060
01:55:41,134 --> 01:55:43,369
HERE SOMEONE WHO WAS A TWISTED 

4061
01:55:43,369 --> 01:55:45,705
SOUL HAD A DEADLIER PURPOSE IN 

4062
01:55:45,705 --> 01:55:46,039

YOU AND WHAT DOES THAT TELL

01:57:38,417 --> 01:57:39,118
YOU? 

4130
01:57:40,553 --> 01:57:42,288
>> WELL, LOOK, THIS IS IN A 

4131
01:57:42,288 --> 01:57:44,957
CITY LIKE THE SIZE OF ANNAPOLIS 

4132
01:57:44,957 --> 01:57:47,660
OR IN A MAJOR CITY AROUND THE 

4133
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:49,595
COUNTRY, NOT THAT ANNAPOLIS IS 

4134
01:57:49,595 --> 01:57:51,998
THAT BIG, THIS IS THE 

4135
01:57:51,998 --> 01:57:53,466
EXPECTATION OF THE AMERICAN 

4136
01:57:53,466 --> 01:57:56,302
PATROL OFFICER, THAT YOU GET A 

4137
01:57:56,302 --> 01:57:58,337
CALL LIKE THIS. 

4138
01:57:58,337 --> 01:58:00,006
IT IS THE WORST CALL IMAGINABLE 

4139
01:58:00,006 --> 01:58:01,941
AND YOU'RE EXPECTED TO GET TO 

4140
01:58:01,941 --> 01:58:03,809
THAT SCENE AS QUICKLY AS 

4141
01:58:03,809 --> 01:58:05,812
POSSIBLE, MAKE SENSE OF IT AS 

4142
01:58:05,812 --> 01:58:08,214
BEST YOU CAN, IDENTIFY THE 

4143
01:58:08,214 --> 01:58:09,315
THREAT AND MOVE TOWARDS IT 

4144
01:58:09,315 --> 01:58:12,752
KNOWING THAT THIS COULD BE YOUR 

4145
01:58:12,752 --> 01:58:15,555
LAST DAY IN THAT POSITION 

4146
01:58:15,555 --> 01:58:15,721
YOURSELF. 

4147
01:58:16,488 --> 01:58:19,959
THIS IS THE UNFORTUNATE REALITY 

4148
01:58:19,959 --> 01:58:24,330
OF SICK PEOPLE, OF WEAPONS IN 

4149
01:58:24,330 --> 01:58:26,132
AMERICA, OF ANGER PERHAPS. 

4150
01:58:26,132 --> 01:58:27,767
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ULTIMATE 

4151
01:58:27,767 --> 01:58:30,069
MOTIVATION HERE WAS. 

4152
01:58:30,069 --> 01:58:30,503
WAS IT ANTI-MEDIA? 

4153
01:58:30,503 --> 01:58:31,938
WAS IT REALLY A WORKPLACE 

4154
01:58:31,938 --> 01:58:33,840
VIOLENCE SITUATION WHERE YOU 

4155
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:36,776
HAD A DISAFFECTED EMPLOYE, 

4156
01:58:36,776 --> 01:58:40,046
SOMEBODY WHO WAS TERMINATED 

4157
01:58:40,046 --> 01:58:40,313
RECENTLY? 

4158
01:58:40,313 --> 01:58:41,147
TODAY PERHAPS WE'LL HAVE SOME 

4159
01:58:41,147 --> 01:58:42,815
SENSE OF MOTIVATION IN HOURS OR 

4160
01:58:42,815 --> 01:58:43,749
CERTAINLY BY TOMORROW WE'LL 

4161
01:58:43,749 --> 01:58:45,117
PROBABLY HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF 

4162
01:58:45,117 --> 01:58:47,286
WHO THIS PERSON WAS, WHAT THEIR 

4163
01:58:47,286 --> 01:58:48,554
HISTORY WAS, BUT THIS IS THE 

4164
01:58:48,554 --> 01:58:50,456
SAD REALITY IN AMERICA TODAY 

4165
01:58:50,456 --> 01:58:52,158
WHERE THESE INCIDENTS SEEM TO 

4166
01:58:52,158 --> 01:58:54,560
BE COMING AND ACCORDING TO FBI 

4167
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:59,665
STUDIES THEY ARE COMING WITH 

4168
01:58:59,665 --> 01:59:00,198
INCREASING FREQUENCY AND 

4169
01:59:00,198 --> 01:59:00,799
UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE PROBABLY 

4170
01:59:00,799 --> 01:59:05,971
GOING TO HEAR MORE OF THESE. 

4171
01:59:05,971 --> 01:59:11,210
THOSE COMMENTS BY THAT 

4172
01:59:11,210 --> 01:59:12,545
NEWSPAPER MEDIA PERSON, AS YOU 

4173
01:59:12,545 --> 01:59:15,047
WERE READING THEM, IT STRUCK ME 

4174
01:59:15,047 --> 01:59:15,848
THE PARALLELS BETWEEN WHAT 

4175
01:59:15,848 --> 01:59:17,316
THESE REPORTERS ARE DOING AND 

4176
01:59:17,316 --> 01:59:20,653
WHAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE 

4177
01:59:20,653 --> 01:59:23,356
THAT CAME TO STOP THIS TRAGEDY 

4178
01:59:23,356 --> 01:59:27,660
TODAY DO EVERY DAY AS WELL, 

4179
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:29,395
LONG HOURS, LOW PAY, TRYING TO 

4180
01:59:29,395 --> 01:59:33,265
MAKE SENSE OF MADNESS IN THEIR 

4181
01:59:33,265 --> 01:59:33,999
COMMUNITIES, IN ONE CASE REPORT 

4182
01:59:33,999 --> 01:59:35,668
ON IT, IN THE OTHER CASE 

4183
01:59:35,668 --> 01:59:36,134
RESPOND TO IT. 

4184
01:59:36,134 --> 01:59:37,436
SO IT STRUCK ME HOW MANY 

4185
01:59:37,436 --> 01:59:39,939
úPARAL 

4186
01:59:39,939 --> 01:59:41,440
FOLKS WHO UNFORTUNATELY LOST 

4187
01:59:41,440 --> 01:59:43,242
THEIR LIVES TODAY AND THE 

4188
01:59:43,242 --> 01:59:45,945
RESCUERS THAT CAME TO THEIR AID 

4189
01:59:45,945 --> 01:59:46,078
TODAY. 

4190
01:59:47,279 --> 01:59:49,649
SO MANY PARALLELS THAT THEY 

4191
01:59:49,649 --> 01:59:50,016
HAVE. 

4192
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:51,250
>> SO MANY COURAGEOUS FIRST 

4193
01:59:51,250 --> 01:59:53,019
RESPONDERS WHO RAN INTO HARM'S 

4194
01:59:53,019 --> 01:59:55,554
WAY AND GOT THERE IN ABOUT A 

4195
01:59:55,554 --> 01:59:55,787
MINUTE. 

4196
01:59:55,787 --> 01:59:57,557
THEY PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE 

4197
01:59:57,557 --> 01:59:59,691
LINE TO TRY TO SAVE LIVES. 

4198
01:59:59,691 --> 02:00:01,761
WE CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MANY LIVES 

4199
02:00:01,761 --> 02:00:02,261
WERE SAVED HERE. 

4200
02:00:02,261 --> 02:00:04,163
WE KNOW FIVE PEOPLE ARE KILLED, 

4201
02:00:04,163 --> 02:00:05,364
BUT IF LAW ENFORCEMENT HADN'T 

4202
02:00:05,364 --> 02:00:07,266
ARRIVED SO QUICKLY, IT COULD 

4203
02:00:07,266 --> 02:00:07,666
HAVE BEEN MORE. 

4204
02:00:07,666 --> 02:00:08,968
RON, STAY ON THE LINE WITH US. 

4205
02:00:08,968 --> 02:00:10,836
I WANT TO BRING IN JANE 

4206
02:00:10,836 --> 02:00:12,638
SCHLEGEL, THE NEWS DIRECTOR 

4207
02:00:12,638 --> 02:00:13,739
WITH WNAV RADIO IN ANNAPOLIS 

4208
02:00:13,739 --> 02:00:15,341
AND SHE IS AT THE SCENE. 

4209
02:00:15,341 --> 02:00:17,176
JANE, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING RIGHT 

4210
02:00:17,176 --> 02:00:17,376
NOW? 

4211
02:00:17,376 --> 02:00:19,745
>> Reporter:  I SEE MANY, MANY 

4212
02:00:19,745 --> 02:00:21,847
CAMERAS LINED UP WITH NEWS 

4213
02:00:21,847 --> 02:00:24,116
ORGANIZATIONS FROM ALL ACROSS 

4214
02:00:24,116 --> 02:00:25,051
EVERY LEVEL OF MEDIA AND 

4215
02:00:25,051 --> 02:00:27,053
ENTERTAINMENT ACROSS THE REGION 

4216
02:00:27,053 --> 02:00:28,888
AND PROBABLY REACHING BEYOND. 

4217
02:00:28,888 --> 02:00:32,058
BESIDES THAT I SEE OUR TREE 

4218
02:00:32,058 --> 02:00:33,492
LINED STREETS WITH NOTHING BUT 

4219
02:00:33,492 --> 02:00:35,961
EMERGENCY RESPONDERS LINED UP 

4220
02:00:35,961 --> 02:00:36,528
AND THEIR LIGHTS FLASHING. 

4221
02:00:36,528 --> 02:00:41,167
THIS ROAD THAT WE'RE SITTING ON 

4222
02:00:41,167 --> 02:00:42,068
ACTUALLY TURNS INTO THE 

4223
02:00:42,068 --> 02:00:44,170
BOULEVARD WHICH IS THE GATEWAY 

4224
02:00:44,170 --> 02:00:46,138
INTO OUR HISTORIC CAPITAL CITY 

4225
02:00:46,138 --> 02:00:46,538
OF ANNAPOLIS. 

4226
02:00:46,538 --> 02:00:48,941
WE'RE WITHIN 2 MILES OF THE 

4227
02:00:48,941 --> 02:00:53,946
STATEHOUSE WHERE WE'RE LOCATED 

4228
02:00:53,946 --> 02:00:55,413
NEAR THE WESTFIELD ANNAPOLIS 

4229
02:00:55,413 --> 02:00:55,614
MALL. 

4230
02:00:55,614 --> 02:00:57,950
>> JANE, WHAT KIND OF A 

4231
02:00:57,950 --> 02:00:59,852
NEIGHBORHOOD IS THIS? 

4232
02:00:59,852 --> 02:01:00,986
IS THIS SOMEWHERE -- IT LOOKS 

4233
02:01:00,986 --> 02:01:04,390
FROM WHAT WE CAN SEE FROM THE 

4234
02:01:04,390 --> 02:01:05,891
HELICOPTER SHOT, THIS LOOKS 

4235
02:01:05,891 --> 02:01:07,659
LIKE A SUBURBAN AREA, A PRETTY 

4236
02:01:07,659 --> 02:01:08,060
QUIET AREA. 

4237
02:01:08,060 --> 02:01:09,462
>> Reporter:  IT GENERALLY IS. 

4238
02:01:09,462 --> 02:01:11,097
GENERALLY THE WORST THING THIS 

4239
02:01:11,097 --> 02:01:12,398
TIME OF DAY IS RUSH HOUR 

4240
02:01:12,398 --> 02:01:14,133
TRAFFIC WHERE IT DOES PICK UP 

4241
02:01:14,133 --> 02:01:16,334
BECAUSE WE HAVE A HUGE COMMUTER 

4242
02:01:16,334 --> 02:01:16,635
COMMUNITY. 

4243
02:01:16,635 --> 02:01:19,772
ANNAPOLIS IS THE CAPITAL CITY 

4244
02:01:19,772 --> 02:01:20,105
OF MARYLAND. 

4245
02:01:20,105 --> 02:01:22,675
WE'RE WITHIN HALF AN HOUR OF 

4246
02:01:22,675 --> 02:01:23,943
BALTIMORE, WITHIN HALF AN HOUR 

4247
02:01:23,943 --> 02:01:25,644
OF WASHINGTON D.C., BUT I CAN 

4248
02:01:25,644 --> 02:01:27,079
TELL YOU IN OUR LOCAL CRIME 

4249
02:01:27,079 --> 02:01:28,748
REPORT WHICH WE BROADCAST EVERY 

4250
02:01:28,748 --> 02:01:29,949
MORNING FROM THE ANNAPOLIS 

4251
02:01:29,949 --> 02:01:30,649
POLICE DEPARTMENT, WE STILL 

4252
02:01:30,649 --> 02:01:32,451
MAKE MENTION OF STOLEN BIKES. 

4253
02:01:32,451 --> 02:01:34,620
SO IF THAT GIVES YOU ANY KIND 

4254
02:01:34,620 --> 02:01:36,489
OF A CONCEPT OF OUR REALITY 

4255
02:01:36,489 --> 02:01:37,990
NORMALLY, THIS IS NOT IT. 

4256
02:01:39,592 --> 02:01:41,727
>> JANE, WAS THERE ANY OTHER 

4257
02:01:41,727 --> 02:01:42,361
INFORMATION YOU WERE ABLE TO 

4258
02:01:42,361 --> 02:01:44,397
GLEAN FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT 

4259
02:01:44,397 --> 02:01:44,630
THERE? 

4260
02:01:44,630 --> 02:01:47,900
I KNOW THAT THEY GAVE TWO PRESS 

4261
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:49,402
BRIEFINGS SO FAR. 

4262
02:01:49,402 --> 02:01:51,470
THERE WASN'T MUCH INFORMATION 

4263
02:01:51,470 --> 02:01:52,872
THAT WE HADN'T ALREADY HEARD. 

4264
02:01:52,872 --> 02:01:54,707
ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU'VE BEEN 

4265
02:01:54,707 --> 02:01:57,877
ABLE TO GATHER FROM EITHER LAW 

4266
02:01:57,877 --> 02:01:58,610
ENFORCEMENT OR WITNESSES YOU'VE 

4267
02:01:58,610 --> 02:01:59,578
BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK WITH? 

4268
02:01:59,578 --> 02:02:00,579
>> Reporter:  WE KNOW THAT 

4269
02:02:00,579 --> 02:02:02,681
THERE ARE FIVE FATALITIES. 

4270
02:02:02,681 --> 02:02:04,349
THERE ARE ADDITIONAL INJURIES. 

4271
02:02:04,349 --> 02:02:06,085
THEY HAVE SET UP A 

4272
02:02:06,085 --> 02:02:07,787
REUNIFICATION FOR FAMILY AND 

4273
02:02:07,787 --> 02:02:11,924
FRIENDS AT THE MALL THAT YOU 

4274
02:02:11,924 --> 02:02:13,959
CAN PROBABLY SEE, THE WESTFIELD 

4275
02:02:13,959 --> 02:02:14,326
ANNAPOLIS MALL. 

4276
02:02:14,326 --> 02:02:15,795
ONE THING YOU MAY NOT HAVE 

4277
02:02:15,795 --> 02:02:18,197
HEARD IS FROM OUR MAYOR GAVIN 

4278
02:02:18,197 --> 02:02:18,463
BUCKLEY. 

4279
02:02:18,463 --> 02:02:20,066
JUST LAST WEEK ON THURSDAY THEY 

4280
02:02:20,066 --> 02:02:21,901
COMPLETED AN ACTIVE ASSAILANT 

4281
02:02:21,901 --> 02:02:24,370
EXERCISE AT A LOCAL SCHOOL 

4282
02:02:24,370 --> 02:02:27,473
CAMPUS FOR THIS EXACT TYPE OF 

4283
02:02:27,473 --> 02:02:28,274
RESPONSE NEVER IMAGINING THAT 

4284
02:02:28,274 --> 02:02:30,910
WITHIN A FEW DAYS LATER WE'D BE 

4285
02:02:30,910 --> 02:02:32,578
TALKING ABOUT REAL FATALITIES. 

4286
02:02:32,578 --> 02:02:34,180
>> IS THIS WITH THE SAME POLICE 

4287
02:02:34,180 --> 02:02:36,549
FORCE THAT RESPONDED TO THIS 

4288
02:02:36,549 --> 02:02:36,949
SITUATION TODAY? 

4289
02:02:36,949 --> 02:02:37,817
>> Reporter:  THIS IS ONE OF 

4290
02:02:37,817 --> 02:02:39,484
THE MANY POLICE FORCES. 

4291
02:02:39,484 --> 02:02:44,390
THIS ROAD ACTUALLY IS ON THE 

4292
02:02:44,390 --> 02:02:50,796
CITY OF ANNAPOLIS AND COUNTY, 

4293
02:02:50,796 --> 02:02:52,198
ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY POLICE 

4294
02:02:52,198 --> 02:02:53,966
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE PRIMARY 

4295
02:02:53,966 --> 02:02:56,001
RESPONSE UNIT WITH THE 

4296
02:02:56,001 --> 02:02:57,203
ANNAPOLIS POLICE LITERALLY 

4297
02:02:57,203 --> 02:02:57,636
RIGHT BEHIND THEM. 

4298
02:02:57,636 --> 02:03:01,173
THEN WE'VE SEEN AGENCIES 

4299
02:03:01,173 --> 02:03:01,440
INVOLVED. 

4300
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:03,275
I'VE BEEN TOLD 10 PLUS AGENCIES 

4301
02:03:03,275 --> 02:03:05,478
TO INCLUDE THE FBI, ATF AND 

4302
02:03:05,478 --> 02:03:06,144
OTHERS ARE INVOLVED. 

4303
02:03:06,144 --> 02:03:07,580
FROM WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD, IT 

4304
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:09,081
MAY HAVE BEEN A LONG GUN. 

4305
02:03:09,081 --> 02:03:10,082
THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS AN 

4306
02:03:10,082 --> 02:03:11,250
ASSAULT WEAPON THAT WAS USED 

4307
02:03:11,250 --> 02:03:15,621
AND AGAIN THERE ARE -- THEY ARE 

4308
02:03:15,621 --> 02:03:16,422
NOW ACTIVELY INTERVIEWING THE 

4309
02:03:16,422 --> 02:03:17,957
ONE AND THEY BELIEVE THE ONLY 

4310
02:03:17,957 --> 02:03:19,425
SUSPECT THIS HOUR. 

4311
02:03:19,425 --> 02:03:22,161
>> JANE, FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE 

4312
02:03:22,161 --> 02:03:23,095
COVERING CRIME IN THIS AREA IT 

4313
02:03:23,095 --> 02:03:25,831
SEEMS GIVEN THE FACT THERE WAS 

4314
02:03:25,831 --> 02:03:26,899
AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SCENARIO JUST 

4315
02:03:26,899 --> 02:03:28,100
RECENTLY THAT THIS WAS 

4316
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:30,603
SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY ON 

4317
02:03:30,603 --> 02:03:32,371
THE MINDS OF LOCAL OFFICIALS. 

4318
02:03:32,371 --> 02:03:33,539
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT 

4319
02:03:33,539 --> 02:03:34,373
COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAD BEEN 

4320
02:03:34,373 --> 02:03:35,775
WORRIED ABOUT THAT THIS COULD 

4321
02:03:35,775 --> 02:03:37,176
HAPPEN IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD? 

4322
02:03:37,476 --> 02:03:38,677
>> Reporte:  I THINK THAT 

4323
02:03:38,677 --> 02:03:39,879
EVERY COMMUNITY HAS TO WORRY 

4324
02:03:39,879 --> 02:03:42,448
THAT THIS CAN HAPPEN IN THEIR 

4325
02:03:42,448 --> 02:03:43,782
OWN BACKYARD BASED ON WHAT 

4326
02:03:43,782 --> 02:03:45,084
WE'VE SEEN HAPPEN IN RECENT 

4327
02:03:45,084 --> 02:03:47,186
MONTHS IN, RECENT YEARS AND 

4328
02:03:47,186 --> 02:03:49,054
THESQUE -- MONTHS, IN RECENT 

4329
02:03:49,054 --> 02:03:50,723
YEARS AND THE ESCALATING 

4330
02:03:50,723 --> 02:03:51,290
VIOLENCE, PEOPLE VIOLENCE. 

4331
02:03:51,290 --> 02:03:53,125
I'M NOT SURE WE CAN BLAME IT ON 

4332
02:03:53,125 --> 02:03:54,026
THE GUNS ANYMORE, BUT WE'VE GOT 

4333
02:03:54,026 --> 02:03:55,961
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON 

4334
02:03:55,961 --> 02:03:56,428
WITH OUR PEOPLE. 

4335
02:03:56,428 --> 02:03:57,963
>> JANE SCHLEGEL, THANK YOU SO 

4336
02:03:57,963 --> 02:03:58,997
MUCH FOR JOINING US. 

4337
02:03:58,997 --> 02:04:01,133
WE'RE GOING BACK TO RON HOSKO, 

4338
02:04:01,133 --> 02:04:02,601
THE FORMER ASSISTANT FBI 

4339
02:04:02,601 --> 02:04:03,903
DIRECTOR AND CBS NEWS SECURITY 

4340
02:04:03,903 --> 02:04:05,271
ANALYST WHO IS ON THE PHONE 

4341
02:04:05,271 --> 02:04:05,805
WITH US. 

4342
02:04:05,805 --> 02:04:09,074
RON, WE'VE JUST LEARNED FROM A 

4343
02:04:09,074 --> 02:04:09,975
SENIOR FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT 

4344
02:04:09,975 --> 02:04:12,678
OFFICER THAT THE SUSPECT HAD 

4345
02:04:12,678 --> 02:04:13,045
FAKE GRENADES. 

4346
02:04:13,045 --> 02:04:14,213
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? 

4347
02:04:16,081 --> 02:04:19,919
>> WELL, WHETHER HE WAS LOOKING 

4348
02:04:19,919 --> 02:04:23,422
TO USE DEVICES, WHETHER IT WAS 

4349
02:04:23,422 --> 02:04:25,090
SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING TO 

4350
02:04:25,090 --> 02:04:26,592
SOUND LIKE AN EXPLOSION OR MORE 

4351
02:04:26,592 --> 02:04:29,028
LIKELY SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING 

4352
02:04:29,028 --> 02:04:29,428
TO EMIT SMOKE. 

4353
02:04:29,428 --> 02:04:33,132
WAS HE GOING TO DO THAT IN A 

4354
02:04:33,132 --> 02:04:37,603
WAY TO COVER HIS EGRESS, HIS 

4355
02:04:37,603 --> 02:04:38,003
POTENTIAL ESCAPE? 

4356
02:04:38,003 --> 02:04:40,405
WAS HE GOING TO DO IT TO CREATE 

4357
02:04:40,405 --> 02:04:41,674
ADDITIONAL CONFUSION TO DEFEAT 

4358
02:04:41,674 --> 02:04:43,075
LAW ENFORCEMENT'S EFFORTS TO 

4359
02:04:43,075 --> 02:04:44,109
LOCATE HIM WITHIN THE BUILDING? 

4360
02:04:45,945 --> 02:04:48,480
HOPEFULLY WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT 

4361
02:04:48,480 --> 02:04:51,784
DOES HEAR HIS SIDE OF THE 

4362
02:04:51,784 --> 02:04:54,219
STORY, HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE 

4363
02:04:54,219 --> 02:04:57,423
ABLE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH 

4364
02:04:57,423 --> 02:04:59,191
HIM AND UNDERSTAND IT AND 

4365
02:04:59,191 --> 02:05:01,694
EXPLOIT HIS DEVICES WHETHER 

4366
02:05:01,694 --> 02:05:02,660
IT'S COMPUTER, SOCIAL MEDIA, 

4367
02:05:02,660 --> 02:05:04,430
THAT THEY'LL GET A BETTER 

4368
02:05:04,430 --> 02:05:05,731
UNDERSTANDING OF HIS DRIVERS 

4369
02:05:05,731 --> 02:05:07,732
HERE, BUT IT COULD BE ANY OF 

4370
02:05:07,732 --> 02:05:08,567
THOSE THINGS. 

4371
02:05:10,035 --> 02:05:11,103
I THINK, AS I MENTIONED 

4372
02:05:11,103 --> 02:05:13,304
EARLIER, IF SOMEONE WERE TO 

4373
02:05:13,304 --> 02:05:17,509
BRING A DEVICE IN, THAT'S GOING 

4374
02:05:17,509 --> 02:05:21,113
TO AUTOMATICALLY HAVE LAW 

4375
02:05:21,113 --> 02:05:23,082
ENFORCEMENT DOUBLE THEIR 

4376
02:05:23,082 --> 02:05:24,783
WARINESS OF WHERE THEY GO, OF 

4377
02:05:24,783 --> 02:05:26,652
HOW THEY GO THERE, HOW QUICKLY 

4378
02:05:26,652 --> 02:05:28,721
THEY GO THERE BECAUSE SUDDENLY 

4379
02:05:28,721 --> 02:05:32,024
YOU HAVE TO ASSESS IS THERE A 

4380
02:05:32,024 --> 02:05:33,325
TRAP LAID FOR US THAT WILL TAKE 

4381
02:05:33,325 --> 02:05:43,302
DOWN MANY OF THE RESCUERS, 

4382
02:05:43,302 --> 02:05:44,703
BASICALLY HARM THE LAW 

4383
02:05:44,703 --> 02:05:45,771
ENFORCEMENT RESCUERS COMING IN? 

4384
02:05:45,771 --> 02:05:47,172
SO THAT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS 

4385
02:05:47,172 --> 02:05:48,474
THAT WILL SLOW DOWN A LAW 

4386
02:05:48,474 --> 02:05:49,875
ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE TO AN 

4387
02:05:49,875 --> 02:05:50,342
ACTIVE SHOOTER HERE. 

4388
02:05:50,342 --> 02:05:51,677
SO IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING 

4389
02:05:51,677 --> 02:05:51,843
AS. 

4390
02:05:51,843 --> 02:05:53,712
>>> AS THAT, MAYBE JUST TO 

4391
02:05:53,712 --> 02:05:55,281
CREATE SOME -- AS SIMPLE AS 

4392
02:05:55,281 --> 02:05:57,383
THAT, MAYBE JUST TO CREATE SOME 

4393
02:05:57,383 --> 02:05:58,017
ADDITIONAL CONFUSION, BUY SOME 

4394
02:05:58,017 --> 02:05:59,585
TIME OR COVER AN ESCAPE. 

4395
02:05:59,585 --> 02:06:01,120
>> IT SEEMS SOMETHING LIKE 

4396
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:02,521
THESE FAKE GRENADES WOULD BE 

4397
02:06:02,521 --> 02:06:05,424
LIKE A FLASH BANG THAT WOULD 

4398
02:06:05,424 --> 02:06:06,057
CREATE CONFUSION, SMOKE, CHAOS 

4399
02:06:06,057 --> 02:06:07,359
WHERE THERE UNFORTUNATELY WAS 

4400
02:06:07,359 --> 02:06:08,827
PLENTY OF CHAOS. 

4401
02:06:08,827 --> 02:06:09,728
RON, EARLIER YOU MENTIONED 

4402
02:06:09,728 --> 02:06:14,333
THERE HAVE BEEN FBI STUDIES ON 

4403
02:06:14,333 --> 02:06:14,933
THESE SHOOTINGS. 

4404
02:06:14,933 --> 02:06:17,503
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED FROM 

4405
02:06:17,503 --> 02:06:17,870
THESE STUDIES? 

4406
02:06:17,870 --> 02:06:19,638
WHAT PATTERNS ARE YOU SEEING? 

4407
02:06:19,638 --> 02:06:23,475
>> WELL, FIRST THERE WAS ONE  

4408
02:06:23,475 --> 02:06:24,610
THAT JUST CAME OUT VERY 

4409
02:06:24,610 --> 02:06:27,279
RECENTLY WHERE THE FBI AND 

4410
02:06:27,279 --> 02:06:29,014
OTHERS ARE LOOKING AT WHAT'S IN 

4411
02:06:29,014 --> 02:06:31,216
THE MINDS OF THESE MORE RECENT 

4412
02:06:31,216 --> 02:06:31,983
ACTIVE SHOOTERS? 

4413
02:06:34,853 --> 02:06:35,520
THEIR STUDIES CERTAINLY SHOW AN 

4414
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,322
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER, THE 

4415
02:06:37,322 --> 02:06:40,892
FREQUENCY OF ACTIVE SHOOTING 

4416
02:06:40,892 --> 02:06:41,126
EVENTS. 

4417
02:06:41,126 --> 02:06:42,528
10 OR 15 YEARS AGO YOU MIGHT BE 

4418
02:06:42,528 --> 02:06:48,734
TALKING ABOUT A HANDFUL OF 

4419
02:06:48,734 --> 02:06:50,035
THESE PER YEAR, MAYBE FEWER 

4420
02:06:50,035 --> 02:06:52,104
THAN 10 AND NOW I THINK WE'RE 

4421
02:06:52,104 --> 02:06:53,605
TALKING MULTIPLES OF THAT. 

4422
02:06:53,605 --> 02:06:54,807
THEY'RE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO 

4423
02:06:54,807 --> 02:06:57,409
EVALUATE AND COMPARE IN KIND OF 

4424
02:06:57,409 --> 02:07:01,013
A CROSS-CUTTING WAY A STUDY OF 

4425
02:07:01,013 --> 02:07:03,716
MULTIPLE OFFENDERS TO LOOK FOR 

4426
02:07:03,716 --> 02:07:04,283
COMMONALITIES, TO LOOK FOR 

4427
02:07:04,283 --> 02:07:05,217
TRENDS. 

4428
02:07:05,217 --> 02:07:06,719
WE'VE SEEN THE TREND OF MENTAL 

4429
02:07:06,719 --> 02:07:09,955
ILLNESS THAT TRACKS THROUGH SO 

4430
02:07:09,955 --> 02:07:18,330
MANY OF THESE FOLKS, JARED 

4431
02:07:18,330 --> 02:07:20,599
LOUGHNER AND IN THE AURORA 

4432
02:07:20,599 --> 02:07:21,634
SHOOTING, AARON ALEXIS AT THE 

4433
02:07:21,634 --> 02:07:23,936
WASHINGTON NAVY YARD AND OTHERS 

4434
02:07:23,936 --> 02:07:24,936
WHO WERE ACTIVELY MENTALLY ILL. 

4435
02:07:24,936 --> 02:07:26,505
YOU COULD SEE IT AS SOON AS YOU 

4436
02:07:26,505 --> 02:07:28,407
SAW THE PICTURES OF THEM IN 

4437
02:07:28,407 --> 02:07:30,509
CUSTODY THAT THIS WAS SOMEBODY 

4438
02:07:30,509 --> 02:07:31,510
WHO IS SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL 

4439
02:07:31,510 --> 02:07:33,879
OR WHEN THEY TALKED TO THE 

4440
02:07:33,879 --> 02:07:35,314
FIRST RELATIVE, THEY KNEW THIS 

4441
02:07:35,314 --> 02:07:36,948
WAS MENTAL ILLNESS, BUT THERE 

4442
02:07:36,948 --> 02:07:38,183
ARE OTHERS, TOO. 

4443
02:07:38,183 --> 02:07:39,818
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ANGRY 

4444
02:07:39,818 --> 02:07:43,188
OUT THERE, WHO ARE DISAFFECTED. 

4445
02:07:43,188 --> 02:07:45,457
WE SAW IT IN FLORIDA, THAT YOU 

4446
02:07:45,457 --> 02:07:46,925
JUST HAVE SOMEBODY WHO OVER 

4447
02:07:46,925 --> 02:07:50,229
TIME APPEARS TO START TO BE 

4448
02:07:50,229 --> 02:07:52,231
SOCIOPATHIC AND THERE IS A LONG 

4449
02:07:52,231 --> 02:07:54,733
TREND AND A LONG WARM-UP, MAYBE 

4450
02:07:54,733 --> 02:07:56,802
WEEKS LONG OR LONGER AS THEY 

4451
02:07:56,802 --> 02:07:58,504
STUDY THEIR TARGET, AS THEY 

4452
02:07:58,504 --> 02:08:02,540
CONTEMPLATE WHO THEIR  TARGETS 

4453
02:08:02,540 --> 02:08:03,408
ARE GOING TO BE. 

4454
02:08:03,408 --> 02:08:12,050
SO THERE IS CERTAINLY NO ONE 

4455
02:08:12,050 --> 02:08:17,256
PERSON. 

4456
02:08:17,256 --> 02:08:19,758
OR DESCRIPTOR OF AN ACTIVE 

4457
02:08:19,758 --> 02:08:22,427
SHOOTER -- NO ONE PERSON OR 

4458
02:08:22,427 --> 02:08:23,227
DESCRIPTOR OF AN ACTIVE 

4459
02:08:23,227 --> 02:08:23,494
SHOOTER. 

4460
02:08:23,494 --> 02:08:24,930
THAT'S WHY WE KEEP HEARING FROM 

4461
02:08:24,930 --> 02:08:26,532
LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE ARE 

4462
02:08:26,532 --> 02:08:26,765
SIGNS. 

4463
02:08:26,765 --> 02:08:28,233
FOR THOSE AROUND THESE PEOPLE 

4464
02:08:28,233 --> 02:08:28,633
THERE ARE SIGNS. 

4465
02:08:28,633 --> 02:08:35,574
WE SAW IT, OF COURSE, IN THE 

4466
02:08:35,574 --> 02:08:36,040
FLORIDA SHOOTING. 

4467
02:08:36,040 --> 02:08:38,277
IT'S COMMON IN SO MANY OF THESE 

4468
02:08:38,277 --> 02:08:38,577
SHOOTINGS. 

4469
02:08:38,577 --> 02:08:40,179
I THINK THE FBI'S ESTIMATES ARE 

4470
02:08:40,179 --> 02:08:43,081
AS MANY AS 80% OR EVEN HIGHER 

4471
02:08:43,081 --> 02:08:45,851
WHERE THERE ARE INDICATORS OF, 

4472
02:08:45,851 --> 02:08:48,887
YOU KNOW, NOT ONLY MENTAL 

4473
02:08:48,887 --> 02:08:51,757
ILLNESS, BUT GATHERING STEAM, 

4474
02:08:51,757 --> 02:08:52,991
GATHERING WEAPONS, STARTING TO 

4475
02:08:52,991 --> 02:08:53,558
CONTEMPLATE THEIR TARGETS, 

4476
02:08:53,558 --> 02:08:54,693
TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE IN A WAY 

4477
02:08:54,693 --> 02:08:57,396
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS A 

4478
02:08:57,396 --> 02:08:58,262
POTENTIAL ATTACKER. 

4479
02:08:58,262 --> 02:09:00,799
SO WE CONSTANTLY HEAR FROM LAW 

4480
02:09:00,799 --> 02:09:04,002
ENFORCEMENT THAT WE ALL HAVE A 

4481
02:09:04,002 --> 02:09:04,970
RESPONSIBILITY HERE AND THAT'S 

4482
02:09:04,970 --> 02:09:06,672
TO BE LOOKING OUT OVER OUR 

4483
02:09:06,672 --> 02:09:08,707
NEIGHBORS, OUR FRIENDS, OUR 

4484
02:09:08,707 --> 02:09:10,175
FAMILY MEMBERS AND SAYING LOOK, 

4485
02:09:10,175 --> 02:09:12,477
AM I IN CONTACT WITH SOMEBODY 

4486
02:09:12,477 --> 02:09:14,379
WHO LITERALLY IS TICKING, WHO 

4487
02:09:14,379 --> 02:09:16,782
IS FLASHING RED LIKE THE 

4488
02:09:16,782 --> 02:09:17,916
FLORIDA SHOOTER WAS? 

4489
02:09:17,916 --> 02:09:20,085
AND WHAT'S MY OBLIGATIONS? 

4490
02:09:20,085 --> 02:09:21,220
SOMEHOW TALK TO LAW 

4491
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:21,553
ENFORCEMENT. 

4492
02:09:21,553 --> 02:09:22,921
IN THAT CASE OBVIOUSLY LAW 

4493
02:09:22,921 --> 02:09:24,389
ENFORCEMENT FAILED ON MANY 

4494
02:09:24,389 --> 02:09:27,593
LEVELS, BUT IT IS THE GOAL TO 

4495
02:09:27,593 --> 02:09:28,794
SPOT THESE FOLKS BEFORE IT 

4496
02:09:28,794 --> 02:09:30,996
HAPPENS, SOMEHOW GET TO THEM 

4497
02:09:30,996 --> 02:09:33,966
WHETHER IT'S WITH AN ARREST FOR 

4498
02:09:33,966 --> 02:09:36,401
SOMETHING ELSE, WHETHER IT'S 

4499
02:09:36,401 --> 02:09:37,703
PSYCHOLOGICAL HELP, WHETHER 

4500
02:09:37,703 --> 02:09:39,171
IT'S HELPING A SCHOOL, HOW YOU 

4501
02:09:39,171 --> 02:09:42,040
HANDLE AN EMPLOYEE THAT YOU'RE 

4502
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:43,075
GOING TO TERMINATE AND TRY TO 

4503
02:09:43,075 --> 02:09:44,476
GET IN FRONT OF THESE EVENTS 

4504
02:09:44,476 --> 02:09:45,878
BEFORE THEY TURN OUT TRAGIC 

4505
02:09:45,878 --> 02:09:47,579
LIKE TODAY DID. 

4506
02:09:47,579 --> 02:09:49,481
>> THE RESPONSIBILITY FALLS ON 

4507
02:09:49,481 --> 02:09:49,714
US ALL. 

4508
02:09:49,714 --> 02:09:52,684
RON, THE SUSPECT REPORTEDLY HAS 

4509
02:09:52,684 --> 02:09:54,319
NOT BEEN COOPERATING WITH 

4510
02:09:54,319 --> 02:09:54,620
POLICE. 

4511
02:09:54,620 --> 02:09:55,888
WHAT WILL LAW ENFORCEMENT BE 

4512
02:09:55,888 --> 02:09:57,990
LOOKING FOR AS THEY TRY TO FIND 

4513
02:09:57,990 --> 02:10:00,826
OUT MORE ABOUT HIM? 

4514
02:10:00,826 --> 02:10:03,495
>> WELL, THEY BY NOW I WOULD 

4515
02:10:03,495 --> 02:10:05,964
THINK HAVE HIM FINGERPRINTED 

4516
02:10:05,964 --> 02:10:08,300
AND VERY LIKELY IDENTIFIED. 

4517
02:10:08,300 --> 02:10:10,002
VERY OFTEN THESE FOLKS HAVE A 

4518
02:10:10,002 --> 02:10:13,038
CRIMINAL HISTORY AND THERE ARE 

4519
02:10:13,038 --> 02:10:13,338
PLATFORMS. 

4520
02:10:13,338 --> 02:10:16,174
I KNOW THAT THE FBI USES THAT 

4521
02:10:16,174 --> 02:10:18,577
POLICE HAVE THAT CAN CAPTURE 

4522
02:10:18,577 --> 02:10:20,479
FINGERPRINTS DIGITALLY, RUN 

4523
02:10:20,479 --> 02:10:23,315
THEM OFF KNOWN DATABASES AND 

4524
02:10:23,315 --> 02:10:24,583
VERY LIKELY IDENTIFY SOMEONE IF 

4525
02:10:24,583 --> 02:10:26,084
THEY EVEN NEED TO DO THAT. 

4526
02:10:26,084 --> 02:10:27,919
IT COULD BE THIS IS A FORMER 

4527
02:10:27,919 --> 02:10:28,553
EMPLOYEE THERE, SOMEBODY FROM 

4528
02:10:28,553 --> 02:10:29,954
THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND PEOPLE 

4529
02:10:29,954 --> 02:10:31,189
KNOW WHO THIS IS. 

4530
02:10:31,189 --> 02:10:32,957
EVERY, BUT THEY ARE CERTAINLY 

4531
02:10:32,957 --> 02:10:34,827
GOING TO BE -- THIS IS, BUT 

4532
02:10:34,827 --> 02:10:37,062

FAMILY, CO-WORKERS AND TRYING 

4539
02:10:46,538 --> 02:10:50,576
TO PAINT A PICTURE WITHOUT HIS 

4540
02:10:50,576 --> 02:10:50,909
COOPERATION. 

4541
02:10:50,909 --> 02:10:51,276
IT COULD BE -- 

4542
02:10:51,276 --> 02:10:52,978
>> I'M GOING TO JUST JUMP IN 

4543
02:10:52,978 --> 02:10:53,278

4544
02:10:53,278 --> 02:10:54,546

02:11:07,058 --> 02:11:07,792
INVESTIGATION, SOME OF THE

02:11:07,792 --> 02:11:09,428

02:11:09,428 --> 02:11:10,628
WE'LL HAVE SOME ANSWERS FOR. 

4556
02:11:10,628 --> 02:11:11,530
UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL HAVE 

4557
02:11:11,530 --> 02:11:13,298
SOME THAT WE CAN'T ANSWER, BUT 

4558
02:11:13,298 --> 02:11:14,633
WE DO HAVE AN UPDATE. 

4559
02:11:14,633 --> 02:11:18,970
WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER. 

4560
02:11:18,970 --> 02:11:21,873
>> I'M COUNTY EXECUTIVE STEVE 

4561
02:11:21,873 --> 02:11:22,073
SCHU. 

4562
02:11:22,073 --> 02:11:23,475
AS WE REPORTED EARLIER TODAY, 

4563
02:11:23,475 --> 02:11:25,944
THERE'S BEEN A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY 

4564
02:11:25,944 --> 02:11:31,883
HERE IN ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY. 

4565
02:11:31,883 --> 02:11:33,385
THERE WAS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 

4566
02:11:33,385 --> 02:11:33,685
INCIDENT. 

4567
02:11:33,685 --> 02:11:35,721
FIVE PEOPLE ARE DEAD. 

4568
02:11:35,721 --> 02:11:36,922
SEVERAL MORE ARE WOUNDED IN 

4569
02:11:36,922 --> 02:11:37,122
CARE. 

4570
02:11:37,122 --> 02:11:39,024
THE SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY BEING 

4571
02:11:39,024 --> 02:11:41,626
INTERROGATED AS WE SPEAK. 

4572
02:11:41,626 --> 02:11:43,428
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE 

4573
02:11:43,428 --> 02:11:45,964
TREMENDOUS WORK OF OUR PUBLIC 

4574
02:11:45,964 --> 02:11:48,033
SAFETY PROFESSIONALS TODAY, 

4575
02:11:48,033 --> 02:11:48,934
PARTICULARLY THE ANNE ARUNDEL

POLICE DEPARTMENT, THE 

4577
02:11:49,434 --> 02:11:51,903
ANNAPOLIS CITY POLICE 

4578
02:11:51,903 --> 02:11:52,804
DEPARTMENT AND THE ANNE ARUNDEL 

4579
02:11:52,804 --> 02:11:53,204
SHERIFF'S OFFICE. 

4580
02:11:53,204 --> 02:11:54,940
THEY WERE ON THE SCENE IN ABOUT 

4581
02:11:54,940 --> 02:11:56,975
60 SECONDS, BUT BEYOND THAT 

4582
02:11:56,975 --> 02:11:59,878
THEY WENT IMMEDIATELY INTO THAT 

4583
02:11:59,878 --> 02:12:01,480
BUILDING WITHOUT A MOMENT'S 

4584
02:12:01,480 --> 02:12:02,180
HESITATION AND DEMONSTRATED 

4585
02:12:02,180 --> 02:12:03,982
INCREDIBLE COURAGE AND WE ARE 

4586
02:12:03,982 --> 02:12:04,983
SO DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE OF THEIR 

4587
02:12:04,983 --> 02:12:05,283
GREAT WORK. 

4588
02:12:05,283 --> 02:12:08,220
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE. 

4589
02:12:08,220 --> 02:12:08,486
GOVERNOR HOGAN. 

4590
02:12:09,021 --> 02:12:10,622
>> WELL, I WANT TO THANK YOU 

4591
02:12:10,622 --> 02:12:12,524
ALL FOR BEING HERE. 

4592
02:12:12,524 --> 02:12:13,926
OBVIOUSLY OUR HEART GOES OUT TO 

4593
02:12:13,926 --> 02:12:15,026
THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES 

4594
02:12:15,026 --> 02:12:19,631
AND I JUST WANT TO REITERATE, 

4595
02:12:19,631 --> 02:12:21,733
IT'S ALL THREE COUNTY AGENCIES, 

4596
02:12:21,733 --> 02:12:22,935
THE CITY POLICE FORCE, COUNTY 

4597
02:12:22,935 --> 02:12:24,603
POLICE, THE SHERIFF'S 

4598
02:12:24,603 --> 02:12:24,903
DEPARTMENT. 

4599
02:12:24,903 --> 02:12:26,505
WE HAVE 10 DIFFERENT OTHER 

4600
02:12:26,505 --> 02:12:27,472
AGENCIES BACKING THEM UP. 

4601
02:12:27,472 --> 02:12:28,473
ALL THE STATE POLICE AGENCIES 

4602
02:12:28,473 --> 02:12:31,209
ARE HERE AS WELL, FEDERAL 

4603
02:12:31,209 --> 02:12:32,677
PARTNERS. 

4604
02:12:32,677 --> 02:12:33,712
IT'S A TRAGIC SITUATION, BUT 

4605
02:12:33,712 --> 02:12:34,679
THERE WERE SOME VERY BRAVE 

4606
02:12:34,679 --> 02:12:36,581
PEOPLE THAT CAME IN AND KEPT IT 

4607
02:12:36,581 --> 02:12:37,315
FROM BEING WORSE AND THE 

4608
02:12:37,315 --> 02:12:38,783
RESPONSE TIME WAS INCREDIBLE. 

4609
02:12:38,783 --> 02:12:42,020
SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. 

4610
02:12:45,924 --> 02:12:46,090
>> CHIEF? 

4611
02:12:47,559 --> 02:12:47,992
>> GOOD AFTERNOON. 

4612
02:12:47,992 --> 02:12:53,064
I PROMISED YOU GUYS AN UPDATE. 

4613
02:12:53,064 --> 02:12:54,866
DEPUTY CHIEF WILLIAM CRANSTON 

4614
02:12:54,866 --> 02:12:55,734
WITH THE ANNE ARUNDEL POLICE 

4615
02:12:55,734 --> 02:12:56,034
DEPARTMENT. 

4616
02:12:56,034 --> 02:12:58,670
SO THE BUILDING AS WE SPEAK IS 

4617
02:12:58,670 --> 02:13:00,906
NOW TACTICALLY SECURED AND WHAT 

4618
02:13:00,906 --> 02:13:02,140
THAT MEANS IS OUR S.W.A.T. 

4619
02:13:02,140 --> 02:13:03,408
TEAM AND OUR QUICK RESPONDERS 

4620
02:13:03,408 --> 02:13:04,775
HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE BUILDING. 

4621
02:13:04,775 --> 02:13:06,478
IT IS SECURE AS FAR AS THERE 

4622
02:13:06,478 --> 02:13:08,413
ARE NO MORE PERSONS IN THE 

4623
02:13:08,413 --> 02:13:09,880
BUILDING THAT ARE A THREAT TO 

4624
02:13:09,880 --> 02:13:10,649
ANYONE ELSE. 

4625
02:13:13,018 --> 02:13:14,453
WE DID RECOVER WHAT WE THOUGHT 

4626
02:13:14,453 --> 02:13:16,787
MAY HAVE BEEN AN EXPLOSIVE 

4627
02:13:16,787 --> 02:13:17,054
DEVICE. 

4628
02:13:17,054 --> 02:13:21,927
THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF. 

4629
02:13:21,927 --> 02:13:24,362
WE HAVE MEMBERS OF THE BOMB 

4630
02:13:24,362 --> 02:13:27,833
SQUAD ON SCENE. 

4631
02:13:27,833 --> 02:13:29,534
WE DON'T ANTICIPATE HAVING ANY 

4632
02:13:29,534 --> 02:13:30,067
MORE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES. 

4633
02:13:30,067 --> 02:13:31,169
WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW THAT YOU 

4634
02:13:31,169 --> 02:13:33,705
SEE BEHIND ME IS THAT OUR 

4635
02:13:33,705 --> 02:13:34,205
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 

4636
02:13:34,205 --> 02:13:35,107
DIVISION, THE ACTUAL 

4637
02:13:35,107 --> 02:13:36,508
INVESTIGATORS ARE NOW TAKING 

4638
02:13:36,508 --> 02:13:37,709
OVER THE SCENE. 

4639
02:13:37,709 --> 02:13:39,211
WE HAVE RELEASED IT TO OUR 

4640
02:13:39,211 --> 02:13:40,512
MEMBERS OF THE CRIMINAL 

4641
02:13:40,512 --> 02:13:41,813
INVESTIGATION DIVISION SO THEY 

4642
02:13:41,813 --> 02:13:43,515
CAN START THE PROCESS OF 

4643
02:13:43,515 --> 02:13:44,716
IDENTIFYING WHAT OCCURRED AND 

4644
02:13:44,716 --> 02:13:46,518
HOW IT OCCURRED AND WHY IT 

4645
02:13:46,518 --> 02:13:46,684
OCCURRED. 

4646
02:13:47,318 --> 02:13:50,555
SO AT THIS TIME WE HAD OVER 170 

4647
02:13:50,555 --> 02:13:52,257
INDIVIDUALS IN THE BUILDING 

4648
02:13:52,257 --> 02:13:53,558
THAT WERE ESCORTED OUT SAFELY. 

4649
02:13:53,558 --> 02:13:55,927
THEY WERE TAKEN TO A 

4650
02:13:55,927 --> 02:13:59,030
REUNIFICATION AREA OVER AT THE 

4651
02:13:59,030 --> 02:13:59,831

02:13:59,831 --> 02:14:01,666
WE BROUGHT JEN CORBIN IN FROM

02:14:01,666 --> 02:14:02,534

02:14:05,003 --> 02:14:06,971

02:15:51,876 --> 02:15:53,044
I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFICS ON 

4713
02:15:53,044 --> 02:15:56,214
THAT, BUT WE DO KNOW IT IS A 

4714
02:15:56,214 --> 02:15:56,481
LONG GUN. 

4715
02:15:56,481 --> 02:15:57,949
AS WE CONTINUE TO GET 

4716
02:15:57,949 --> 02:15:59,951
INFORMATION, WE WILL CONTINUE 

4717
02:15:59,951 --> 02:16:00,351
TO PUT THAT OUT. 

4718
02:16:00,351 --> 02:16:02,454
>> Reporter:  WHAT ABOUT THE 

4719
02:16:02,454 --> 02:16:02,787
MOTIVE? 

4720
02:16:02,787 --> 02:16:04,121
>> WE HAVE NO INFORMATION. 

4721
02:16:04,121 --> 02:16:06,391
HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY BY 

4722
02:16:06,391 --> 02:16:06,658
OFFICERS. 

4723
02:16:06,658 --> 02:16:08,293
THERE WAS NO GONE FIRE 

4724
02:16:08,293 --> 02:16:09,494
EXCHANGED BETWEEN OFFICERS AND 

4725
02:16:09,494 --> 02:16:09,861
THE SUSPECT. 

4726
02:16:09,861 --> 02:16:11,863
SINCE WE WERE ABLE TO GET HERE 

4727
02:16:11,863 --> 02:16:13,064
VERY QUICKLY AND SOMETHING FOR 

4728
02:16:13,064 --> 02:16:16,968
YOU GUYS TO KNOW, WE HAVE A 

4729
02:16:16,968 --> 02:16:19,004
UNIFIED TRAINING HOW TO RESPOND 

4730
02:16:19,004 --> 02:16:19,704
TO ACTIVE SHOOTERS. 

4731
02:16:19,704 --> 02:16:20,939
THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR THINGS 

4732
02:16:20,939 --> 02:16:22,941
THAT MADE THIS A HUGE SUCCESS. 

4733
02:16:22,941 --> 02:16:24,042
SO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES 

4734
02:16:24,042 --> 02:16:26,745
AROUND THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES 

4735
02:16:26,745 --> 02:16:28,647
TRAINED THE SAME WAY FOR THESE 

4736
02:16:28,647 --> 02:16:31,249
ACTIVE SHOOTERS SINCE WE'VE HAD 

4737
02:16:31,249 --> 02:16:33,050
CRITICAL INCIDENTS LIKE THIS. 

4738
02:16:33,050 --> 02:16:34,986
I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT'S VERY 

4739
02:16:34,986 --> 02:16:36,487
EASY, BUT IT'S VERY EASY FOR 

4740
02:16:36,487 --> 02:16:39,457
OFFICERS TO GET TOGETHER FROM 

4741
02:16:39,457 --> 02:16:40,892
OTHER JURISDICTIONS, LINK UP, 

4742
02:16:40,892 --> 02:16:41,558
KNOW THE TERMINOLOGY THAT'S 

4743
02:16:41,558 --> 02:16:45,096
NEEDED TO GO IN AND EFFECTIVELY 

4744
02:16:45,096 --> 02:16:46,064
LOCATE A SUSPECT IN AN ACTIVE 

4745
02:16:46,064 --> 02:16:48,466
SHOOTER SITUATION AND TAKE CARE 

4746
02:16:48,466 --> 02:16:50,402
OF THAT TARGET INSIDE THERE 

4747
02:16:50,402 --> 02:16:52,203
DURING AN ACTIVE SHOOTER. 

4748
02:16:53,772 --> 02:16:54,138
SAY THAT AGAIN. 

4749
02:16:54,138 --> 02:16:55,773
>> Reporter:  DID HE SHOOT 

4750
02:16:55,773 --> 02:16:56,741
THROUGH WINDOWS OR DOORS? 

4751
02:16:56,741 --> 02:16:58,442
HOW DID HE ENTER THE BUILDING? 

4752
02:16:58,442 --> 02:16:59,943
>> I CAN'T ANSWER THIS RIGHT 

4753
02:16:59,943 --> 02:17:00,144
NOW. 

4754
02:17:00,144 --> 02:17:01,946
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL BE 

4755
02:17:01,946 --> 02:17:03,448
DETERMINED BY OUR INVESTIGATORS 

4756
02:17:03,448 --> 02:17:05,250
AS THEY PROCESS THAT CRIME 

4757
02:17:05,250 --> 02:17:05,650

4773

ESTIMATED AROUND THREE. 

4774

THE NEWSROOM WHEN THIS 

4776
02:17:32,343 --> 02:17:32,611
HAPPENED? 

4777
02:17:32,611 --> 02:17:34,846
>> I DON'T KNOW, BUT WE HAD 

4778
02:17:34,846 --> 02:17:35,947
APPROXIMATELY 170 WE SAFELY 

4779

THE CAPITAL GAZETTE IN

ANNAPOLIS, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE 

4794
02:18:15,219 --> 02:18:16,287
BALTIMORE SUN NEWSPAPER. 

4795
02:18:16,287 --> 02:18:17,489
THERE WAS A SHOOTER THAT 

4796
02:18:17,489 --> 02:18:18,590
ENTERED THAT BUILDING THIS 

4797
02:18:18,590 --> 02:18:20,392
AFTERNOON, OPENED FIRE WITH A 

4798
02:18:20,392 --> 02:18:20,659
SHOTGUN. 

4799
02:18:20,659 --> 02:18:21,959
HE SHOT THROUGH A GLASS WINDOW 

4800
02:18:21,959 --> 02:18:23,695
OR DOOR AND I SAY HE BECAUSE WE 

4801
02:18:23,695 --> 02:18:24,995
KNOW HE'S A MAN. 

4802
02:18:24,995 --> 02:18:27,498
WE KNOW HE'S IN HIS 20s. 

4803
02:18:27,498 --> 02:18:29,032
WE KNOW HE'S WHITE. 

4804
02:18:29,032 --> 02:18:31,670
WE KNOW HE'S CURRENTLY BEING 

4805
02:18:31,670 --> 02:18:32,736
INTERROGATED BY DETECTIVES, BUT 

4806
02:18:32,736 --> 02:18:34,138
HE'S NOT GIVING HIS NAME. 

4807
02:18:34,138 --> 02:18:36,474
HE'S NOT COOPERATING AND HE HAS 

4808
02:18:36,474 --> 02:18:37,742
NO ID ON HIM. 

4809
02:18:37,742 --> 02:18:39,309
POLICE HAVE JUST SAID THAT IN 

4810
02:18:39,309 --> 02:18:40,745
ADDITION TO THE FIVE PEOPLE WHO 

4811
02:18:40,745 --> 02:18:42,246

THEY'VE BEEN TAKEN TO AREA 

4815
02:18:46,550 --> 02:18:46,950
HOSPITALS. 

4816
02:18:46,950 --> 02:18:48,585
WE'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT A 

4817
02:18:48,585 --> 02:18:49,387
POTENTIAL EXPLOSIVE DEVICE 

4818
02:18:49,387 --> 02:18:52,490
WHICH WAS ON THE SCENE HAS BEEN 

4819
02:18:52,490 --> 02:18:54,691
"TAKEN CARE OF," HAS BEEN 

4820
02:18:54,691 --> 02:18:55,025
NEUTRALIZED. 

4821
02:18:55,025 --> 02:18:55,994
CBS NEWS ALSO LEARNED THAT 

4822
02:18:55,994 --> 02:18:58,495
THERE WERE FAKE GRENADES AT THE 

4823
02:18:58,495 --> 02:19:01,099
SCENE, FLASH BANGS THAT EMIT 

4824
02:19:01,099 --> 02:19:02,100
SMOKE, CREATE CONFUSION. 

4825
02:19:02,100 --> 02:19:03,802
THOSE WERE ALSO RECOVERED AT 

4826
02:19:03,802 --> 02:19:04,102
THE SCENE. 

4827
02:19:04,102 --> 02:19:05,370
THERE WERE MULTIPLE LAYERS OF 

4828
02:19:05,370 --> 02:19:06,870
LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO HAVE BEEN

02:19:06,870 --> 02:19:09,874

WATCHING THIS PRESS BRIEFING, 

4838
02:19:26,391 --> 02:19:28,126
YOU SAID SEVERAL TIMES THIS 

4839
02:19:28,126 --> 02:19:29,294
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. 

4840
02:19:29,294 --> 02:19:30,695
>> IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND 

4841
02:19:30,695 --> 02:19:31,796
GRANTED WE HAVE LIMITED 

4842
02:19:31,796 --> 02:19:33,198
INFORMATION, BUT WHEN WE START 

4843
02:19:33,198 --> 02:19:34,799
LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION WE 

4844
02:19:34,799 --> 02:19:36,368
HAVE ON THIS PARTICULAR 

4845
02:19:36,368 --> 02:19:37,001
INDIVIDUAL, THE SHOOTING, WHERE 

4846
02:19:37,001 --> 02:19:39,671
IT OCCURRED, WHEN IT OCCURRED, 

4847
02:19:39,671 --> 02:19:41,873
THE FACT HE'S A WHITE MALE IN 

4848
02:19:41,873 --> 02:19:46,911
HIS 20s, THE FACT THAT HE'S NOW 

4849
02:19:46,911 --> 02:19:47,912
TRYING TO WITHHOLD HIS 

4850
02:19:47,912 --> 02:19:48,980
INFORMATION FROM LAW 

4851
02:19:48,980 --> 02:19:50,882
ENFORCEMENT BUT YET NOW WE 

4852
02:19:50,882 --> 02:19:53,051
UNDERSTAND THAT HE'S TRYING TO 

4853
02:19:53,051 --> 02:19:54,085
NOT DISCLOSE OR HE'S DONE 

4854
02:19:54,085 --> 02:19:55,820
SOMETHING TO PREVENT THEM FROM 

4855
02:19:55,820 --> 02:19:56,587
OBTAINING AS YOU WERE 

4856
02:19:56,587 --> 02:19:57,956
MENTIONING -- 

4857
02:19:57,956 --> 02:19:58,823
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

4858
02:19:58,823 --> 02:20:00,959
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM OUR 

4859
02:20:00,959 --> 02:20:02,394
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM HERE AT CBS 

4860
02:20:02,394 --> 02:20:04,796
IS THAT THE SUSPECT DAMAGED HIS 

4861
02:20:04,796 --> 02:20:07,499
FINGERTIPS SO LAW ENFORCEMENT 

4862
02:20:07,499 --> 02:20:08,066
CANNOT IDENTIFY HIM. 

4863
02:20:08,066 --> 02:20:09,200
SO THESE ARE EXTREME MEASURES 

4864
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:11,703
THAT HE TOOK TO HIDE HIS 

4865
02:20:11,703 --> 02:20:11,970
IDENTITY. 

4866
02:20:11,970 --> 02:20:12,236
>> RIGHT. 

4867
02:20:12,236 --> 02:20:13,771
AND THIS IS THE PART THAT 

4868
02:20:13,771 --> 02:20:15,173
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE WHEN 

4869
02:20:15,173 --> 02:20:16,774
WE HAVE THIS LIMITED 

4870
02:20:16,774 --> 02:20:17,942
INFORMATION, WE START BREAKING 

4871
02:20:17,942 --> 02:20:20,779
DOWN WHAT WE HAVE AND CLEARLY 

4872
02:20:20,779 --> 02:20:22,781
THIS DOES NOT SOUND LIKE A 

4873
02:20:22,781 --> 02:20:23,882
WORKPLACE VIOLENCE INCIDENT 

4874
02:20:23,882 --> 02:20:25,817
FROM A FORMER EMPLOYEE OR A 

4875
02:20:25,817 --> 02:20:26,217
CURRENT EMPLOYEE. 

4876
02:20:26,217 --> 02:20:27,285
>> WHY NOT? 

4877
02:20:27,285 --> 02:20:28,987
>> BECAUSE A WORKPLACE VIOLENCE 

4878
02:20:28,987 --> 02:20:30,522
INCIDENT IS GOING TO OCCUR FROM 

4879
02:20:30,522 --> 02:20:32,323
AN ACT FROM A SHOOTER THAT'S 

4880
02:20:32,323 --> 02:20:34,125
GOING TO HAVE AN AXE TO GRIND, 

4881
02:20:34,125 --> 02:20:36,327
IS GOING TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF 

4882
02:20:36,327 --> 02:20:37,962
DISDAIN TOWARDS THE WORKPLACE 

4883
02:20:37,962 --> 02:20:39,864
WHETHER IT'S CURRENT OR FORMER. 

4884
02:20:39,864 --> 02:20:42,166
I HAVE NEVER AND I'VE BEEN 

4885
02:20:42,166 --> 02:20:44,435
SPECIALIZING IN THAT SINCE THE 

4886
02:20:44,435 --> 02:20:47,372
MID-'80s, I HAVE NEVER ONCE 

4887
02:20:47,372 --> 02:20:47,772
SEEN THAT HAPPEN. 

4888
02:20:47,772 --> 02:20:48,706
A WORKPLACE VIOLENCE OFFENDER 

4889
02:20:48,706 --> 02:20:50,275
WANTS TO GET A POINT ACROSS, IS 

4890
02:20:50,275 --> 02:20:51,975
LOOKING FOR SPECIFIC 

4891
02:20:51,975 --> 02:20:53,378
INDIVIDUALS, SEEKS THEM OUT IN 

4892
02:20:53,378 --> 02:20:54,778
ORDER TO SEND A MESSAGE, HAS 

4893
02:20:54,778 --> 02:20:56,114
TOLD PEOPLE WHAT HE WAS GOING 

4894
02:20:56,114 --> 02:20:58,516
TO DO BEFORE HE DOES IT AND TO 

4895
02:20:58,516 --> 02:21:00,819
WHO HE WAS GOING TO DO IT TO, 

4896
02:21:00,819 --> 02:21:01,785
SO JUST THE OPPOSITE. 

4897
02:21:01,785 --> 02:21:03,421
HE'S NOT AT THAT POINT LOOKING 

4898
02:21:03,421 --> 02:21:04,622
TO HIDE HIS IDENTITY. 

4899
02:21:04,622 --> 02:21:05,823
HE WANTS PEOPLE TO KNOW WHO HE 

4900
02:21:05,823 --> 02:21:08,760
IS BECAUSE HE WANTS TO GET A 

4901
02:21:08,760 --> 02:21:09,127
MESSAGE ACROSS. 

4902
02:21:09,127 --> 02:21:09,727
A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BARTER 

4903
02:21:09,727 --> 02:21:11,129
THAT'S COMING INTO THE 

4904
02:21:11,129 --> 02:21:15,033
WORKPLACE THAT FOUND OUT THAT A 

4905
02:21:15,033 --> 02:21:18,136
FORMER PERSON, A GIRL FRIEND, A 

4906
02:21:18,136 --> 02:21:19,103
WIFE, WHATEVER, A SIGNIFICANT 

4907
02:21:19,103 --> 02:21:21,206
OTHER, IS NOW WITH SOMEBODY 

4908
02:21:21,206 --> 02:21:23,374
ELSE IS ANGRY AT THAT 

4909
02:21:23,374 --> 02:21:25,009
INDIVIDUAL, BUT THEY'RE ANGRY 

4910
02:21:25,009 --> 02:21:26,177
AT THE ENTIRE WORKPLACE. 

4911
02:21:26,177 --> 02:21:27,445
THEY WANT TO GET A MESSAGE 

4912
02:21:27,445 --> 02:21:28,713
ACROSS THAT THAT WAS THE ONE 

4913
02:21:28,713 --> 02:21:30,582
INDIVIDUAL, THAT WAS THE ONE 

4914
02:21:30,582 --> 02:21:32,317
GROUP, THE ONE PLACE HE 

4915
02:21:32,317 --> 02:21:33,618
COULDN'T CONTROL AND HE WANTS 

4916
02:21:33,618 --> 02:21:35,520
TO GET THE MESSAGE ACROSS THAT 

4917
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:37,121
HE WAS SETTING THE RECORD 

4918
02:21:37,121 --> 02:21:37,388
STRAIGHT. 

4919
02:21:37,388 --> 02:21:39,924
SO HE'S NOT GOING TO 

4920
02:21:39,924 --> 02:21:40,725
INTENTIONALLY HIDE HIS 

4921
02:21:40,725 --> 02:21:40,992
IDENTITY. 

4922
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:41,826
>> HE WANTS TO BE SEEN. 

4923
02:21:41,826 --> 02:21:43,661
>> HE WANTS TO BE SEEN AND HE 

4924
02:21:43,661 --> 02:21:44,562
WANTS TO BE HEARD. 

4925
02:21:44,562 --> 02:21:48,333
SO NOW WHEN WE SEE AN 

4926
02:21:48,333 --> 02:21:50,768
INDIVIDUAL THAT COMES INTO A 

4927
02:21:50,768 --> 02:21:51,436
WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE 

4928
02:21:51,436 --> 02:21:52,904
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND WE STILL 

4929
02:21:52,904 --> 02:21:55,006
DON'T KNOW WHERE THE SHOOTING 

4930
02:21:55,006 --> 02:21:55,973
OCCURRED, IF I'M CORRECT. 

4931
02:21:55,973 --> 02:21:57,474
WE DON'T KNOW THAT IT WAS A 

4932
02:21:57,474 --> 02:21:57,741
NEWSROOM. 

4933
02:21:57,741 --> 02:21:59,077
WE KNOW IT WAS IN A BUILDING 

4934
02:21:59,077 --> 02:22:00,111
THAT THEY'RE IN, BUT WE DON'T 

4935
02:22:00,111 --> 02:22:01,813
KNOW THAT IT WAS THERE AND WE 

4936
02:22:01,813 --> 02:22:03,414
KNOW THAT HE'S A WHITE MALE IN 

4937
02:22:03,414 --> 02:22:05,016
HIS 20s AND THAT'S ALL WE KNOW. 

4938
02:22:05,016 --> 02:22:07,385
NONE OF THAT MAKES SENSE OF WHY 

4939
02:22:07,385 --> 02:22:10,822
AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD WANT TO 

4940
02:22:10,822 --> 02:22:11,956
INTENTIONALLY HIDE THEIR 

4941
02:22:11,956 --> 02:22:12,890
IDENTITY, JUST THE OPPOSITE. 

4942
02:22:12,890 --> 02:22:15,159
>> WHAT KIND OF SUSPECTS HAVE 

4943
02:22:15,159 --> 02:22:16,260
YOU SEEN DAMAGE THEIR 

4944
02:22:16,260 --> 02:22:18,396
FINGERTIPS TO HIDE THEIR 

4945
02:22:18,396 --> 02:22:18,663
IDENTITY? 

4946
02:22:18,663 --> 02:22:19,330
I PRESUME TRYING TO RUB OFF THE 

4947
02:22:19,330 --> 02:22:21,966
SKIN SO THAT THE PRINTS DON'T 

4948
02:22:21,966 --> 02:22:23,100
COME THROUGH. 

4949
02:22:23,100 --> 02:22:23,434
>> RIGHT. 

4950
02:22:23,434 --> 02:22:25,003
GANG-RELATED INDIVIDUALS THAT 

4951
02:22:25,003 --> 02:22:28,406
I'VE WORKED IN THE PAST WITH 

4952
02:22:28,406 --> 02:22:30,608
THAT HAVE INTENTIONALLY TRIED 

4953
02:22:30,608 --> 02:22:34,379
TO USE ACIDIC TYPE OF SOLUTIONS 

4954
02:22:34,379 --> 02:22:35,313
TO MASQUERADE THEIR IDENTITY SO 

4955
02:22:35,313 --> 02:22:38,916
THEY COULDN'T BE FINGERPRINTED. 

4956
02:22:38,916 --> 02:22:39,617
THAT'S A GANG. 

4957
02:22:39,617 --> 02:22:41,019
THAT'S NORMALLY AFFILIATED WITH 

4958
02:22:41,019 --> 02:22:44,155
A GANG AND A VARIETY OF 

4959
02:22:44,155 --> 02:22:44,555
TERRORIST GROUPS. 

4960
02:22:44,555 --> 02:22:47,592
THE IRA USED TO DO IT AND I 

4961
02:22:47,592 --> 02:22:50,695
DON'T WANT TO CAST ASPERSIONS 

4962
02:22:50,695 --> 02:22:52,096
OR MAKE SPECULATIONS, BUT I CAN 

4963
02:22:52,096 --> 02:22:53,798
SAY CLEARLY WHAT I DO KNOW IS 

4964
02:22:53,798 --> 02:22:56,300
THIS IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH AN 

4965
02:22:56,300 --> 02:22:58,302
INDIVIDUAL THAT WOULD GO INTO A 

4966
02:22:58,302 --> 02:23:00,371
WORKPLACE FOR A WORKPLACE 

4967
02:23:00,371 --> 02:23:02,339
SHOOTING OR A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE-

4968
02:23:02,339 --> 02:23:03,541
RELATED INCIDENT OR EVEN 

4969
02:23:03,541 --> 02:23:06,144
SOMEBODY WITH AN AXE TO GRIND 

4970
02:23:06,144 --> 02:23:07,077
AGAINST THE MEDIA. 

4971
02:23:07,077 --> 02:23:09,847
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO THAT 

4972
02:23:09,847 --> 02:23:10,080
EXTENT. 

4973
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:11,049
THE FACT THIS INDIVIDUAL MADE 

4974
02:23:11,049 --> 02:23:13,017
THAT STEP AS YOU REPORTED, THAT 

4975
02:23:13,017 --> 02:23:14,552
THEY WERE DAMAGING THEIR 

4976
02:23:14,552 --> 02:23:15,186
FINGERTIPS TO WITHHOLD THEIR 

4977
02:23:15,186 --> 02:23:16,387
IDENTITY FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT, 

4978
02:23:16,387 --> 02:23:19,490
THAT PUTS US INTO AN ENTIRELY 

4979
02:23:19,490 --> 02:23:19,990
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. 

4980
02:23:19,990 --> 02:23:24,696
>> WHEN YOU HEAR THIS, IT MAKES 

4981
02:23:24,696 --> 02:23:26,397
ME THINK OF THE FACT THAT YOU 

4982
02:23:26,397 --> 02:23:28,399
POINTED OUT BEFORE IS HE 

4983
02:23:28,399 --> 02:23:29,833
BROUGHT IN A SLOT GUN INDICATED 

4984
02:23:29,833 --> 02:23:31,335
TO YOU THIS WAS PREMEDITATED. 

4985
02:23:31,335 --> 02:23:33,071
NOW WE KNOW HE DAMAGED HIS 

4986
02:23:33,071 --> 02:23:33,871
FINGERTIPS TO CONCEAL HIS 

4987
02:23:33,871 --> 02:23:36,441
IDENTITY BECAUSE HE KNEW HE 

4988
02:23:36,441 --> 02:23:37,375
WOULD BE FINGERPRINTED JUST 

4989
02:23:37,375 --> 02:23:39,043
UNDERLINES THE FACT THAT HE 

4990
02:23:39,043 --> 02:23:40,078
REALLY PLANNED THIS. 

4991
02:23:40,078 --> 02:23:40,544
>> NO QUESTION. 

4992
02:23:40,544 --> 02:23:42,580
AND THE OTHER PART OF THIS THAT 

4993
02:23:42,580 --> 02:23:44,649
WE STILL DON'T KNOW AND THIS IS 

4994
02:23:44,649 --> 02:23:46,050
THE PART GNAWING AT ME RIGHT 

4995
02:23:46,050 --> 02:23:47,685
NOW, WHERE DID THE SHOOTING 

4996
02:23:47,685 --> 02:23:48,219
OCCUR? 

4997
02:23:48,219 --> 02:23:49,587
WHERE DID THEY CAPTURE HIM? 

4998
02:23:49,587 --> 02:23:51,589
THEY GOT THERE IN 60 SECONDS, 

4999
02:23:51,589 --> 02:23:53,391
WHICH THANK GOD THEY DID, BUT 

5000
02:23:53,391 --> 02:23:55,526
WHERE DID THEY CAPTURE HIM? 

5001
02:23:55,526 --> 02:23:59,597
HE DOES ALL THIS AND THEN JUST 

5002
02:23:59,597 --> 02:24:00,665
LAYS HIS GO UP DOWN? 

5003
02:24:00,665 --> 02:24:01,599
I DON'T KNOW. 

5004
02:24:01,599 --> 02:24:04,102
THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO 

5005
02:24:04,102 --> 02:24:04,535
ME. 

5006
02:24:04,535 --> 02:24:06,037
DID THEY CATCH HIM WALKING OUT 

5007
02:24:06,037 --> 02:24:07,405
OF THE BUILDING. 

5008
02:24:07,405 --> 02:24:08,906
DID HE FULFILL HIS MISSION BY 

5009
02:24:08,906 --> 02:24:10,575
GOING TO A PARTICULAR PART OF 

5010
02:24:10,575 --> 02:24:11,976
THAT BUILDING, SHOOTING THE 

5011
02:24:11,976 --> 02:24:15,079
PEOPLE HE INTENDED TO AND AS HE 

5012
02:24:15,079 --> 02:24:17,381
EXITED THE POLICE CAUGHT HIM 

5013
02:24:17,381 --> 02:24:17,781
AND SURRENDERED. 

5014
02:24:17,781 --> 02:24:19,984
THAT'S A BIG ELEMENT OF OUR 

5015
02:24:19,984 --> 02:24:20,484
DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW. 

5016
02:24:20,484 --> 02:24:22,953
WE JUST DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER. 

5017
02:24:22,953 --> 02:24:26,324
>> WE SPILL HAVE RON HOSKO ON 

5018
02:24:26,324 --> 02:24:30,228
THE LINE, FORMER ASSISTANT FBI 

5019
02:24:30,228 --> 02:24:32,129
DIRECTOR AND CBS SECURITY 

5020
02:24:32,129 --> 02:24:32,396
ANALYST. 

5021
02:24:32,396 --> 02:24:34,065
RON, WERE YOU ABLE TO HEAR THAT 

5022
02:24:34,065 --> 02:24:34,432
PRESS BRIEFING? 

5023
02:24:34,432 --> 02:24:37,034
I THINK WE MAY HAVE JUST LOST 

5024
02:24:37,034 --> 02:24:37,234
RON. 

5025
02:24:37,234 --> 02:24:39,337
PAUL, WHAT I WAS GOING TO ASK 

5026
02:24:39,337 --> 02:24:41,305
RON IS WHAT DOES THE LOCATION 

5027
02:24:41,305 --> 02:24:43,207
OF THIS INCIDENT SAY TO YOU? 

5028
02:24:43,207 --> 02:24:45,142
THIS IS A NEWS ORGANIZATION. 

5029
02:24:45,142 --> 02:24:46,844
DOES THAT SUGGEST ANYTHING 

5030
02:24:46,844 --> 02:24:47,912
ABOUT A POSSIBLE MOTIVE? 

5031
02:24:47,912 --> 02:24:49,113
>> YES, IT CERTAINLY DOES. 

5032
02:24:49,113 --> 02:24:51,215
I DON'T WANT TO USE WORDS RIGHT 

5033
02:24:51,215 --> 02:24:52,617
NOW THAT COULD HAVE OUR VIEWERS 

5034
02:24:52,617 --> 02:24:54,986
GOING OFF IN A DIRECTION WE 

5035
02:24:54,986 --> 02:24:56,654
DON'T WANT THEM TO GO OFF INTO 

5036
02:24:56,654 --> 02:24:57,955
INTO THE EVENING, BUT REMEMBER 

5037
02:24:57,955 --> 02:24:58,255
SOMETHING. 

5038
02:24:58,255 --> 02:25:02,660
WHEN WE LOOK AND WE STUDY THE 

5039
02:25:02,660 --> 02:25:04,228
ATTACK AND BREAK DOWN THE 

5040
02:25:04,228 --> 02:25:05,963
BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS OF A 

5041
02:25:05,963 --> 02:25:08,533
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL THAT'S A 

5042
02:25:08,533 --> 02:25:10,868
SHOOTER, THERE ARE A LOT OF 

5043
02:25:10,868 --> 02:25:11,969
COMPONENTS FROM A BEHAVIORAL 

5044
02:25:11,969 --> 02:25:12,603
SIDE. 

5045
02:25:12,603 --> 02:25:13,805
YOU'RE BREAKING THIS DOWN IN 

5046
02:25:13,805 --> 02:25:14,205
FINE COMPONENTS. 

5047
02:25:14,205 --> 02:25:17,608
THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE SITTING 

5048
02:25:17,608 --> 02:25:18,109
WITH RIGHT NOW. 

5049
02:25:18,109 --> 02:25:19,043
WE HAVE THIS INDIVIDUAL 

5050
02:25:19,043 --> 02:25:21,612
INTENTIONALLY THAT HAS GONE TO 

5051
02:25:21,612 --> 02:25:26,117
THE EXTENT OF MASQUERADING HIS 

5052
02:25:26,117 --> 02:25:26,818
FINGERPRINTS, PICKED A 

5053
02:25:26,818 --> 02:25:27,919
WORKPLACE, BUT PICKED A 

5054
02:25:27,919 --> 02:25:29,554
BUILDING WHERE THE MEDIA IS SO 

5055
02:25:29,554 --> 02:25:31,322
HE GETS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE. 

5056
02:25:31,322 --> 02:25:33,157
I DON'T WANT TO GO FORWARD AND 

5057
02:25:33,157 --> 02:25:34,659
DROP THE BIG WORD, BUT I'M 

5058
02:25:34,659 --> 02:25:36,360
STARTING TO WONDER RIGHT NOW 

5059
02:25:36,360 --> 02:25:37,962
WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEANS WITH 

5060
02:25:37,962 --> 02:25:40,631
RESPECT TO THINK OF THE 

5061
02:25:40,631 --> 02:25:40,898
EXPOSURE. 

5062
02:25:40,898 --> 02:25:42,366
THINK OF THE BIG DROP IN THE 

5063
02:25:42,366 --> 02:25:43,167
BUCKET WITH RESPECT TO THE 

5064
02:25:43,167 --> 02:25:45,803
MESSAGE THAT IT'S SENDING. 

5065
02:25:45,803 --> 02:25:47,505
WE JUST HEARD FROM A CBS 

5066
02:25:47,505 --> 02:25:48,740
CORRESPONDENT ON THE GROUND 

5067
02:25:48,740 --> 02:25:49,941
TALKING ABOUT THE MASSIVE NEWS 

5068
02:25:49,941 --> 02:25:51,876
COVERAGE THIS IS GETTING. 

5069
02:25:51,876 --> 02:25:53,144
THIS IS MAKING ME START TO 

5070
02:25:53,144 --> 02:25:55,012
WONDER RIGHT NOW WHAT DIRECTION 

5071
02:25:55,012 --> 02:25:58,115
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WITH 

5072
02:25:58,115 --> 02:25:59,750
RESPECT TO THIS PARTICULAR 

5073
02:25:59,750 --> 02:26:00,718
INDIVIDUAL ESPECIALLY WITH THE 

5074
02:26:00,718 --> 02:26:03,054
FACT OF HOW EVASIVE HE IS WITH 

5075
02:26:03,054 --> 02:26:03,621
LAW ENFORCEMENT RIGHT NOW. 

5076
02:26:03,621 --> 02:26:04,989
>> THERE'S SO MANY QUESTIONS 

5077
02:26:04,989 --> 02:26:06,224
STILL THAT NEED ANSWERS. 

5078
02:26:06,224 --> 02:26:09,060
JUST TO RECAP WHAT WE KNOW SO 

5079
02:26:09,060 --> 02:26:09,260
FAR. 

5080
02:26:09,260 --> 02:26:12,663
THERE ARE FIVE PEOPLE DEAD IN 

5081
02:26:12,663 --> 02:26:13,130
ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND. 

5082
02:26:13,130 --> 02:26:14,365
THIS FOLLOWS A SHOOTING THAT 

5083
02:26:14,365 --> 02:26:18,269
HAPPENED THIS AFTERNOON WHERE A 

5084
02:26:18,269 --> 02:26:19,937
GUNMAN OPENED FIRE USING A 

5085
02:26:19,937 --> 02:26:22,039
SHOTGUN IN THE BUILDING THAT 

5086
02:26:22,039 --> 02:26:23,507
HOUSES THE CAPITAL GAZETTE. 

5087
02:26:23,507 --> 02:26:24,542
WE AND THE WORLD RECEIVED 

5088
02:26:24,542 --> 02:26:26,944
TWEETS FROM PEOPLE THERE WERE 

5089
02:26:26,944 --> 02:26:28,112
THERE, WHO ASKED FOR HELP. 

5090
02:26:28,112 --> 02:26:29,881
THERE IS A MAN WHO IDENTIFIES 

5091
02:26:29,881 --> 02:26:30,848
HIMSELF AS AN INTERN. 

5092
02:26:30,848 --> 02:26:33,918
SO IMAGINE HOW YOUNG HE MUST BE 

5093
02:26:33,918 --> 02:26:35,786
WHO SAID, " ACTIVE SHOOTER." 

5094
02:26:35,786 --> 02:26:37,154
HE GAVE THE ADDRESS WHERE THEY 

5095
02:26:37,154 --> 02:26:39,657
WERE AND WROTE, " PLEASE HELP 

5096
02:26:39,657 --> 02:26:39,890
US." 

5097
02:26:39,890 --> 02:26:41,259
TO IMAGINE THE FEAR HE MUST 

5098
02:26:41,259 --> 02:26:42,660
HAVE BEEN FEELING AT THAT TIME 

5099
02:26:42,660 --> 02:26:45,830
AND YET HAD THE PRESENCE OF 

5100
02:26:45,830 --> 02:26:47,865
MIND TO TRY TO SEND A SIGNAL 

5101
02:26:47,865 --> 02:26:49,166
ASKING FOR HELP. 

5102
02:26:49,166 --> 02:26:51,803
WE'VE ALSO RECEIVED DIRECT 

5103
02:26:51,803 --> 02:26:53,537
REPORTS FROM ONE OF THE 

5104
02:26:53,537 --> 02:26:55,139
REPORTERS IN THAT ROOM. 

5105
02:26:55,139 --> 02:26:57,341
HE IS A CRIME REPORTER WHO 

5106
02:26:57,341 --> 02:26:59,443
TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE 

5107
02:26:59,443 --> 02:27:01,512
SHOOTER SHOT THROUGH THE GLASS 

5108
02:27:01,512 --> 02:27:03,447
TO ENTER THE ROOM AND THAT HE 

5109
02:27:03,447 --> 02:27:05,049
SAW HIS COLLEAGUES GUNNED DOWN, 

5110
02:27:05,049 --> 02:27:07,118
THAT HE WASN'T COMFORTABLE 

5111
02:27:07,118 --> 02:27:08,786
ASCERTAINING WHETHER OR NOT 

5112
02:27:08,786 --> 02:27:09,954
PEOPLE WERE DEAD OR ALIVE. 

5113
02:27:09,954 --> 02:27:12,790
HE ALSO GAVE A QUOTE TO THE 

5114
02:27:12,790 --> 02:27:15,092
BALTIMORE SUN THAT SAID, "I'M A 

5115
02:27:15,092 --> 02:27:15,492
POLICE REPORTER. 

5116
02:27:15,492 --> 02:27:16,894
I WRITE ABOUT THAT STUFF, NOT 

5117
02:27:16,894 --> 02:27:20,064
NECESSARILY TO THIS EXTENT, BUT 

5118
02:27:20,064 --> 02:27:21,566
SHOOTINGS AND DEATH ALL THE 

5119
02:27:21,566 --> 02:27:23,134
TIME, BUT AS MUCH AS TIME GOING 

5120
02:27:23,134 --> 02:27:24,568
TO TRY TO ARTICULATE HOW 

5121
02:27:24,568 --> 02:27:26,237
TRAUMATIZING IT IS TO BE HIDING 

5122
02:27:26,237 --> 02:27:27,571
UNDER YOUR DESK, YOU DON'T KNOW 

5123
02:27:27,571 --> 02:27:30,841
UNTIL YOU'RE THERE AND YOU FEEL 

5124
02:27:30,841 --> 02:27:31,141
HELPLESS." 

5125
02:27:31,141 --> 02:27:33,744
WE HAVE HEARD HEARTWRENCHING 

5126
02:27:33,744 --> 02:27:35,813
REPORTS FROM PEOPLE AT THIS 

5127
02:27:35,813 --> 02:27:36,580
NEWSPAPER. 

5128
02:27:36,580 --> 02:27:37,181
THE METRO EDITOR FOR THE 

5129
02:27:37,181 --> 02:27:38,049
CAPITAL GAZETTE RELEASED A 

5130
02:27:38,049 --> 02:27:40,251
STATEMENT THAT REALLY TALKED 

5131
02:27:40,251 --> 02:27:41,252
ABOUT THE MISSION AND THE 

5132
02:27:41,252 --> 02:27:43,154
PASSION OF REPORTERS AT THIS 

5133
02:27:43,154 --> 02:27:45,790
PAPER AND HE SAID, " WE TRY TO 

5134
02:27:45,790 --> 02:27:46,223
EXPOSE CORRUPTION. 

5135
02:27:46,223 --> 02:27:47,792
WE TRY TO GET ACCESS TO PUBLIC 

5136
02:27:47,792 --> 02:27:49,961
RECORDS TO BRING LIGHT TO THE 

5137
02:27:49,961 --> 02:27:51,295
INNER WORKINGS OF GOVERNMENT 

5138
02:27:51,295 --> 02:27:52,763
DESPITE MAJOR HURDLES IN OUR 

5139
02:27:52,763 --> 02:27:53,364
WAY. 

5140
02:27:53,364 --> 02:27:54,665
THE REPORTERS AND EDITORS PUT 

5141
02:27:54,665 --> 02:27:56,900
ALL INTO FINDING THE TRUTH. 

5142
02:27:56,900 --> 02:27:58,536
THAT IS OUR MISSION." 

5143
02:27:58,536 --> 02:27:59,170
HE IS REALLY DEFENDING WHAT 

5144
02:27:59,170 --> 02:27:59,837
THEY DO.  

5145
02:27:59,837 --> 02:28:01,338
HE SAYS IN THIS STATEMENT THERE 

5146
02:28:01,338 --> 02:28:03,107
ARE NO 40 HOUR WORKWEEKS HERE. 

5147
02:28:03,107 --> 02:28:05,109
THERE ARE NO BIG PAYDAYS. 

5148
02:28:05,109 --> 02:28:10,547
THESE ARE PEOPLE COMMITTED TO 

5149
02:28:10,547 --> 02:28:11,449
JOURNALISM WHO ARE TRYING TO 

5150
02:28:11,449 --> 02:28:13,117
BRING TRUTH TO THEIR COMMUNITY 

5151
02:28:13,117 --> 02:28:13,918
AND NOW THE BIGGEST STORY IN 

5152
02:28:13,918 --> 02:28:17,288
THE COUNTRY IS UNFOLDING IN 

5153
02:28:17,288 --> 02:28:18,589
THEIR OWN BUILDING. 

5154
02:28:18,589 --> 02:28:19,890
THE CRIME REPORTER WHO IS SO 

5155
02:28:19,890 --> 02:28:23,394
USED TO REPORTING ON SHOOTINGS 

5156
02:28:23,394 --> 02:28:24,762
THAT HAPPEN ELSEWHERE REALLY 

5157
02:28:24,762 --> 02:28:25,963
SPOKE ABOUT THE DISBELIEF THIS 

5158
02:28:25,963 --> 02:28:28,465
WAS HAPPENING WHERE IT DID 

5159
02:28:28,465 --> 02:28:28,699
HAPPEN. 

5160
02:28:28,699 --> 02:28:29,567
AGAIN WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT 

5161
02:28:29,567 --> 02:28:31,902
THERE ARE FIVE FATALITIES. 

5162
02:28:31,902 --> 02:28:32,737
THE INFORMATION THAT WE GOT 

5163
02:28:32,737 --> 02:28:34,038
FROM A POLICE BRIEFING THAT 

5164
02:28:34,038 --> 02:28:37,041
ENDED MINUTES AGO IS THEY SAY 

5165
02:28:37,041 --> 02:28:42,813
AT LEAST THREE PEOPLE ARE 

5166
02:28:42,813 --> 02:28:43,080
INJURED. 

5167
02:28:43,080 --> 02:28:45,082
WE SAW ONE OF THOSE INJURED 

5168
02:28:45,082 --> 02:28:47,518
EVACUATED BY A HELICOPTER TO A 

5169
02:28:47,518 --> 02:28:47,918
NEARBY HOSPITAL. 

5170
02:28:47,918 --> 02:28:56,694
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE VICTIMS 

5171
02:28:56,694 --> 02:28:58,562
AT AT LEAST TWO AREA HOSPITALS. 

5172
02:28:58,562 --> 02:29:01,164
WITH ME NOW IS PAUL VIOLAS. 

5173
02:29:01,164 --> 02:29:03,700
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO BREAK DOWN 

5174
02:29:03,700 --> 02:29:04,802
THE MOTIVATION AND POSSIBLE 

5175
02:29:04,802 --> 02:29:06,036
MENTALITY OF THE SHOOTER. 

5176
02:29:06,036 --> 02:29:08,339
HE IS IN POLICE CUSTODY AND 

5177
02:29:08,339 --> 02:29:10,941
BEING INTERROGATED AS WE SPEAK 

5178
02:29:10,941 --> 02:29:11,308
BY DETECTIVES. 

5179
02:29:11,308 --> 02:29:12,777
WHAT ARE THOSE KEY QUESTIONS 

5180
02:29:12,777 --> 02:29:13,844
THAT THEY'RE ASKING HIM? 

5181
02:29:13,844 --> 02:29:14,845
>> THEY'RE GOING TO REALLY TRY 

5182
02:29:14,845 --> 02:29:24,688
TO SET HIM AT EASE RIGHT NOW.

5183
02:29:24,688 --> 02:29:25,856
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE 

5184
02:29:25,856 --> 02:29:28,292
HIM AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE 

5185
02:29:28,292 --> 02:29:29,226
AND DEVELOP A RAPPORT. 

5186
02:29:29,226 --> 02:29:30,795
THE SUPERVISOR NOW IN CHARGE OF 

5187
02:29:30,795 --> 02:29:31,962
THE DETECTIVES THAT ARE 

5188
02:29:31,962 --> 02:29:32,963
INTERVIEWING IS GOING TO 

5189
02:29:32,963 --> 02:29:33,965
CAREFULLY SELECT THE RIGHT 

5190
02:29:33,965 --> 02:29:35,766
PERSON, THE RIGHT INVESTIGATOR, 

5191
02:29:35,766 --> 02:29:36,600
THE RIGHT DETECTIVE THAT'S 

5192
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:39,103
GOING TO HAVE THE BEST RAPPORT, 

5193
02:29:39,103 --> 02:29:40,471
THAT'S GOING TO CLICK WITH THIS 

5194
02:29:40,471 --> 02:29:41,138
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL. 

5195
02:29:41,138 --> 02:29:42,840
THE KEY QUESTIONS THEY WANT TO 

5196
02:29:42,840 --> 02:29:44,842
UNDERSTAND IS MORE ABOUT THE 

5197
02:29:44,842 --> 02:29:47,044
PERSON'S BACKGROUND, WHO HE IS, 

5198
02:29:47,044 --> 02:29:49,046
WHERE HE'S FROM, WHY HE CAME 

5199
02:29:49,046 --> 02:29:51,482
THERE, HOW HE CAME THERE, DID 

5200
02:29:51,482 --> 02:29:52,482
HE DRIVE THERE. 

5201
02:29:52,482 --> 02:29:53,551
THEY'RE GOING TO ASK HIM 

5202
02:29:53,551 --> 02:29:55,686
QUESTIONS THAT ARE NOT GOING TO 

5203
02:29:55,686 --> 02:29:57,588
SOUND TO THE PERSON WHO IS 

5204
02:29:57,588 --> 02:29:59,390
BEING INTERVIEWED AS BEING 

5205
02:29:59,390 --> 02:30:01,191
INVASIVE, BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY 

5206
02:30:01,191 --> 02:30:01,992
INVASIVE. 

5207
02:30:01,992 --> 02:30:04,962
HOW DID YOU GET THERE TODAY OR 

5208
02:30:04,962 --> 02:30:07,465
WHERE ARE YOU FROM ORIGINALLY, 

5209
02:30:07,465 --> 02:30:08,899
BENCHMARK QUESTIONS TO HELP 

5210
02:30:08,899 --> 02:30:09,266
IDENTIFY HIM. 

5211
02:30:09,266 --> 02:30:09,967
WHENEVER YOU HAVE A SITUATION 

5212
02:30:09,967 --> 02:30:11,502
WHERE YOU HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL 

5213
02:30:11,502 --> 02:30:13,270
THAT IS NOT DISCLOSING THEIR 

5214
02:30:13,270 --> 02:30:14,271
IDENTITY, THAT'S OBSTRUCTING 

5215
02:30:14,271 --> 02:30:15,639
THE INVESTIGATION BY PREVENTING 

5216
02:30:15,639 --> 02:30:18,042
THAT, THEY'RE GOING TO ASK MORE 

5217
02:30:18,042 --> 02:30:19,043
OBSCURE QUESTIONS THAT WILL NOT 

5218
02:30:19,043 --> 02:30:21,345
ALERT THEM TO THAT FACT BUT 

5219
02:30:21,345 --> 02:30:23,047
BRING THEM TO THE POINT WHERE 

5220
02:30:23,047 --> 02:30:24,048
THAT WILL ASSIST THEM IN 

5221
02:30:24,048 --> 02:30:25,515
IDENTIFYING WHO THIS PERSON IS. 

5222
02:30:25,515 --> 02:30:26,984
THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO 

5223
02:30:26,984 --> 02:30:27,351
GO RIGHT NOW. 

5224
02:30:27,351 --> 02:30:29,086
>> IF THEY CAN'T RUN HIS 

5225
02:30:29,086 --> 02:30:31,489
FINGERPRINTS BECAUSE WE KNOW 

5226
02:30:31,489 --> 02:30:33,891
THAT HE'S DONE SOMETHING TO TRY 

5227
02:30:33,891 --> 02:30:35,593
TO DAMAGE HIS FINGERTIPS SO 

5228
02:30:35,593 --> 02:30:37,194
THAT HIS FINGERPRINTS CAN'T BE 

5229
02:30:37,194 --> 02:30:37,995
DETECTED AND CAN'T BE RUN 

5230
02:30:37,995 --> 02:30:39,162
THROUGH THE SYSTEM, HOW ARE 

5231
02:30:39,162 --> 02:30:40,331
THEY GOING TO FIGURE OUT WHO 

5232
02:30:40,331 --> 02:30:41,265
THIS GUY IS? 

5233
02:30:41,265 --> 02:30:44,135
>> BELIEVE IT OR NOT, SOONER OR 

5234
02:30:44,135 --> 02:30:44,702
LATER AND PROBABLY SOONER 

5235
02:30:44,702 --> 02:30:46,971
THEY'LL COME TO THE MEDIA AND 

5236
02:30:46,971 --> 02:30:48,405
PUT THIS PERSON'S FACE ON THE 

5237
02:30:48,405 --> 02:30:49,740
TELEVISION AND IT WON'T TAKE 

5238
02:30:49,740 --> 02:30:51,642
LONG AFTER THAT BEFORE HE'S 

5239
02:30:51,642 --> 02:30:51,942
IDENTIFIED. 

5240
02:30:51,942 --> 02:30:53,043
THEY'RE GOING TO USE THAT. 

5241
02:30:53,043 --> 02:30:55,980
THEY'RE GOING TO TELL THEM 

5242
02:30:55,980 --> 02:30:57,748
LOOK, WE DON'T WANT TO PUT YOUR 

5243
02:30:57,748 --> 02:30:58,148
FACE OUT THERE. 

5244
02:30:58,148 --> 02:30:59,950
IF YOU HAVE FAMILY, IF YOU HAVE 

5245
02:30:59,950 --> 02:31:02,086
FRIENDS, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO 

5246
02:31:02,086 --> 02:31:04,088
EMBARRASS THEM, IF YOU DON'T 

5247
02:31:04,088 --> 02:31:05,089
WANT TO HUMILIATE THEM, LET US 

5248
02:31:05,089 --> 02:31:07,024
KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND WE'LL TRY 

5249
02:31:07,024 --> 02:31:08,192
TO WORK THROUGH THIS. 

5250
02:31:08,192 --> 02:31:09,994
THEY'LL TRY TO ESTABLISH THAT 

5251
02:31:09,994 --> 02:31:11,595
RAPPORT, BUT THE MEDIA WILL BE 

5252
02:31:11,595 --> 02:31:13,631
THEIR BEST FRIEND BECAUSE IF 

5253
02:31:13,631 --> 02:31:14,698
HE'S GOING TO PLAY HARDBALL, 

5254
02:31:14,698 --> 02:31:16,233
THEY'LL PUT HIS FACE OUT THERE. 

5255
02:31:16,233 --> 02:31:17,334
HE'S NOT A MINOR. 

5256
02:31:17,334 --> 02:31:19,003
HE'S IN HIS 20s. 

5257
02:31:19,003 --> 02:31:22,573
THEY CAN PUT HIS FACE OUT THERE 

5258
02:31:22,573 --> 02:31:23,774
AND PUTTING HIS FACE OUT THERE 

5259
02:31:23,774 --> 02:31:26,310
AND USING TWO THINGS, FACIAL 

5260
02:31:26,310 --> 02:31:27,077
RECOGNITION, ARTIFICIAL 

5261
02:31:27,077 --> 02:31:27,978
INTELLIGENCE SOFTWARE AND USING 

5262
02:31:27,978 --> 02:31:29,647
THE MEDIA, THEY'LL FIND OUT WHO 

5263
02:31:29,647 --> 02:31:29,880
HE IS. 

5264
02:31:29,880 --> 02:31:31,581
IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE THAT 

5265
02:31:31,581 --> 02:31:32,082
LONG. 

5266
02:31:32,082 --> 02:31:33,684
>> SPEAKING OF TECHNOLOGY, 

5267
02:31:33,684 --> 02:31:35,920
EARLIER WE DISCUSSED HOW 

5268
02:31:35,920 --> 02:31:40,758
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS USED 

5269
02:31:40,758 --> 02:31:41,959
TO SCAN THROUGH SECURITY VIDEO 

5270
02:31:41,959 --> 02:31:42,826
AT THE SCENE. 

5271
02:31:42,826 --> 02:31:43,093
>> RIGHT. 

5272
02:31:43,093 --> 02:31:43,928
>> EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 

5273
02:31:43,928 --> 02:31:45,496
THAT TO US AND ALSO IN THE AGE 

5274
02:31:45,496 --> 02:31:47,831
OF CELL PHONES, HOW HAS THAT 

5275
02:31:47,831 --> 02:31:52,103
CHANGED THE GAME IN THESE TYPES 

5276
02:31:52,103 --> 02:31:52,703
OF SCENARIOS? 

5277
02:31:52,703 --> 02:31:54,504
>> AI IS PRETTY FASCINATING. 

5278
02:31:54,504 --> 02:31:57,808
THINK ABOUT TEACHING A CAMERA 

5279
02:31:57,808 --> 02:31:59,076
HOW TO THINK AND HOW TO 

5280
02:31:59,076 --> 02:32:01,244
REMEMBER AND HOW TO PROCESS. 

5281
02:32:01,244 --> 02:32:03,280
IT ACTUALLY TAKES SOMETHING, AN 

5282
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:05,983
OBJECT, A PICTURE, A SOUND, A 

5283
02:32:05,983 --> 02:32:08,586
MOTION AND IT MAKES IT LEARN 

5284
02:32:08,586 --> 02:32:09,887
WHEN IT HEARD IT BEFORE, WHERE 

5285
02:32:09,887 --> 02:32:10,988
IT HEARD IT BEFORE AND IT MAY 

5286
02:32:10,988 --> 02:32:12,189
NOT JUST BE A FACE. 

5287
02:32:12,189 --> 02:32:13,924
IT COULD BE CLOTHING. 

5288
02:32:13,924 --> 02:32:15,926
IT COULD BE THIS PARTICULAR 

5289
02:32:15,926 --> 02:32:16,293
OUTFIT. 

5290
02:32:16,293 --> 02:32:19,230
IT COULD BE ANYTHING ABOUT THAT 

5291
02:32:19,230 --> 02:32:20,397
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL AND IT 

5292
02:32:20,397 --> 02:32:23,100
WILL PROCESS THAT THROUGH 

5293
02:32:23,100 --> 02:32:24,201
HUNDREDS OF COMPUTERS LOOKING 

5294
02:32:24,201 --> 02:32:25,169
TO PROCESS WHERE THAT 

5295
02:32:25,169 --> 02:32:27,271
INDIVIDUAL WAS SEEN BEFORE. 

5296
02:32:27,271 --> 02:32:29,273
IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE FASCINATING 

5297
02:32:29,273 --> 02:32:34,678
AND YOU KNOW IN A METRO AREA 

5298
02:32:34,678 --> 02:32:37,948
THAT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS 

5299
02:32:37,948 --> 02:32:38,882
DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT THIS 

5300
02:32:38,882 --> 02:32:40,384
PARTICULAR AREA IN PUBLIC 

5301
02:32:40,384 --> 02:32:40,751
FACING CAMERAS. 

5302
02:32:40,751 --> 02:32:42,519
SO YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT 

5303
02:32:42,519 --> 02:32:43,988
THAT INFORMATION WHICH IS BEING 

5304
02:32:43,988 --> 02:32:46,223
PROCESSED RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE 

5305
02:32:46,223 --> 02:32:47,090
GOING THROUGH THAT TO LOCATE 

5306
02:32:47,090 --> 02:32:49,093
ANYTHING THAT THEY CAN WITH 

5307
02:32:49,093 --> 02:32:50,260
RESPECT TO THIS INDIVIDUAL, 

5308
02:32:50,260 --> 02:32:51,695
WHERE HE CAME FROM, WHERE HE 

5309
02:32:51,695 --> 02:32:54,031
LEFT FROM, CARS THAT HE GOT IN, 

5310
02:32:54,031 --> 02:32:55,765
PLATES THAT WERE BEHIND THAT, 

5311
02:32:55,765 --> 02:32:57,600
ANYBODY HE ASSOCIATED WITH, WHO 

5312
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:58,335
THEY WERE, ET CETERA. 

5313
02:32:58,335 --> 02:32:59,670
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT 

5314
02:32:59,670 --> 02:32:59,870
NOW. 

5315
02:32:59,870 --> 02:33:01,939
THAT'S THE KEY BEHIND THAT 

5316
02:33:01,939 --> 02:33:03,240
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, QUITE 

5317
02:33:03,240 --> 02:33:03,674
FASCINATING. 

5318
02:33:03,674 --> 02:33:07,244
>> MY MIND KEEPS GOING BACK TO 

5319
02:33:07,244 --> 02:33:08,078
THE DECEASED. 

5320
02:33:08,078 --> 02:33:09,947
THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS ARE 

5321
02:33:09,947 --> 02:33:11,782
PROBABLY RUSHING TO THAT 

5322
02:33:11,782 --> 02:33:15,586
LOCATION THAT POLICE HAVE TOLD 

5323
02:33:15,586 --> 02:33:17,021
PEOPLE TO GO TO BE REUNITED 

5324
02:33:17,021 --> 02:33:17,921
WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND I 

5325
02:33:17,921 --> 02:33:20,024
REMEMBER WHEN WE COVERED THE 

5326
02:33:20,024 --> 02:33:21,125
PARKLAND SHOOTING HOW MANY 

5327
02:33:21,125 --> 02:33:22,126
FAMILIES TOLD US THEY DIDN'T 

5328
02:33:22,126 --> 02:33:23,594
HAVE ANSWERS AND THEY WERE 

5329
02:33:23,594 --> 02:33:25,195
WAITING AT THAT MEETING POINT 

5330
02:33:25,195 --> 02:33:27,031
IN PARKLAND WHICH WAS THE LOCAL 

5331
02:33:27,031 --> 02:33:28,432
MARRIOTT HOTEL TO FIND OUT 

5332
02:33:28,432 --> 02:33:28,665
WONDER. 

5333
02:33:28,665 --> 02:33:30,134
HOW LONG DOES IT USUALLY TAKE 

5334
02:33:30,134 --> 02:33:33,971
IF THERE IS A USUAL AMOUNT OF 

5335
02:33:33,971 --> 02:33:36,774
TIME, FOR PEOPLE AND POLICE TO 

5336
02:33:36,774 --> 02:33:38,075
BE ABLE TO GET TO THE POINT 

5337
02:33:38,075 --> 02:33:39,610
WHERE THEY CAN INFORM FAMILY 

5338
02:33:39,610 --> 02:33:40,778
MEMBERS OF THE WORST? 

5339
02:33:41,678 --> 02:33:42,780
>> UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T 

5340
02:33:42,780 --> 02:33:44,415
TAKE TOO LONG, ESPECIALLY IN A 

5341
02:33:44,415 --> 02:33:45,382
SITUATION LIKE THIS. 

5342
02:33:45,382 --> 02:33:47,985
NOW WE HAVE COVERED SO MANY 

5343
02:33:47,985 --> 02:33:49,620
THINGS HERE AT CBS TOGETHER, 

5344
02:33:49,620 --> 02:33:53,424
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING HERE, FIVE 

5345
02:33:53,424 --> 02:33:54,425
FATALITIES, WHICH IS HORRIFIC, 

5346
02:33:54,425 --> 02:33:55,926
IT'S NOT LIKE WE WERE LOOKING 

5347
02:33:55,926 --> 02:33:57,293
AT SOMETHING LIKE WHEN WE 

5348
02:33:57,293 --> 02:34:00,331
COVERED LAS VEGAS OR WHEN WE 

5349
02:34:00,331 --> 02:34:01,999
COVERED PARKLAND OR, YOU KNOW, 

5350
02:34:01,999 --> 02:34:04,034
A VARIETY OF OTHER SHOOTINGS, 

5351
02:34:04,034 --> 02:34:06,904
BUT STILL THOSE INDIVIDUALS 

5352
02:34:06,904 --> 02:34:07,337
WILL BE IDENTIFIED. 

5353
02:34:07,337 --> 02:34:08,272
THERE'S A STAGING AREA. 

5354
02:34:08,272 --> 02:34:10,074
IF YOU CAN KIND OF PICTURE 

5355
02:34:10,074 --> 02:34:10,274
THIS. 

5356
02:34:10,274 --> 02:34:11,575
THERE'S A STAGING AREA WHERE 

5357
02:34:11,575 --> 02:34:12,576
FAMILY AND FRIENDS WILL BE 

5358
02:34:12,576 --> 02:34:15,980
BROUGHT TO AND THEY'LL BE HELD 

5359
02:34:15,980 --> 02:34:16,313
TO THE SIDE. 

5360
02:34:16,313 --> 02:34:17,848
ANYBODY ASKING QUESTIONS, 

5361
02:34:17,848 --> 02:34:18,482
THEY'LL HAVE A POLICE 

5362
02:34:18,482 --> 02:34:19,383
PSYCHOLOGIST AND A VARIETY OF 

5363
02:34:19,383 --> 02:34:20,384
OTHER PEOPLE RELATED TO THE 

5364
02:34:20,384 --> 02:34:22,119
CITY THAT WILL BE THERE 

5365
02:34:22,119 --> 02:34:25,089
SPEAKING WITH THEM UNTIL BODIES 

5366
02:34:25,089 --> 02:34:26,724
ARE IDENTIFIED. 

5367
02:34:32,863 --> 02:34:34,164
ONCE THE CRIME SCENE IS SECURE, 

5368
02:34:34,164 --> 02:34:35,332
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO IDENTIF 

5369
02:34:35,332 --> 02:34:37,834
WHETHER THOSE ARE THEIR FAMILY  

5370
02:34:37,834 --> 02:34:39,970
IT COULD BE AN INDIVIDUAL FOUND 

5371
02:34:39,970 --> 02:34:41,004
THAT'S DECEASED HAS 

5372
02:34:41,004 --> 02:34:42,273
IDENTIFICATION ON THEM AND AN 

5373
02:34:42,273 --> 02:34:43,507
INDIVIDUAL THAT'S IN A TENT 

5374
02:34:43,507 --> 02:34:44,575
THAT'S WAITING AND THEY'LL KNOW 

5375
02:34:44,575 --> 02:34:47,111
THAT YES, IN FACT, I JUST LEFT 

5376
02:34:47,111 --> 02:34:50,047
THERE AND I'VE BEEN THROUGH 

5377
02:34:50,047 --> 02:34:50,147
THIS. 

5378
02:34:50,714 --> 02:34:51,915
I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO TELL YOU 

5379
02:34:51,915 --> 02:34:53,484
THE PIT THAT YOU GET IN YOUR 

5380
02:34:53,484 --> 02:34:55,586
STOMACH WHEN YOU'VE LEFT HA 

5381
02:34:55,586 --> 02:34:57,321
SCENE AND YOU WALK OUTSIDE -- 

5382
02:34:57,321 --> 02:34:58,922
THAT SCENE AND YOU WALK OUTSIDE 

5383
02:34:58,922 --> 02:35:01,025
AND YOU JUST SAW THAT PERSON 

5384
02:35:01,025 --> 02:35:02,526
AND YOU SEE AN INDIVIDUAL AND 

5385
02:35:02,526 --> 02:35:03,827
THEY'RE HOLDING UP A PICTURE 

5386
02:35:03,827 --> 02:35:05,129
SAYING I'M LOOKING FOR MY MOM 

5387
02:35:05,129 --> 02:35:07,397
OR I'M LOOKING FOR MY SON OR 

5388
02:35:07,397 --> 02:35:08,732
I'M LOOKING FOR MY DAUGHTER. 

5389
02:35:08,732 --> 02:35:10,033
HAVE YOU SEEN THEM AND YOU LOOK 

5390
02:35:10,033 --> 02:35:11,935
THEM STRAIGHT IN THE FACE AND 

5391
02:35:11,935 --> 02:35:13,036
THEY'RE SHOWING UP THAT PICTURE 

5392
02:35:13,036 --> 02:35:15,105
AND YOUR HEART IS GOING TO 

5393
02:35:15,105 --> 02:35:16,974
EXPLODE ND I DON'T CARE IF YOU 

5394
02:35:16,974 --> 02:35:18,642
HAVE THE BEST POKER FACE IN THE 

5395
02:35:18,642 --> 02:35:20,511
WORLD, IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE 

5396
02:35:20,511 --> 02:35:22,112
NOT TO SHOW THAT PERSON EMOTION 

5397
02:35:22,112 --> 02:35:24,715
THAT YOU JUST SAW THAT. 

5398
02:35:25,616 --> 02:35:27,017
POLICE HAVE A VERY ORGANIZED 

5399
02:35:27,017 --> 02:35:28,585
SYSTEM AS TO WHO CAN SPEAK TO 

5400
02:35:28,585 --> 02:35:31,054
THE VICTIMS AND WHO CAN DEAL 

5401
02:35:31,054 --> 02:35:31,387
WITH FAMILY. 

5402
02:35:31,387 --> 02:35:32,723
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT 

5403
02:35:32,723 --> 02:35:34,625
NOW, BUT I CAN TELL YOU 

5404
02:35:34,625 --> 02:35:36,059
UNQUIVOCALLY THIS IS THE WORST 

5405
02:35:36,059 --> 02:35:38,061
PART OF IT IS DELIVERING THAT 

5406
02:35:38,061 --> 02:35:38,362
MESSAGE. 

5407
02:35:40,230 --> 02:35:43,233
THERE IS NO GOOD WAY OF DOING 

5408
02:35:43,233 --> 02:35:43,399
IT. 

5409
02:35:43,399 --> 02:35:45,436
I HAVE BEEN IN THIS A LONG 

5410
02:35:45,436 --> 02:35:45,636
TIME. 

5411
02:35:45,636 --> 02:35:47,370
I WILL TELL YOU I'VE BEEN THE 

5412
02:35:47,370 --> 02:35:49,006
HEAD OF ONE OF THE LARGEST 

5413
02:35:49,006 --> 02:35:50,207
POLICE ACADEMIES IN THE 

5414
02:35:50,207 --> 02:35:50,507
COUNTRY. 

5415
02:35:50,507 --> 02:35:52,209
THERE IS NO RIGHT WAY TO TEACH 

5416
02:35:52,209 --> 02:35:53,610
SOMEBODY HOW TO DELIVER THAT 

5417
02:35:53,610 --> 02:35:53,877
MESSAGE. 

5418
02:35:53,877 --> 02:35:57,181
THAT IS WHAT'S GOING ON NOW AS 

5419
02:35:57,181 --> 02:35:57,447
WE SPEAK. 

5420
02:35:57,447 --> 02:35:58,816
>> LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS 

5421
02:35:58,816 --> 02:36:02,586
TAKING ON THAT BURDEN TO TALK 

5422
02:36:02,586 --> 02:36:04,822
TO FAMILY MEMBERS OF THOSE WHO 

5423
02:36:04,822 --> 02:36:06,723
HAVE BEEN KILLED, FIVE PEOPLE 

5424
02:36:06,723 --> 02:36:09,793
WHO LOST THEIR LIVES INSIDE A 

5425
02:36:09,793 --> 02:36:11,362
BUILDING THAT HOUSES THE 

5426
02:36:11,362 --> 02:36:13,363

IT IS JUST -- THERE ARE NO 

5429
02:36:15,199 --> 02:36:15,933
WORDS. 

5430
02:36:15,933 --> 02:36:16,933
>> NO, THERE AREN'T, ABSOLUTELY 

5431
02:36:16,933 --> 02:36:17,234
NOT. 

5432
02:36:17,234 --> 02:36:19,736
>> FOR THOSE OF YOU JUST 

5433
02:36:19,736 --> 02:36:22,005
JOINING US, I'M ADRIANA DIAZ IN 

5434
02:36:22,005 --> 02:36:22,272
NEW YORK. 

5435
02:36:22,272 --> 02:36:24,208
WE WANT TO RECAP WHAT WE KNOW 

5436
02:36:24,208 --> 02:36:24,441
SO FAR. 

5437
02:36:24,441 --> 02:36:26,510
AT LEAST FIVE PEOPLE ARE DEAD 

5438
02:36:26,510 --> 02:36:27,811
AND AT LEAST THREE ARE WOUNDED 

5439
02:36:27,811 --> 02:36:30,214
AFTER A SHOOTING AT A NEWSPAPER 

5440
02:36:30,214 --> 02:36:30,981
IN ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND. 

5441
02:36:30,981 --> 02:36:32,015
WE'RE NOW LEARNING MORE ABOUT 

5442
02:36:32,015 --> 02:36:33,917
THE GUNMAN DESPITE HIS BEST 

5443
02:36:33,917 --> 02:36:34,184
EFFORTS. 

5444
02:36:34,184 --> 02:36:35,319
HE'S APPARENTLY GONE TO GREAT 

5445
02:36:35,319 --> 02:36:37,688
LENGTHS TO CONCEAL HIS 

5446
02:36:37,688 --> 02:36:41,058
IDENTITY, EVEN DAMAGING HIS 

5447
02:36:41,058 --> 02:36:41,525
FINGERTIPS TO AVOID 

5448
02:36:41,525 --> 02:36:41,892
FINGERPRINTING. 

5449
02:36:41,892 --> 02:36:43,227
POLICE A SHORT TIME AGO 

5450
02:36:43,227 --> 02:36:44,027
DESCRIBED HIM. 

5451
02:36:44,027 --> 02:36:47,297
>> WE KNOW HE'S A WHITE MALE, 

5452
02:36:47,297 --> 02:36:49,133
ADULT MALE, AND THE GUN USED IS 

5453
02:36:49,133 --> 02:36:50,634
DESCRIBED AS A LONG GUN. 

5454
02:36:50,634 --> 02:36:51,735
I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFICS ON 

5455
02:36:51,735 --> 02:36:53,604
THAT, BUT WE DO KNOW IT WAS A 

5456
02:36:53,604 --> 02:36:54,004
LONG GUN. 

5457
02:36:54,004 --> 02:36:55,138
AS WE CONTINUE TO GET 

5458
02:36:55,138 --> 02:36:56,907
INFORMATION, WE'LL CONTINUE TO 

5459
02:36:56,907 --> 02:36:57,307
PUT THAT OUT. 

5460
02:36:57,307 --> 02:36:59,242
WE'RE STILL DOING INTERVIEWS. 

5461
02:36:59,242 --> 02:37:00,878
>> Reporter:  HOW DID THEY 

5462
02:37:00,878 --> 02:37:01,178
CATCH HIM? 

5463
02:37:01,178 --> 02:37:03,213
>> HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY BY 

5464
02:37:03,213 --> 02:37:03,614
OFFICERS. 

5465
02:37:03,614 --> 02:37:05,215
THERE WAS NO GUNFIRE EXCHANGED 

5466
02:37:05,215 --> 02:37:07,117
BETWEEN OFFICERS AND THE 

5467
02:37:07,117 --> 02:37:07,384
SUSPECT. 

5468
02:37:07,384 --> 02:37:08,919
>> CBS NEWS KNOWS WHAT KIND OF 

5469
02:37:08,919 --> 02:37:09,453
GUN THAT WAS. 

5470
02:37:09,453 --> 02:37:10,720
IT WAS A SHOTGUN. 

5471
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:12,723
THIS HAPPENED AT THE OFFICES OF 

5472
02:37:12,723 --> 02:37:13,857
THE CAPITAL GAZETTE, A DAILY 

5473
02:37:13,857 --> 02:37:16,326

PHIL DAVIS IS A CRIME REPORTER 

5476
02:37:18,962 --> 02:37:19,696
AT THE GAZETTE. 

5477
02:37:19,696 --> 02:37:20,831
TODAY HE FOUND HIMSELF 

5478
02:37:20,831 --> 02:37:24,835
REPORTING ON A CRIME AT HIS OWN 

5479
02:37:24,835 --> 02:37:25,135
WORKPLACE. 

5480
02:37:25,135 --> 02:37:25,936
HE TWEETED, "GUNMAN SHOT

MUCH MORE AND DON'T WANT TO

DECLARE ANYONE DEAD, BUT IT'S 

5486

BAD," AND A SHORT TIME LATER HE 

5487
02:37:38,581 --> 02:37:40,417
WROTE, " THERE IS NOTHING MORE

5493
02:37:48,892 --> 02:37:52,596
HIMSELF AS AN INTERN AT THE

5500
02:38:11,114 --> 02:38:12,816
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE.

ARE STILL NOT IN THE CLEAR. 

5504
02:38:18,188 --> 02:38:20,424
THEY'RE BEING TREATED AT LOCAL

DEPLOYED TO MEDIA ORGA WHILE

THE NATURE OF THIS ATTACK IS 

5510
02:38:30,634 --> 02:38:31,568
BEING INVESTIGATED RIGHT NOW,

WE'RE NOW JOINED BY MARYLAND

02:38:42,045 --> 02:38:42,612
CONGRESSMAN JOHN SARBINS.

02:38:44,314 --> 02:38:45,916
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP AND HOW 

5519
02:38:45,916 --> 02:38:46,917
ARE THE PEOPLE YOU'VE BEEN

02:38:46,917 --> 02:38:49,252
SPEAKING TO WHO HAVE BEEN 

5521
02:38:49,252 --> 02:38:49,686
AFFECTED BY THIS? 

5522
02:38:49,686 --> 02:38:50,954
>> WELL, THE FIRST THING TO SAY 

5523
02:38:50,954 --> 02:38:53,857
IS THAT THE RESPONSE TO THIS 

5524
02:38:53,857 --> 02:38:54,924
TRAGEDY WAS VIRTUALLY 

5525
02:38:54,924 --> 02:38:55,225
IMMEDIATE. 

5526
02:38:55,225 --> 02:38:57,126
IT WAS 60 SECONDS AND LAW 

5527
02:38:57,126 --> 02:38:59,496
ENFORCEMENT AND FIRST 

5528
02:38:59,496 --> 02:39:08,505
RESPONDERS WERE ON THE SCENE. 

5529
02:39:08,505 --> 02:39:09,940
THEY VERY QUICKLY GOT THE 

5530
02:39:09,940 --> 02:39:11,174
SITUATION UNDER CONTROL AND 

5531
02:39:11,174 --> 02:39:12,709
TOOK THE SHOOTER INTO CUSTODY 

5532
02:39:12,709 --> 02:39:14,044
WHICH MEANS THEY COULD TURN TO 

5533
02:39:14,044 --> 02:39:16,513
THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS 

5534
02:39:16,513 --> 02:39:17,314
IMPACTED BY THIS TRAGIC 

5535
02:39:17,314 --> 02:39:18,781
SHOOTING AND THAT'S WHERE THE 

5536
02:39:18,781 --> 02:39:20,117
ATTENTION REMAINS RIGHT NOW, 

5537
02:39:20,117 --> 02:39:21,018
MAKING SURE WHATEVER 

5538
02:39:21,018 --> 02:39:22,085
INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE GETS 

5539
02:39:22,085 --> 02:39:24,354
TO THE FAMILIES AS QUICKLY AS 

5540
02:39:24,354 --> 02:39:24,621
POSSIBLE. 

5541
02:39:24,621 --> 02:39:25,488
THERE'S A REUNIFICATION CENTER 

5542
02:39:25,488 --> 02:39:26,489
SET UP NEARBY. 

5543
02:39:26,489 --> 02:39:33,497
THERE'S A CRISIS HOTLINE THAT 

5544
02:39:33,497 --> 02:39:34,164
THE ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY 

5545
02:39:34,164 --> 02:39:35,932
GOVERNMENT HAS SET UP TO ANSWER 

5546
02:39:35,932 --> 02:39:37,567
QUESTIONS COMING IN FROM 

5547
02:39:37,567 --> 02:39:37,867
FAMILIES. 

5548
02:39:37,867 --> 02:39:38,868
THAT'S NOW THE FIRST ORDER OF 

5549
02:39:38,868 --> 02:39:40,203
BUSINESS NOW THAT THE SHOOTING 

5550
02:39:40,203 --> 02:39:41,938
SCENE HAS BEEN LOCKED DOWN AND 

5551
02:39:41,938 --> 02:39:42,371
IS UNDER CONTROL. 

5552
02:39:42,371 --> 02:39:43,907
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE 

5553
02:39:43,907 --> 02:39:45,542
FAMILIES ARE GETTING ALL THE 

5554
02:39:45,542 --> 02:39:50,814
INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN. 

5555
02:39:50,814 --> 02:39:52,015
>> CONGRESSMAN, THIS IS YOUR 

5556
02:39:52,015 --> 02:39:52,449
DISTRICT. 

5557
02:39:52,449 --> 02:39:53,349
THESE ARE YOUR PEOPLE. 

5558
02:39:53,349 --> 02:39:54,618
TELL US ABOUT THIS NEWSPAPER, 

5559
02:39:54,618 --> 02:39:56,286
ITS ROLE AND WHAT THAT MEANS 

5560
02:39:56,286 --> 02:39:57,354
FOR YOUR COMMUNITY. 

5561
02:39:59,189 --> 02:40:02,392
>> SO ANNAPOLIS IS A SMALL, 

5562
02:40:02,392 --> 02:40:05,862
VERY TIGHTLY KNIT COMMUNITY. 

5563
02:40:05,862 --> 02:40:06,863
PEOPLE KNOW EACH OTHER HERE. 

5564
02:40:06,863 --> 02:40:09,499
PEOPLE KNOW THE REPORTERS THAT 

5565
02:40:09,499 --> 02:40:10,633
REPORT FOR THE GAZETTE. 

5566
02:40:10,633 --> 02:40:12,602
SO THE IMPACT OF THIS IS GOING 

5567
02:40:12,602 --> 02:40:17,374
TO RIPPLE OUT IN ALL 

5568
02:40:17,374 --> 02:40:17,841
DIRECTIONS. 

5569
02:40:17,841 --> 02:40:20,443
THIS IS A HOMETOWN NEWSPAPER. 

5570
02:40:20,443 --> 02:40:21,344
THEY PUBLISH ARTICLES AND 

5571
02:40:21,344 --> 02:40:22,746
FEATURE STORIES ABOUT THINGS 

5572
02:40:22,746 --> 02:40:25,649
THAT ARE GOING ON AROUND TOWN. 

5573
02:40:25,649 --> 02:40:26,950
IT'S ALWAYS HAD THAT FEEL TO IT 

5574
02:40:26,950 --> 02:40:28,986
AND IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A 

5575
02:40:28,986 --> 02:40:30,787
LONG, LONG TIME, DECADES AND 

5576
02:40:30,787 --> 02:40:31,054
DECADES. 

5577
02:40:31,054 --> 02:40:32,356
SO THERE'S REALLY A 

5578
02:40:32,356 --> 02:40:33,790
RELATIONSHIP THAT EXISTS 

5579
02:40:33,790 --> 02:40:35,559
BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE 

5580
02:40:35,559 --> 02:40:35,859
NEWSPAPER. 

5581
02:40:35,859 --> 02:40:38,428
SO TO HAVE THIS SHOOTING OCCUR 

5582
02:40:38,428 --> 02:40:39,763
RIGHT ON THE PREMISES OF THE 

5583
02:40:39,763 --> 02:40:43,133
NEWSPAPER OBVIOUSLY IS GOING TO 

5584
02:40:43,133 --> 02:40:43,566
SEND SHOCK WAVES. 

5585
02:40:43,566 --> 02:40:44,668
>> CONGRESSMAN, I'M SURE NO 

5586
02:40:44,668 --> 02:40:46,670
DOUBT YOU'VE HAD DEALINGS WITH 

5587
02:40:46,670 --> 02:40:47,237
THIS NEWSPAPER. 

5588
02:40:47,237 --> 02:40:48,939
I'M SURE THEIR REPORTERS HAVE 

5589
02:40:48,939 --> 02:40:49,339
INTERVIEWED YOU. 

5590
02:40:49,339 --> 02:40:51,041
DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO WAS IN 

5591
02:40:51,041 --> 02:40:51,274
THE BUILDING? 

5592
02:40:51,942 --> 02:40:58,148
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT YET 

5593
02:40:58,148 --> 02:40:59,850
BECAUSE THE IDENTITY OF THOSE 

5594
02:40:59,850 --> 02:41:00,917
AFFECTED IS STILL SOMETHING 

5595
02:41:00,917 --> 02:41:01,985
THAT HASN'T BEEN RELEASED. 

5596
02:41:01,985 --> 02:41:03,687
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO 

5597
02:41:03,687 --> 02:41:04,520
LEARN IN THE COMING DAYS THAT 

5598
02:41:04,520 --> 02:41:06,389
THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE 

5599
02:41:06,389 --> 02:41:08,358
INTERACTED WITH AND ON MANY 

5600
02:41:08,358 --> 02:41:10,293
OCCASIONS I'VE HAD THE TUNE TO 

5601
02:41:10,293 --> 02:41:13,563
SIT WITH REPORTERS FROM THE 

5602
02:41:13,563 --> 02:41:13,829
GAZETTE. 

5603
02:41:13,829 --> 02:41:15,098
>> CONGRESSMAN, DO WE KNOW IF 

5604
02:41:15,098 --> 02:41:16,566
THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED INSIDE 

5605
02:41:16,566 --> 02:41:19,403
THE NEWSROOM OF THE GAZETTE? 

5606
02:41:21,138 --> 02:41:23,340
>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT 

5607
02:41:23,340 --> 02:41:25,942
DID HAPPEN ON THE PREMISES AT 

5608
02:41:25,942 --> 02:41:26,309
THE NEWSROOM. 

5609
02:41:26,309 --> 02:41:27,944
SO OBVIOUSLY YOU'LL HAVE MORE 

5610
02:41:27,944 --> 02:41:29,846
INFORMATION AS TO EXACTLY WHAT 

5611
02:41:29,846 --> 02:41:30,146
TRANSPIRED. 

5612
02:41:30,146 --> 02:41:31,948
AGAIN I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE 

5613
02:41:31,948 --> 02:41:34,584
HOW QUICK THE RESPONSE WAS HERE 

5614
02:41:34,584 --> 02:41:37,387
AND COMMEND LAW ENFORCEMENT. 

5615
02:41:37,387 --> 02:41:39,289
NOT ONLY WAS THE RESPONSE VERY 

5616
02:41:39,289 --> 02:41:40,590
TIMELY, ALMOST IMMEDIATE, AS I 

5617
02:41:40,590 --> 02:41:42,259
SAY, BUT IT WAS VERY 

5618
02:41:42,259 --> 02:41:42,592
COORDINATED. 

5619
02:41:42,592 --> 02:41:45,896
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF 

5620
02:41:45,896 --> 02:41:50,367
DIFFERENT LAW ENFORCEMENT 

5621
02:41:50,367 --> 02:41:51,000
OFFICIALS AND JURISDICTIONS 

5622
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:52,168
THAT CAME TOGETHER AND RIGHT 

5623
02:41:52,168 --> 02:41:53,570
BEHIND THAT A CRISIS 

5624
02:41:53,570 --> 02:41:56,540
INTERVENTION AND CRISIS 

5625
02:41:56,540 --> 02:41:58,108
RESPONSE TEAM SET UP THE 

5626
02:41:58,108 --> 02:41:58,842
REUNIFICATION CENTER AND MADE 

5627
02:41:58,842 --> 02:41:59,643
SURE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE 

5628
02:41:59,643 --> 02:42:02,045
DONE TO HELP THE FAMILIES IS 

5629
02:42:02,045 --> 02:42:02,345
BEING DONE. 

5630
02:42:02,345 --> 02:42:09,286
>> WE UNDERSTAND FROM THE MAYOR 

5631
02:42:09,286 --> 02:42:11,488
THAT THERE WAS AN ACTIVE 

5632
02:42:11,488 --> 02:42:13,123
SHOOTER TRAINING AS RECENT AS 

5633
02:42:13,123 --> 02:42:13,423
LAST WEEK. 

5634
02:42:13,423 --> 02:42:14,457
SO THIS IS SOMETHING LOCAL LAW 

5635
02:42:14,457 --> 02:42:15,659
ENFORCEMENT REALLY TRAINED FOR 

5636
02:42:15,659 --> 02:42:16,993
AND WAS REALLY AWARE OF TRYING 

5637
02:42:16,993 --> 02:42:17,994
TO PLAN FOR HOW THEY WOULD 

5638
02:42:17,994 --> 02:42:19,629
RESPOND TO THIS KIND OF EVENT. 

5639
02:42:19,629 --> 02:42:21,598
IN ONE OF YOUR TWEETS YOU SAID 

5640
02:42:21,598 --> 02:42:23,266
THAT YOUR OFFICE HAS 

5641
02:42:23,266 --> 02:42:23,733
ESTABLISHED LINES OF 

5642
02:42:23,733 --> 02:42:25,669
COMMUNICATION WITH THE FBI AND 

5643
02:42:25,669 --> 02:42:25,969
THE ATF. 

5644
02:42:25,969 --> 02:42:29,172
WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING FROM 

5645
02:42:29,172 --> 02:42:29,272
THEM? 

5646
02:42:33,543 --> 02:42:35,045
>> I THINK THEY HAVE THE SAME 

5647
02:42:35,045 --> 02:42:36,446
ANALYSIS AS THE LOCAL LAW 

5648
02:42:36,446 --> 02:42:36,846
ENFORCEMENT DOES. 

5649
02:42:36,846 --> 02:42:38,281
THEY WANT TO BE READY TO 

5650
02:42:38,281 --> 02:42:38,915
PROVIDE WHATEVER SUPPORT THEY, 

5651
02:42:38,915 --> 02:42:40,750
CAN BUT I CAN SAY THE LOCAL AND 

5652
02:42:40,750 --> 02:42:41,918
COUNTY OFFICIALS AND STATE 

5653
02:42:41,918 --> 02:42:43,253
OFFICIALS AND THEIR TEAMS HAVE 

5654
02:42:43,253 --> 02:42:47,390
REALLY DONE A TERRIFIC JOB IN 

5655
02:42:47,390 --> 02:42:49,860
TERMS OF WORKING TOGETHER TO 

5656
02:42:49,860 --> 02:42:50,894
MEET THE EMERGING NEEDS FROM 

5657
02:42:50,894 --> 02:42:51,261
THE SITUATION. 

5658
02:42:51,261 --> 02:42:54,097
SO I THINK THE SITUATION IS NOW 

5659
02:42:54,097 --> 02:43:01,938
UNDER CONTROL AND AGAIN THE 

5660
02:43:01,938 --> 02:43:03,840
IMPORTANT THING IS WE GET 

5661
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:05,375
INFORMATION TO FAMILIES AS 

5662
02:43:05,375 --> 02:43:05,842
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. 

5663
02:43:05,842 --> 02:43:06,843
>> CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU SO 

5664
02:43:06,843 --> 02:43:08,044
MUCH FOR CHECKING IN WITH US. 

5665
02:43:08,044 --> 02:43:14,951
WE WANT TO BRING IN NOW 

5666
02:43:14,951 --> 02:43:17,187
MARYLAND DEMOCRATIC SENATOR BEN 

5667
02:43:17,187 --> 02:43:17,420
CARDIN. 

5668
02:43:17,420 --> 02:43:20,791
SENATOR, WE'VE SEEN YOUR TWEET. 

5669
02:43:20,791 --> 02:43:22,492
YOU WROTE THAT YOU ARE 

5670
02:43:22,492 --> 02:43:23,159
DEVASTATED AND REMAIN GRATEFUL 

5671
02:43:23,159 --> 02:43:24,194
TO FIRST RESPONDERS. 

5672
02:43:24,194 --> 02:43:26,062
WE WERE TOLD BY POLICE FIRST 

5673
02:43:26,062 --> 02:43:27,163
RESPONDERS WERE THERE WITHIN 60 

5674
02:43:27,163 --> 02:43:27,430
SECONDS. 

5675
02:43:27,430 --> 02:43:28,899
WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU 

5676
02:43:28,899 --> 02:43:29,299
HEARD THAT? 

5677
02:43:29,299 --> 02:43:32,002
>> WELL, FIRST WE ARE VERY 

5678
02:43:32,002 --> 02:43:32,769
GRATEFUL FOR THE FIRST 

5679
02:43:32,769 --> 02:43:33,770
RESPONDERS BECAUSE THEY GO INTO 

5680
02:43:33,770 --> 02:43:36,039
HARM'S WAY IN ORDER TO SAVE 

5681
02:43:36,039 --> 02:43:37,741
LIVES AND THEY CLEARLY 

5682
02:43:37,741 --> 02:43:38,875
RESPONDED IN A VERY 

5683
02:43:38,875 --> 02:43:39,308
PROFESSIONAL WAY. 

5684
02:43:39,308 --> 02:43:41,144
THIS IS SUCH A TRAGIC 

5685
02:43:41,144 --> 02:43:41,945
SITUATION. 

5686
02:43:41,945 --> 02:43:43,312
I KNOW THE ANNAPOLIS GAZETTE. 

5687
02:43:43,312 --> 02:43:45,882
IT'S A LOCAL PAPER THAT COVERS 

5688
02:43:45,882 --> 02:43:46,249
THE COMMUNITY. 

5689
02:43:46,249 --> 02:43:48,652
THE COMMUNITY IS VERY PROUD OF 

5690
02:43:48,652 --> 02:43:49,019
THE NEWSPAPER. 

5691
02:43:49,019 --> 02:43:50,887
THIS HAPPENING ANYWHERE IS 

5692
02:43:50,887 --> 02:43:52,589
TRAGIC, BUT IT'S SO HARD TO 

5693
02:43:52,589 --> 02:43:54,057
UNDERSTAND SOMEONE USING A 

5694
02:43:54,057 --> 02:43:55,525
SHOTGUN TO BREAK INTO THIS 

5695
02:43:55,525 --> 02:43:57,493
OFFICE AND KILLING PEOPLE. 

5696
02:43:57,493 --> 02:43:59,396
THE FIRST RESPONDERS CLEARLY 

5697
02:43:59,396 --> 02:44:05,936
ACTED VERY, VERY QUICKLY AND 

5698
02:44:05,936 --> 02:44:07,737
PROFESSIONALLY  AND GOT THE 

5699
02:44:07,737 --> 02:44:09,272
SITUATION, CONTROL AS QUICKLY 

5700
02:44:09,272 --> 02:44:09,673
AS POSSIBLE. 

5701
02:44:09,673 --> 02:44:10,573
UNFORTUNATELY SOME PEOPLE LOST 

5702
02:44:10,573 --> 02:44:11,775
THEIR LIVES AND OTHER PEOPLE 

5703
02:44:11,775 --> 02:44:14,044
ARE STILL AT RISK. 

5704
02:44:14,044 --> 02:44:21,251
>> SENATOR, WHEN YOU LAWMAKERS 

5705
02:44:21,251 --> 02:44:22,786
WHEN YOU'RE BACK ON CAPITOL 

5706
02:44:22,786 --> 02:44:24,387
HILL, WHAT MESSAGE WILL YOU 

5707
02:44:24,387 --> 02:44:24,754
BRING WITH YOU? 

5708
02:44:24,754 --> 02:44:25,956
>> WELL, THIS SHOULD NOT BE 

5709
02:44:25,956 --> 02:44:27,623
HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. 

5710
02:44:27,623 --> 02:44:29,192
WE'VE ALL GOT TO COME TOGETHER. 

5711
02:44:29,192 --> 02:44:30,894
THERE'S TOO MUCH VIOLENCE HERE 

5712
02:44:30,894 --> 02:44:31,194
IN AMERICA. 

5713
02:44:31,194 --> 02:44:32,595
WE MUST HAVE A STRATEGY TO HELP 

5714
02:44:32,595 --> 02:44:35,398
DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE. 

5715
02:44:35,398 --> 02:44:36,967
INACTION IS NOT AN OPPOSITE. 

5716
02:44:36,967 --> 02:44:38,501
WE DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS, 

5717
02:44:38,501 --> 02:44:41,938
THE MOTIVATION BEHIND THIS, BUT 

5718
02:44:41,938 --> 02:44:44,774
WE KNOW THERE'S JUST TOO MANY 

5719
02:44:44,774 --> 02:44:45,241
OF THESE SHOOTINGS. 

5720
02:44:45,241 --> 02:44:47,177
ONE IS TOO, BUT THE NUMBER -- 

5721
02:44:47,177 --> 02:44:49,145
IS TOO MANY, BUT THE NUMBER OF 

5722
02:44:49,145 --> 02:44:53,950
FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THIS IS 

5723
02:44:53,950 --> 02:44:56,720
CONCERNING SHOULD AFFECT ALL 

5724
02:44:56,720 --> 02:44:57,020
AMERICANS. 

5725
02:44:57,020 --> 02:44:58,421
>> DO YOU THINK GUN DEBATE WILL 

5726
02:44:58,421 --> 02:44:59,889
COME FROM THIS? 

5727
02:44:59,889 --> 02:45:00,256
>> ABSOLUTELY. 

5728
02:45:00,256 --> 02:45:01,624
WE KNOW FROM PREVIOUS SHOOTINGS 

5729
02:45:01,624 --> 02:45:03,093
AND GUN VIOLENCE THAT, YOU'RE 

5730
02:45:03,093 --> 02:45:04,494
SO MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE A 

5731
02:45:04,494 --> 02:45:06,196
VICTIM OF GUN VIOLENCE IN THE 

5732
02:45:06,196 --> 02:45:07,097
UNITED STATES THAN ANY OTHER 

5733
02:45:07,097 --> 02:45:08,898
INDUSTRIAL NATIONS IN THE 

5734
02:45:08,898 --> 02:45:09,131
WORLD. 

5735
02:45:09,131 --> 02:45:10,333
WE KNOW THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT 

5736
02:45:10,333 --> 02:45:11,501
WE CAN DO. 

5737
02:45:11,501 --> 02:45:12,736
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD HAVE 

5738
02:45:12,736 --> 02:45:14,471
AN IMPACT ON THIS EPISODE, BUT 

5739
02:45:14,471 --> 02:45:16,573
CLEARLY WE NEED UNIVERSAL 

5740
02:45:16,573 --> 02:45:17,273
BACKGROUND CHECKS AND NEED TO 

5741
02:45:17,273 --> 02:45:20,810
GET RID OF THE MILITARY ASSAULT 

5742
02:45:20,810 --> 02:45:21,778
RIFLES AND PRIVATE OWNERSHIP. 

5743
02:45:21,778 --> 02:45:23,246
THOSE ARE TWO BASIC THINGS THAT 

5744
02:45:23,246 --> 02:45:24,581
CAN GET DONE THAT WOULD 

5745
02:45:24,581 --> 02:45:25,982
CERTAINLY HELP THE SITUATION. 

5746
02:45:25,982 --> 02:45:27,383
WE DO NEED A NATIONAL DIALOGUE 

5747
02:45:27,383 --> 02:45:31,721
AND WE NEED TO TAKE MULTIPLE 

5748
02:45:31,721 --> 02:45:33,223
STRATEGIES IN ORDER TO ADDRESS 

5749
02:45:33,223 --> 02:45:34,290
VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY. 

5750
02:45:34,290 --> 02:45:35,625
>> SENATOR, DO YOU THINK 

5751
02:45:35,625 --> 02:45:36,993
LAWMAKERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE 

5752
02:45:36,993 --> 02:45:38,795
AISLE CAN GET BEHIND THOSE 

5753
02:45:38,795 --> 02:45:39,028
POINTS? 

5754
02:45:39,028 --> 02:45:40,096
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY 

5755
02:45:40,096 --> 02:45:43,133
ATTEMPTS AT GUN REFORM IN THE 

5756
02:45:43,133 --> 02:45:45,101
PAST THAT HAVE FAILED. 

5757
02:45:45,101 --> 02:45:47,370
>> I UNDERSTAND THERE'S LIKE A 

5758
02:45:47,370 --> 02:45:53,944
90% PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR 

5759
02:45:53,944 --> 02:45:56,846
UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND 

5760
02:45:56,846 --> 02:45:59,082
THERE'S STILL OVERWHELMING 

5761
02:45:59,082 --> 02:46:00,917
SUPPORT FOR GETTING RID OF 

5762
02:46:00,917 --> 02:46:02,085
MILITARY STYLE WEAPONS. 

5763
02:46:02,085 --> 02:46:04,387
SO YES, I THINK WE CAN AND WE 

5764
02:46:04,387 --> 02:46:06,289
SAW FROM THE STUDENTS OF 

5765
02:46:06,289 --> 02:46:08,191
PARKLAND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO 

5766
02:46:08,191 --> 02:46:09,092
STAY ENGAGED IN OUR PROCESS TO 

5767
02:46:09,092 --> 02:46:10,760
GET ADULTS TO ACT AS ADULTS. 

5768
02:46:10,760 --> 02:46:12,495
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL HAPPEN 

5769
02:46:12,495 --> 02:46:13,496
THIS YEAR, BUT I DO BELIEVE 

5770
02:46:13,496 --> 02:46:15,498
YOU'LL SEE PROGRESS ON THESE 

5771
02:46:15,498 --> 02:46:15,731
ISSUES. 

5772
02:46:15,731 --> 02:46:17,300
>> SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

5773
02:46:17,300 --> 02:46:19,269
WE KNOW YOU'RE VERY BUSY TRYING 

5774
02:46:19,269 --> 02:46:20,603
TO HELP YOUR CONSTITUENTS. 

5775
02:46:20,603 --> 02:46:23,173
WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. 

5776
02:46:23,173 --> 02:46:23,573
>> THANK YOU. 

5777
02:46:23,573 --> 02:46:26,776
>> LET'S GO BACK NOW TO PAUL 

5778
02:46:26,776 --> 02:46:29,479
VIOLAS, THE CBS NEWS SECURITY 

5779
02:46:29,479 --> 02:46:29,746
ANALYST. 

5780
02:46:29,746 --> 02:46:31,648
WE JUST STEPPED BACK AND LOOKED 

5781
02:46:31,648 --> 02:46:32,815
AT THE NATIONAL IMPLICATIONS 

5782
02:46:32,815 --> 02:46:34,684
SPEAKING TO THE NATIONAL 

5783
02:46:34,684 --> 02:46:35,485
LAWMAKERS WHO CALL MARYLAND 

5784
02:46:35,485 --> 02:46:35,986
HOME. 

5785
02:46:35,986 --> 02:46:37,620
LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID, 

5786
02:46:37,620 --> 02:46:40,623
YOU NEVER THOUGHT THIS WOULD 

5787
02:46:40,623 --> 02:46:41,957
HAPPEN IN YOUR BACKYARD. 

5788
02:46:41,957 --> 02:46:42,224
>> RIGHT. 

5789
02:46:42,224 --> 02:46:43,927
>> I HAVE TO SAY THE MORE THIS 

5790
02:46:43,927 --> 02:46:44,727
HAPPENS, THE MORE WE'RE 

5791
02:46:44,727 --> 02:46:45,962
STARTING TO HEAR PEOPLE SAY WE 

5792
02:46:45,962 --> 02:46:48,131
KNEW IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF 

5793
02:46:48,131 --> 02:46:48,932
TIME. 

5794
02:46:48,932 --> 02:46:49,632
>> YOU KNOW THE FRIGHTENING 

5795
02:46:49,632 --> 02:46:51,835
PART ABOUT THIS IS THOSE 

5796
02:46:51,835 --> 02:46:52,535
RESPONSES HAVE RESONATED FROM 

5797
02:46:52,535 --> 02:46:53,102
COMMUNITY TO COMMUNITY TO 

5798
02:46:53,102 --> 02:46:55,238
COMMUNITY FOR THE LAST 20 OR 30 

5799
02:46:55,238 --> 02:46:57,006
YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING 

5800
02:46:57,006 --> 02:46:57,439
THIS CONVERSATION. 

5801
02:46:57,439 --> 02:46:58,308
THIS IS NOTHING NEW. 

5802
02:46:58,308 --> 02:46:59,809
I REMEMBER MANY, MANY YEARS AGO 

5803
02:46:59,809 --> 02:47:02,011
WHEN WE HAD THAT MASS SHOOTING 

5804
02:47:02,011 --> 02:47:06,049
IN BUCKHEAD, GEORGIA, AND 

5805
02:47:06,049 --> 02:47:07,383
YOU'VE GOT THIS MASS CASUALTY 

5806
02:47:07,383 --> 02:47:10,053
AND THE HEADLINES READ, "NOT 

5807
02:47:10,053 --> 02:47:12,021
HERE IN BUCKHEAD," AND IF YOU 

5808
02:47:12,021 --> 02:47:13,723
THINK BACK, EVERY TIME THERE'S 

5809
02:47:13,723 --> 02:47:14,824
A MASS SHOOTING, EVERY TIME 

5810
02:47:14,824 --> 02:47:16,692
THERE'S A SITUATION LIKE THIS, 

5811
02:47:16,692 --> 02:47:17,326
TOMORROW'S NEWSPAPER WILL READ 

5812
02:47:17,326 --> 02:47:19,029
THE SAME THING AND IT'S GOING 

5813
02:47:19,029 --> 02:47:22,332
TO READ SHOCK IN ANNAPOLIS, 

5814
02:47:22,332 --> 02:47:23,833
SHOCK HERE AND I WONDER WHAT 

5815
02:47:23,833 --> 02:47:24,834
IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOR US TO 

5816
02:47:24,834 --> 02:47:26,669
GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE 

5817
02:47:26,669 --> 02:47:30,406
REALIZE THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE 

5818
02:47:30,406 --> 02:47:32,008
SHOCKED, THAT THIS HAPPENS 

5819
02:47:32,008 --> 02:47:32,308
EVERYWHERE. 

5820
02:47:32,308 --> 02:47:33,510
THAT IT SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING  

5821
02:47:33,510 --> 02:47:35,011
WITH MORE AND MORE FREQUENCY. 

5822
02:47:35,011 --> 02:47:35,912
>> I AGREE. 

5823
02:47:35,912 --> 02:47:37,981
>> WE JUST RECEIVED A REPORT 

5824
02:47:37,981 --> 02:47:39,716
FROM OUR INVESTIGATIVE TEAM 

5825
02:47:39,716 --> 02:47:42,285
HERE AT CBS NEWS THAT SAYS 

5826
02:47:42,285 --> 02:47:43,052
INVESTIGATORS ARE NOW USING 

5827
02:47:43,052 --> 02:47:44,854
FACIAL RECOGNITION TO TRY TO 

5828
02:47:44,854 --> 02:47:45,788
IDENTIFY THE SUSPECT. 

5829
02:47:45,788 --> 02:47:47,624
AS WE DISCUSSED, THE SUSPECT 

5830
02:47:47,624 --> 02:47:49,259
HAS GONE TO MANY LENGTHS TO 

5831
02:47:49,259 --> 02:47:50,927
HIDE HIS IDENTITY. 

5832
02:47:50,927 --> 02:47:51,895
HE SOMEHOW DAMAGED HIS 

5833
02:47:51,895 --> 02:47:52,629
FINGERTIPS TO MAKE IT HARDER 

5834
02:47:52,629 --> 02:47:54,831
FOR HIM TO BE FINGERPRINTED. 

5835
02:47:54,831 --> 02:47:58,635
HE DIDN'T CARRY ANY ID WITH 

5836
02:47:58,635 --> 02:47:58,835
HIM. 

5837
02:47:58,835 --> 02:47:59,903
WE'RE SAYING HE BECAUSE WE KNOW 

5838
02:47:59,903 --> 02:48:02,205
HE'S A MAN IN HIS 20s AND IS 

5839
02:48:02,205 --> 02:48:04,707
WHITE AND USED A SHOTGUN. 

5840
02:48:04,707 --> 02:48:05,942
BEYOND THAT WE KNOW VERY LITTLE 

5841
02:48:05,942 --> 02:48:06,876
ABOUT THIS MAN. 

5842
02:48:06,876 --> 02:48:09,546
IT SOUNDS LIKE DETECTIVE ITS 

5843
02:48:09,546 --> 02:48:09,879
DON'T EITHER. 

5844
02:48:09,879 --> 02:48:10,647
THEY'RE INTERROGATING HIM NOW 

5845
02:48:10,647 --> 02:48:12,849
AS WE SPEAK ACCORDING TO 

5846
02:48:12,849 --> 02:48:13,149
POLICE. 

5847
02:48:13,149 --> 02:48:15,452
HOW EFFECTIVE IS FACIAL 

5848
02:48:15,452 --> 02:48:15,919
RECOGNITION SOFTWARE? 

5849
02:48:15,919 --> 02:48:16,886
>> IT'S ACTUALLY VERY 

5850
02:48:16,886 --> 02:48:17,186
EFFECTIVE. 

5851
02:48:17,186 --> 02:48:18,388
THIS IS THE THING WE WERE 

5852
02:48:18,388 --> 02:48:21,958
TALKING ABOUT THE LAST HOUR OR 

5853
02:48:21,958 --> 02:48:23,893
SO, ABOUT ARTIFICIAL 

5854
02:48:23,893 --> 02:48:24,226
INTELLIGENCE. 

5855
02:48:24,226 --> 02:48:25,395
THIS INFORMATION IS INVALUABLE. 

5856
02:48:25,395 --> 02:48:27,297
THE TOOLS THAT DETECTIVES AND 

5857
02:48:27,297 --> 02:48:28,498
LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE AVAILABLE 

5858
02:48:28,498 --> 02:48:30,500
TO THEM TODAY IS QUITE 

5859
02:48:30,500 --> 02:48:30,833
SIGNIFICANT. 

5860
02:48:30,833 --> 02:48:33,570
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS 

5861
02:48:33,570 --> 02:48:34,771
INDIVIDUAL'S PICTURE AND IF WE 

5862
02:48:34,771 --> 02:48:37,540
BREAK THIS DOWN, TAKE THIS úIND 

5863
02:48:37,540 --> 02:48:42,946
IT INTO HUNDRED OF THOUSANDS 

5864
02:48:42,946 --> 02:48:43,679
OF CAMERAS, SERVERS THROUGHOUT 

5865
02:48:43,679 --> 02:48:46,082
THE ENTIRE AREA AND THAT FACIAL 

5866
02:48:46,082 --> 02:48:47,150
RECOGNITION SOFTWARE IS GOING 

5867
02:48:47,150 --> 02:48:49,185
TO LET THEM KNOW WHERE THAT 

5868
02:48:49,185 --> 02:48:49,652
PERSON'S BEEN SEEN. 

5869
02:48:49,652 --> 02:48:51,087
WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY MEAN? 

5870
02:48:51,087 --> 02:48:53,323
THINK ABOUT YOU AND I, ALL OF 

5871
02:48:53,323 --> 02:48:55,191
OUR VIEWERS AND WHAT WE DO ON A 

5872
02:48:55,191 --> 02:48:56,793
DAILY BASIS, WALKING TO GET A 

5873
02:48:56,793 --> 02:48:58,194
COUPLE OF COFFEE, GOING OUT TO 

5874
02:48:58,194 --> 02:49:00,096
DINNER, WALKING TO THE SUBWAY, 

5875
02:49:00,096 --> 02:49:01,998
GETTING INTO OUR CAR, GOING TO 

5876
02:49:01,998 --> 02:49:02,532
THE MALL. 

5877
02:49:02,532 --> 02:49:03,365
EVERYWHERE HAS CAMERAS. 

5878
02:49:03,365 --> 02:49:05,401
>> SO YOU'RE SAYING A PHOTO 

5879
02:49:05,401 --> 02:49:07,770
THEY TAKE OF HIM TODAY IS GOING 

5880
02:49:07,770 --> 02:49:10,673
TO REGISTER WITH JUST SECURITY 

5881
02:49:10,673 --> 02:49:11,307
CAMERAS FOOTAGE THAT'S CAPTURED 

5882
02:49:11,307 --> 02:49:12,375
HIM IN THE PAST? 

5883
02:49:12,375 --> 02:49:12,841
>> CORRECT. 

5884
02:49:12,841 --> 02:49:14,277
>> WE HAVE THAT TECHNOLOGY? 

5885
02:49:14,277 --> 02:49:16,179
>> WE HAVE THAT TECHNOLOGY. 

5886
02:49:16,179 --> 02:49:17,380
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS PICK 

5887
02:49:17,380 --> 02:49:22,385
OF HIM AND RUN IT THROUGH EVERY 

5888
02:49:22,385 --> 02:49:23,486
AVAILABLE FACIAL RECOGNITION 

5889
02:49:23,486 --> 02:49:25,955
DATABASE THAT THEY HAVE IN THE 

5890
02:49:25,955 --> 02:49:28,992
ENTIRE AREA TO SEE WHERE HE'S 

5891
02:49:28,992 --> 02:49:30,927
BEEN BEFORE, WHO HE WAS WITH, 

5892
02:49:30,927 --> 02:49:32,695
WHAT HE WAS WEARING, WHAT HE 

5893
02:49:32,695 --> 02:49:34,197
WAS DRIVING, WHERE DID HE GO. 

5894
02:49:34,197 --> 02:49:35,999
SO AS MUCH AS THIS GUY THINKS 

5895
02:49:35,999 --> 02:49:39,302
THAT HE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO 

5896
02:49:39,302 --> 02:49:40,870
NOT DISCLOSE THIS INFORMATION 

5897
02:49:40,870 --> 02:49:41,938
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE USE OF 

5898
02:49:41,938 --> 02:49:43,673
THIS TIME OF SOFTWARE IS GOING 

5899
02:49:43,673 --> 02:49:45,275
TO ENABLE US TO GET TO THE 

5900
02:49:45,275 --> 02:49:46,576
POSITION WHERE WE'LL KNOW WHO 

5901
02:49:46,576 --> 02:49:46,809
HE IS. 

5902
02:49:46,809 --> 02:49:49,112
>> IT WILL ALSO RUN THROUGH 

5903
02:49:49,112 --> 02:49:51,581
SYSTEMS THAT HAVE DRIVER'S 

5904
02:49:51,581 --> 02:49:53,149
LICENSE PHOTOS, MUGSHOTS, 

5905
02:49:53,149 --> 02:49:53,549
PASSPORT PHOTOS. 

5906
02:49:53,549 --> 02:49:54,684
>> PEOPLE HE'S ASSOCIATED WITH, 

5907
02:49:54,684 --> 02:49:56,486
CARS THAT HE'S DRIVEN, PLACES 

5908
02:49:56,486 --> 02:49:58,721
HE'S BEEN AND GO AFTER THOSE 

5909
02:49:58,721 --> 02:49:58,954
PEOPLE. 

5910
02:49:58,954 --> 02:50:00,923
I SAW YOU WERE WITH THIS 

5911
02:50:00,923 --> 02:50:01,356
PARTICULAR PERSON. 

5912
02:50:01,356 --> 02:50:03,125
WHO IS THIS PARTICULAR PERSON? 

5913
02:50:03,125 --> 02:50:04,760
>> SO IT CREATES A STORY. 

5914
02:50:04,760 --> 02:50:05,928
>> IT CREATES A BIG STORY AND 

5915
02:50:05,928 --> 02:50:07,197
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THAT 

5916
02:50:07,197 --> 02:50:08,898
IS WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. 

5917
02:50:08,898 --> 02:50:11,134
>> WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON 

5918
02:50:11,134 --> 02:50:12,201
HIS POSSIBLE MOTIVE BASED ON 

5919
02:50:12,201 --> 02:50:13,970
THE THINGS WE HAVE LEARNED SO 

5920
02:50:13,970 --> 02:50:16,773
FAR AND FOR OUR VIEWERS JUST 

5921
02:50:16,773 --> 02:50:18,741
JOINING US, WE KNOW THIS IS A 

5922
02:50:18,741 --> 02:50:20,209
SHOOTING AT THE CAPITAL GAZETTE 

5923
02:50:20,209 --> 02:50:20,476
NEWSROOM. 

5924
02:50:20,476 --> 02:50:21,945
IT HAPPENED IN THE NEWSROOM 

5925
02:50:21,945 --> 02:50:23,479
ACCORDING TO A CONGRESSMAN WE 

5926
02:50:23,479 --> 02:50:26,049
JUST HAD ON THE PHONE. 

5927
02:50:26,049 --> 02:50:27,283
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TALKING, 

5928
02:50:27,283 --> 02:50:28,785
WE THOUGHT MAYBE THAT MEANT HE 

5929
02:50:28,785 --> 02:50:31,821
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A DISGRUNTLED 

5930
02:50:31,821 --> 02:50:32,522
FORMER EMPLOYEE, IT MIGHT HAVE 

5931
02:50:32,522 --> 02:50:34,390
BEEN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCEISSUE, 

5932
02:50:34,390 --> 02:50:35,725
BUT THE FACT HE IS TRYING TO 

5933
02:50:35,725 --> 02:50:37,960
CONCEAL HIS IDENTITY BY 

5934
02:50:37,960 --> 02:50:38,695
DAMAGING HIS FINGERTIPS, WHAT 

5935
02:50:38,695 --> 02:50:40,029
DOES THAT TELL YOU, PAUL? 

5936
02:50:40,029 --> 02:50:41,731
>> IT TAKES ME AWAY FROM THE 

5937
02:50:41,731 --> 02:50:43,666
CONVERSATION WE HAD BEFORE. 

5938
02:50:43,666 --> 02:50:45,702
IF, IN FACT, WHAT THE SENATOR 

5939
02:50:45,702 --> 02:50:50,073
SAID IS CORRECT -- HE WAS 

5940
02:50:50,073 --> 02:50:50,406
SPECULATING. 

5941
02:50:50,406 --> 02:50:51,708
HE DIDN'T SAY IT WAS CONFIRMED, 

5942
02:50:51,708 --> 02:50:53,576
THAT IT HAPPENED IN THE 

5943
02:50:53,576 --> 02:50:53,876
NEWSROOM. 

5944
02:50:53,876 --> 02:50:55,077
LET'S JUST SAY IT DID. 

5945
02:50:55,077 --> 02:50:56,678
IF IT HAPPENED IN THE NEWSROOM, 

5946
02:50:56,678 --> 02:50:58,881
THAT'S GOING TO TELL US THAT 

5947
02:50:58,881 --> 02:51:01,384
PARTICULAR SHOOTER WANTED GRAND 

5948
02:51:01,384 --> 02:51:01,717
RECOGNITION. 

5949
02:51:01,717 --> 02:51:02,885
INITIALLY ONE MAY THINK IF IT 

5950
02:51:02,885 --> 02:51:04,020
HAPPENED IN THE NEWSROOM, IT 

5951
02:51:04,020 --> 02:51:06,522
MAY HAVE BEEN LIKE WE TALKED 

5952
02:51:06,522 --> 02:51:06,889
ABOUT IN 2015. 

5953
02:51:06,889 --> 02:51:09,125
IT MAY HAVE BEEN A DISGRUNTLED 

5954
02:51:09,125 --> 02:51:11,327
EMPLOYEE THAT CAME INTO THE 

5955
02:51:11,327 --> 02:51:12,795
NEWSROOM TO PERPETRATE SOME ACT 

5956
02:51:12,795 --> 02:51:14,297
OF VIOLENCE AS A FORM OF 

5957
02:51:14,297 --> 02:51:14,630
RETRIBUTION. 

5958
02:51:14,630 --> 02:51:16,299
>> THAT CASE OF THE SHOOTER WHO 

5959
02:51:16,299 --> 02:51:17,967
KILLED A REPORTER AND ANOTHER 

5960
02:51:17,967 --> 02:51:18,700
EMPLOYEE IN VIRGINIA. 

5961
02:51:18,700 --> 02:51:20,903
>> WHILE THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE 

5962
02:51:20,903 --> 02:51:21,303
OF BROADCASTING. 

5963
02:51:21,303 --> 02:51:21,537
>> YES. 

5964
02:51:21,537 --> 02:51:23,705
>> HE WAS SENDING A MESSAGE. 

5965
02:51:23,705 --> 02:51:24,707
REMEMBER HE WANTED EVERYONE TO 

5966
02:51:24,707 --> 02:51:26,609
KNOW WHO HE WAS. 

5967
02:51:26,609 --> 02:51:27,777
SO THAT WORKPLACE VIOLENCE 

5968
02:51:27,777 --> 02:51:29,879
OFFENDER COMING INTO THE 

5969
02:51:29,879 --> 02:51:31,247
NEWSROOM, IT'S UNLIKELY THEY 

5970
02:51:31,247 --> 02:51:33,383
WOULD DO ANYTHING TO SHIELD 

5971
02:51:33,383 --> 02:51:34,784
THEIR IDENTITY BECAUSE THAT 

5972
02:51:34,784 --> 02:51:35,685
DETRACTS FROM THEIR AGENDA WHY 

5973
02:51:35,685 --> 02:51:37,420
THEY WENT THERE IN THE FIRST 

5974
02:51:37,420 --> 02:51:37,653
PLACE. 

5975
02:51:37,653 --> 02:51:41,124
THAT'S THE REASON I DON'T SEE 

5976
02:51:41,124 --> 02:51:41,924
THAT BEING THEM. 

5977
02:51:41,924 --> 02:51:43,126
THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PIECE, 

5978
02:51:43,126 --> 02:51:43,826
THE KEY INFORMATION YOU 

5979
02:51:43,826 --> 02:51:46,929
REPORTED ON ABOUT HIM DAMAGING 

5980
02:51:46,929 --> 02:51:47,663
HIS FINGERTIPS, THAT DOESN'T 

5981
02:51:47,663 --> 02:51:53,803
FIT FOR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 

5982
02:51:53,803 --> 02:51:55,872
BARTER COMING -- BATTERER 

5983
02:51:55,872 --> 02:51:57,607
COMING TO THE WORKPLACE. 

5984
02:51:57,607 --> 02:51:58,574
IT JUST DOESN'T FIT. 

5985
02:51:58,574 --> 02:52:00,276
COULD IT BE AN INDIVIDUAL THAT 

5986
02:52:00,276 --> 02:52:02,612
HAD AN AXE TO GRIND WITH THIS 

5987
02:52:02,612 --> 02:52:04,580
PARTICULAR NEWS AGENCY ABOUT 

5988
02:52:04,580 --> 02:52:05,080
SOMETHING THEY REPORTED 

5989
02:52:05,080 --> 02:52:08,384
RECENTLY OR IN THE PAST THAT HE 

5990
02:52:08,384 --> 02:52:10,620
FELT SO COMPELLED THAT HE FELT 

5991
02:52:10,620 --> 02:52:12,522
THAT HE NEEDED TO MAKE A 

5992
02:52:12,522 --> 02:52:13,423
MESSAGE, SOMETHING THAT WAS 

5993
02:52:13,423 --> 02:52:16,159
OFFENSIVE TO HIM OR OFFENSIVE 

5994
02:52:16,159 --> 02:52:18,027
POSSIBLY TO HIS RELIGION OR HIS 

5995
02:52:18,027 --> 02:52:19,929
CULTURE OR A GROUP THAT HE'S 

5996
02:52:19,929 --> 02:52:20,329
AFFILIATED WITH. 

5997
02:52:20,329 --> 02:52:21,964
COULD THAT BE IT? 

5998
02:52:21,964 --> 02:52:22,932
IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE. 

5999
02:52:22,932 --> 02:52:24,634
COULD IT BE -- AND I THINK THAT 

6000
02:52:24,634 --> 02:52:26,436
WE'LL FIND -- COULD IT BE THAT 

6001
02:52:26,436 --> 02:52:28,504
HE'S AFFILIATED WITH SOME TYPE 

6002
02:52:28,504 --> 02:52:29,405
OF ORGANIZED GROUP? 

6003
02:52:29,405 --> 02:52:30,039
I BELIEVE THAT. 

6004
02:52:30,039 --> 02:52:33,209
I BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU 

6005
02:52:33,209 --> 02:52:34,210
LOOK SPECIFICALLY -- AND I'M 

6006
02:52:34,210 --> 02:52:36,512
NOT SAYING IT IS -- BUT WHEN 

6007
02:52:36,512 --> 02:52:37,914
YOU LOOK AT GANG VIOLENCE, IT'S 

6008
02:52:37,914 --> 02:52:39,515
NOT UNCOMMON WHERE GANG MEMBERS 

6009
02:52:39,515 --> 02:52:41,084
WILL DO EXACTLY WHAT THIS 

6010
02:52:41,084 --> 02:52:43,186
INDIVIDUAL DID TO PREVENT LAW 

6011
02:52:43,186 --> 02:52:43,920
ENFORCEMENT FROM IDENTIFYING 

6012
02:52:43,920 --> 02:52:45,922
THEM ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. 

6013
02:52:45,922 --> 02:52:49,058
SO THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE IT, 

6014
02:52:49,058 --> 02:52:54,063
BUT I TRULY BELIEVE WE'LL FIND 

6015
02:52:54,063 --> 02:52:55,698
THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS AFFILIATED 

6016
02:52:55,698 --> 02:52:57,433
WITH SOME TYPE OF ORGANIZED 

6017
02:52:57,433 --> 02:52:57,666
GROUP. 

6018
02:52:57,666 --> 02:52:59,235
IT JUST DOESN'T FIT WITH THE 

6019
02:52:59,235 --> 02:53:00,570
THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. 

6020
02:53:00,570 --> 02:53:02,538

6024
02:53:08,844 --> 02:53:09,178

6028
02:53:13,649 --> 02:53:17,754
WE WILL HOPEFULLY FIND MORE 

6029
02:53:17,754 --> 02:53:19,722
INFORMATION ON WHY THIS SUSPECT 

6030
02:53:19,722 --> 02:53:21,224
ENTERED THIS NEWSROOM AND 

6031
02:53:21,224 --> 02:53:21,557
OPENED FIRE.
