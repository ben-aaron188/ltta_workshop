1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
“There is now nowhere left
for you to hide, Larry.”

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,160
More than 160 women say Larry
Nassar sexually abused them.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,070
It’s one of the worst
sexual abuse scandals

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,050
in the history of sports.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,780
And it went on for 
more than two decades.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,220
How did he get away with it?

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,220
“My real interest, of course,
with dance and gymnastics

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,290
is my role with U.S.A. Gymnastics.”

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,170
Nassar had celebrity-like
status in the elite gymnastics

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,990
and sports medicine world.
U.S.A. Gymnastics gave him

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,070
countless awards.

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,130
He was inducted into Michigan
State University’s

13
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,130
hall of fame and governors appointed
him to state licensing boards.

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,000
He even secured a patent
for an ankle brace he invented.

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,020
Nassar’s patients felt honored

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,270
to be treated by 
the best of the best.

17
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,770
Nassar typically carried out

18
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,280
his abuse under the guise
of a medical treatment.

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,080
He hijacked a rare
pelvic therapy,

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,030
that involves
vaginal penetration,

21
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,900
and used it to treat
all sorts of ailments.

22
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,240
He ignored protocol, such as
using a glove, asking consent

23
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,440
or having a medical
chaperone present.

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,130
“And when I was 14 years old,

25
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,870
I tore my hamstring in my right leg.

26
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,010
This was when he started
performing the procedure

27
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,739
that we are all
now familiar with.”

28
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,969
“The next visit was for my shoulder,

29
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:10,389
which I then found out
my hips were out of alignment,

30
00:01:10,389 --> 00:01:13,299
which then made my spine
and my pelvic bone

31
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:15,639
out of alignment as well.

32
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:19,170
And this is when Larry decided
that it was medically acceptable

33
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,030
to violate a 16-year-old girl.”

34
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,580
When confronted by parents, coaches,
and eventually investigators,

35
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,300
Nassar said patients may have
misunderstood his therapy.

36
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,410
Medical colleagues
deferred to his expertise

37
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,500
After a 2014 investigation
cleared his name,

38
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,190
Nassar was just reminded
to follow procedures.

39
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,180
In the training camps
of elite gymnastics,

40
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,310
where coaches are 
notoriously hard on athletes,

41
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,520
Nassar manipulated girls
into believing he

42
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,550
was a trusted friend, advocate
and even their protector.

43
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,100
“You have to protect your athletes.

44
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,410
You have to let them know
that we care.

45
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,470
You have to, not let them know,
but let them feel it.

46
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,470
Let them understand it.
Let them breathe it.”

47
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07,190
”He put my picture up
on his wall with Olympians.

48
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,060
I thought I mattered
to Larry.”

49
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,860
“You had me so wrapped
around your finger,

50
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,000
and I still trusted you
so much.

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,970
Even when I was a sophomore
in college,

52
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,410
and you were the only
person I called

53
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,955
to help me make the
decision to end my

54
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:22,405
gymnastics career due
to my injuries.

55
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,900
Nassar won over family members
by offering a free treatment,

56
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,090
a quick diagnosis, or often
the pretense of transparency.

57
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,410
“At the end of the
appointment in your basement,

58
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,760
I remember asking, ‘Do
I owe you anything?’

59
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,530
Now it seems kind of sick.

60
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,480
You got what you wanted.”

61
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,610
He frequently molested
young girls with parents

62
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,580
in the room, using a
draped towel or practiced

63
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,430
positioning to conceal where
his fingers were massaging.

64
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,550
“What kind of a person
has the audacity

65
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,560
to sexually assault a child
in front of their mother?”

66
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,050
It’s still unclear
who knew what when,

67
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,730
but for decades
Nassar’s employers

68
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,650
focused on their
reputations and failed

69
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,550
to safeguard the young
women in their care.

70
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,240
When U.S.A. Gymnastics got a
complaint about Nassar in 2016,

71
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,350
the organization paid
the gymnast $1.25 million

72
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,000
to stop her from
speaking about the abuse.

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,430
Complaints about
Nassar’s treatments

74
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,610
reached officials at
Michigan State University

75
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,580
as early as 1997,

76
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,870
The Detroit News has
reported. That’s 20

77
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,540
years before the prized
doctor was terminated.

78
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,700
MSU has said that no
one at the University

79
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,270
believed that Nassar
committed sexual abuse prior

80
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,380
to the newspaper reports
in the summer of 2016.

81
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,170
Nassar’s victims say that if
the university had investigated

82
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,390
the first complaint,
scores of young girls

83
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,160
may have escaped
the doctor’s abuse.

84
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,200
“Larry Nassar did not
arise in isolation.

85
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,250
Rather we saw the worst sexual
assault scandal in history

86
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,120
unfold because a predator was
left in power for decades.

87
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,820
Despite warning signs,

88
00:03:59,820 --> 00:00:00,000
despite red flags, despite
direct reports of assault.”
