[Police Siren]

2
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,860
Right in the middle of a residential part of El Salvador,

3
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,480
this massive operation has been going on for years,

4
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,040
and it is estimated that there are over $30 million dollars

5
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,940
in fake currency

6
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,200
stashed in this one little place.

7
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,720
According to the US Secret Service,

8
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,020
Peru is the number one producer of counterfeit dollars in the world.

9
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,480
Criminal gangs have also been caught making millions

10
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,480
of Euros and fake Peruvian Soles.

11
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,660
That pickup truck over there is just loaded with boxes

12
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,340
with fake notes, like, probably millions

13
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,100
in fake notes.

14
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,780
And there's more and more and more being packed right there.

15
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,120
It's actually so heavy that the tires are deflating already.

16
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,760
The first Peruvian-made counterfeit dollar was detected in the United States back in 2003.

17
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,280
Since then, the illicit trade has grown exponentially.

18
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,800
Last year, US authorities identified just over 16 million fake dollars of Peruvian origin.

19
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,920
Widespread counterfeiting has the potential to undermine the value of the currency,

20
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,440
putting small business owners and unsuspecting US shoppers at risk.

21
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,740
We wanted to find out how easy it was to get hold of top-quality fake dollars.

22
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:35,940
Lima's old center and the notorious Azangaro Street are well known hubs for forgeries.

23
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:41,280
This is where we began the search for the best counterfeit dollar notes in the city.

24
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,300
After a few inquiries, we were introduced to Mario.

25
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:58,220
His eight minutes turned into two hours, so we decided to go for a ride, and then met him at different parking lot.

26
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,740
Despite the mutual edginess, we managed to finalize a deal.

27
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,860
The idea was to use this purchase as a starting point to develop a relationship with Mario.

28
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,160
These four $50 notes are the ones that the guy just gave us right now.

29
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,360
To my uneducated eye, these ones here -- the ones that we just got,

30
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,620
look actually of much better quality than this one, which is actually badly cut at the border.

31
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:28,960
And then of course there is this $100 note that the guy just gave us that doesn't look convincing at all.

32
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,600
So now it's time to test the notes we've got.

33
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:48,940
Along with Peru's local currency, US dollars are also widely accepted in many of Lima's shops and restaurants.

34
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,380
We went back to see Mario to tell him that the quality of the forgeries he sold us was not good enough.

35
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,020
He called a contact, whom he assured could get us better merchandise.

36
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,040
Mario went off to call some other contacts, but after the recent bust,

37
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,960
getting people from his network to start selling again was proving difficult.

38
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,620
We kept meeting up with Mario, who offered us different qualities of forged dollars.

39
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:08,640
Eventually, he came up what he described as the best counterfeit $100 bills on the market.

40
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,360
They actually did look very real. So we agreed to buy them.

41
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,460
I paid Mario the equivalent to 180 real US dollars for 2000 counterfeit ones.

42
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,060
The poorer areas on Lima's outskirts are the main hub for the production of counterfeit money.

43
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:44,900
Illegal printing facilities and safehouses where forgers worked are regularly busted by the police.

44
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,140
Police caught this gang trying to smuggle fake dollars into the US.

45
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,940
A liter is a slang term for $100,000 in counterfeit notes

46
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
We met with Mario again.

47
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,460
I wanted to know how I could smuggle the notes he had given us into the United States.

48
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:50,680
He said he had contact, a book binder who would conceal the notes inside the cover of a book.

49
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,600
I followed his advice and bought a book about Peruvian cocktails.

50
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:41,320
However, the day before we were due to meet the book binder, the police raided Azangaro Street.

51
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,400
The book binder was caught and arrested with dozens of forged documents.

52
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,140
A few days later, the book binder was released.

53
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,280
I suggested we meet at a hotel where we had installed secret cameras.

54
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,340
Mario and the book binder seemed rather uneasy on arrival, and looked around the room,

55
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,680
seemingly trying to spot hidden cameras.

56
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,820
We had managed to buy some of the best fake dollars on Lima's black market.

57
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:26,900
The high quality of the forgery is why Peru leads the world in counterfeit note production.

58
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,900
We wanted to find out how these notes are actually made.

59
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,020
We went to see Oscar, who works at a printing house in Lima.

60
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,060
He was going to demonstrate the first stage of forging a note -- the printing.

61
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:45,700
Cotton paper is hard to obtain, and is also considerably more expensive than bond paper.

62
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,100
We wanted to see for ourselves the finishing techniques used to make fake notes believable.

63
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,820
After months of chasing leads and meeting different counterfeiters,

64
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,420
finally we managed to convince an expert in the craft to let us film him at work.

65
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,400
This is the $20 note that he just finished,

66
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,860
and this is the one, an original one, and they do look pretty similar.

67
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,000
And they both have this texture he was explaining me about.

68
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,760
So this is it.

69
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,700
Lima's fake money.

70
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:53,920
Despite police efforts,  for each counterfeiter caught, dozens more remained undetected.

71
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:03,060
And even when caught, many forgers usually pay their way out of police custody, or serve lenient prison sentences.

72
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,660
With more and more people learning the skills required to forge a note,

73
00:21:08,020 --> 00:00:00,000
it's unlikely that the output of Peruvian fake dollars will stop anytime soon.
