1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Standing at the border between Guatemala
and Mexico.

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,400
Up there on the bridge,

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,969
there's a normal border crossing with
migration; people stamping passports, but

4
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,720
you go down these wobbly stairs, you
notice that right under the bridge these

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,300
guys are trafficking people across the
border, technically illegally.

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,380
You can't tell that there's been an immigration
crackdown here, but there has.

7
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,480
And it was the U.S. that paid for it.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,440
These guys are doing it under the noses of immigration

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,780
officials who clearly don't care that
much.

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,329
You only start to feel this

11
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,410
crackdown when you start moving north,
where you run into a new network of

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,560
military infrastructure and checkpoints
meant to stop migrants.

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,800
But this crackdown was never meant to keep
Central Americans out of Mexico, it was

14
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,600
meant to keep them out of Texas.

15
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,020
In 2014 the United States sent an influx of

16
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,740
money to Mexico, helping them militarize
and fortify their southern border region.

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,880
To understand why, you have to look at
this chart: the red line represents the

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,420
number of Mexican migrants apprehended
while they're crossing into the United States

19
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,759
and the green line is for non-Mexican
migrants. Look at 2014: that's when the

20
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,329
number of non-Mexican migrants
outnumbered Mexican migrants for the

21
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,740
very first time. What pushed this number up
were the migrants coming from

22
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,700
Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. And these people
fleeing from Central America aren't just

23
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,740
looking for jobs, they're running away.

24
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,240
So, there's a war going on in Central America

25
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,610
right now, it's actually not just
one war it's a ton of micro wars,

26
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,540
"Unbelievable violence." "Nearly one homicide an hour".

27
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,480
"Three of the five highest homicide countries in the world:

28
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,900
Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador."

29
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,620
"Carved up the city into warring factions".

30
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:09,439
Residents of these towns are

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,280
at major risk of dying and so people are
fleeing.

32
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,360
While riding with U.S. Border Patrol on the Texas border, I watched them apprehend a 22 year old and

33
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,320
his son as they just made the three-week
journey up through Mexico from Honduras.

34
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,160
These refugees walk into Mexico mostly
hoping to make it to the U.S.

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,820
Many come here, to this town called Tapachula, just
north of the border where they can look

36
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,940
for a migrant shelter to lie low and get
support and at this vulnerable point in

37
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,720
their journey, many don't want to show
their face on camera. And there were

38
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:05,000
these threats just constantly came and
came and came to me and then one day I

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,940
just said the hell with this I'm gone.
Mm-hmm. I burned my little Rancho and and

40
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,360
I took off at two o'clock in the morning.

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,380
The exodus out of Central America came

42
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,620
to a head in 2014, when the U.S. saw a huge spike in the

43
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,880
number of Central American kids and
teens arriving to the border without a parent.

44
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,080
"It is a huge humanitarian crisis
on the border right now".

45
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,540
"52,000 unaccompanied children have been caught
at the US border with Mexico: double the

46
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:35,900
number recorded last year". "Children from
Honduras traveling into Guatemala, then

47
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,640
Mexico, crossing the Rio Grande, and just
now arriving in Texas."

48
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,060
As soon as it became clear that this year's migration
to the border was different than in past

49
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:50,930
years, I directed FEMA to coordinate our
response at the border. Obama declared an

50
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,100
urgent humanitarian situation at the
border.

51
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,500
He discussed it with Mexican
president Peña Nieto.

52
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,140
Peña Nieto walked away from that meeting and
immediately implemented a policy called

53
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:08,180
"El Programa Frontera Sur", the southern
border program. "And earlier this week

54
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,170
Mexico announced a series of steps that
they're gonna take on their southern

55
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,980
border to help stem the tide".

56
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,760
For Peña Nieto, the plan had two main objectives:

57
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,900
In short, the plan was supposed to make

58
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,780
life better and safer for both migrants
and those living in the border region,

59
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:39,240
which includes Mexico's most
impoverished state, Chiapas.

60
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,580
This migrant protection plan for the southern border
had been in the works for years, but it

61
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,440
was rushed into implementation
apparently in response to American pressure.

62
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,560
Many of the long-term plans
that were meant to give migrants legal

63
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:54,830
support and protection fell away. Instead,
the implementation focused almost

64
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,600
entirely on enforcement and security.

65
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,070
"What's easiest to do, I think, is enforcement because

66
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,300
you already have the infrastructure set up.
Like it's harder to create jobs, right,

67
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,870
than it is to hire more immigration
agents to detain people."

68
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,590
Mexico's quick solution to this was to
militarize, to start raiding buses to

69
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,910
start putting up checkpoints, to start
cracking down on Central Americans who

70
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,569
are coming into their country. A perfect
symbolic representation of this are

71
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:26,759
these huge multi-agency complexes that
they built in order to house the

72
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:32,980
immigration officials alongside the Army,
and the Marines, and the Federal Police.

73
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,020
Mexico fortified its southern border
region and to help in the effort, the

74
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:41,580
U.S. sent an influx of money and
equipment, using resources from an

75
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,840
existing security partnership it had
with Mexico, dating back to 2007.

76
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,120
This partnership was originally created to
combat drug trafficking and organized crime.

77
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,199
The money was used here for things
like inspection equipment, k9 teams,

78
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,720
observation towers, training for
immigration enforcement officials,

79
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,380
communication networks to support
enforcement activities, and gear to

80
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,380
collect biometric data like fingerprints
and photos of detained migrants.

81
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,840
In short, the U.S. helped militarize the southern
border region of Mexico.

82
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,080
The U.S. got what it was looking for.

83
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,680
"In part because of strong efforts by Mexico

84
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:22,860
including at its southern border, we've
seen those numbers reduced back to much

85
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,180
more manageable levels."

86
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,199
Apprehensions on the Mexican side went up and people

87
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,940
arriving to Texas or other parts of the
U.S. border went down, but this was all

88
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:38,069
temporary. The number jumped back up in
2016, so the crackdown isn't actually

89
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:41,639
stopping people from getting to the
United States, but it is making their

90
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,260
journey much more dangerous.

91
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,220
Behind me is the train that Central
Americans take to get from here in

92
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,980
southern Mexico, up to the border of the
United States. If it were 2014 this area

93
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,600
would be completely packed with migrants.

94
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,870
Migration officials targeted this train.

95
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,470
They started conducting extensive raids
and the train companies hired guards,

96
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,700
increasing the speeds of the trains and
installing concrete posts and walls to

97
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,840
make it harder for people to jump aboard
and now gangs are a constant threat to

98
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,940
the few travelers that remain.

99
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,460
Here are the main routes that migrants took to

100
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:24,230
get to the United States: they mainly follow
the train routes. These paths were well

101
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,650
supported with migrant shelters and
clinics and most importantly large

102
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,280
groups of other migrants, making it less
likely that people will be robbed or

103
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,480
assaulted. Migrants often don't know
where their next meal will come from or

104
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,410
where they're gonna sleep each night.
They depend on this network of usually

105
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:44,330
church-sponsored shelters as they move
north. The 2014 crackdown targeted these

106
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,860
routes, looking for migrants in popular
places like shelters and train stops.

107
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,800
So migrants moving north have shifted into
unfamiliar, unsupported routes that

108
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,320
multiply the dangers that they are
already subject to on this journey.

109
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,660
Pushing these refugees away from well
trodden routes and into the shadows has

110
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,700
made them more vulnerable to assaults by
criminals and gangs in this region.

111
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,780
During this time the U.S. Border Patrol
started putting out public service

112
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,710
announcements, about how dangerous the
journey through Mexico had become.

113
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,300
This, in spite of the fact that U.S. policy
contributed to those risks.

114
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:28,000
All of the shelter directors I talked to have
noticed an uptick in crimes against

115
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,590
migrants since this crackdown. A study by
dozens of migration organizations in

116
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:37,690
Mexico found that, of the 5,824
investigations into crimes against

117
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,960
migrants, less than 1% had led to any
sort of sentence.

118
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,240
And many crimes go

119
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,530
unreported altogether. There's not a lot
of trust in the Mexican justice system

120
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:48,420
for migrants.

121
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,180
Most migrants are now left on their own,

122
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,600
navigating this remote
region where both gangs and corruption-prone

123
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,740
police are looking for ways to
profit off vulnerable migrants.

124
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,780
But perhaps the most egregious offence of the Mexican
state in this crackdown, comes down to

125
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,540
what they didn't do for these people
entering their country. When a Mexican

126
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,369
immigration official detains a migrant,
that officer is required to inform them

127
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:09,209
that they have the right to ask for
refugee status or asylum if they're

128
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:13,680
fleeing for their lives. Everyone I
talked to said that isn't happening.

129
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,240
There were 40,000 children who entered
into Mexico in 2016, and these children

130
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,060
aren't looking for jobs, they're not
smuggling drugs, they're looking for protection.

131
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,760
Of the 40,000 that came here,
only 1% applied for asylum.

132
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:32,520
That's a dangerously low number for a
country that has said that it protects asylum seekers.

133
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,399
Migrants who feel a threat to their lives in their own

134
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,809
country have to fill out an application
and submit it to an agency that has the

135
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:44,699
power to grant asylum or refugee status
in Mexico. This allows them to avoid

136
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:48,480
being deported, to stay in the country,
but this agency that's in charge of

137
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,740
processing these applications only had
15 caseworkers dedicated to interviewing

138
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,730
these applicants and while applications
are on pace to be 12 times what they

139
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,920
were in 2013, this group's budget only
grew 5% during the crackdown.

140
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,600
The year the southern border program was
implemented, Mexico detained around a

141
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,679
119,000 Central Americans. It granted refugee status to

142
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,420
only 460 of them, not
even a half a percent. That same year

143
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,709
Mexico started deporting a lot more
Central Americans, so the southern border

144
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:23,790
program made Mexico a lot better at
detaining and deporting people,  but it

145
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,360
definitely didn't make Mexico a safer
place for refugees like it said it would.

146
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,249
Now let's get one thing straight, Mexico
has the right and the sovereignty to

147
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:35,660
fortify its borders and to control who's
coming in and out.

148
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,500
That is their right as a sovereign nation.

149
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,730
And some will wonder why is it Mexico's

150
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:44,210
problem to deal with
you know the problems and challenges of

151
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:48,530
citizens of another country?
The problem is Mexico has signed all of

152
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:52,430
the international conventions that
promise that they will take care of

153
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:57,060
asylum seekers or refugees and give them
the legal protection so that they can feel safe.

154
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,940
A report by the Migration Policy institute found that in 2014,

155
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,880
The U.S. deported just 3 of every 100

156
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,090
unaccompanied children that it
apprehended on the border. Mexico on the

157
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:22,130
other hand deported 77 for every 100
kids it apprehended. And yet when

158
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:27,020
thousands of unaccompanied children
arrived at Texas' border in 2014 the U.S.

159
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,280
turned to Mexico to handle the delicate
and difficult work of screening and

160
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,300
protecting these refugees fleeing for
their lives. The U.S. is paying Mexico to

161
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:39,590
do its dirty work, knowing full well that
doing this will result in a much more

162
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,480
dangerous situation for refugees.

163
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,760
It drove them into the shadows, worsening their vulnerabilities.

164
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,860
And in most cases,

165
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,380
deporting them back to the violent places from which they came.

166
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,820
One of the questions I know I'm gonna get a ton is:

167
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,160
What is the name of this waterfall?

168
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,060
Southern Mexico's full of a lot of very beautiful scenery,

169
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:22,260
and I got to see a lot of it as I was traipsing around the region, reporting this story.

170
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:28,080
But this waterfall, it's called El Chiflón and it's in the state of Chiapas in Southern Mexico.

171
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,960
It ended up being one of the most beautiful things I'd ever seen,

172
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,360
in all of my Borders reporting this summer.

173
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,920
Especially once I got the drone up in the air and saw it from above.

174
00:14:37,360 --> 00:00:00,000
El Chiflón, in Chiapas. It's a beautiful place.
