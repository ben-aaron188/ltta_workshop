1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:05,290
At the height of the 2016 election researchers
released a report warning about a strange

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:06,390
propaganda technique.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,070
Another day, another lie, another conspiracy
theory, another falsehood.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,259
They called it the "firehose of falsehood."

5
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:16,920
When a propagandist bombards people with more
lies than they can possibly keep up.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,340
Why all these lies?

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,449
Why is it lie after lie after lie?

8
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:23,500
According to the report, these lies don't
have to be believable.

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,500
It wasn't just a lie.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,999
It was such a bad obvious lie.

11
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:31,760
Researchers found that even obvious lies had
the potential to be highly effective at shaping

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,759
public opinion.

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,790
I mean he just says things and then they are
the truth in the world of the Donald.

14
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,950
The thing is, that report wasn't about Trump.

15
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,100
It didn't even mention him.

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,590
It was about Russian propaganda.

17
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,000
And it raised an interesting question: How
could a powerful leader benefit from telling

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
obvious lies?

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,300
We've signed more bills than any president
ever.

20
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,040
The president just simply lies for no reason.

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,030
I was against the war in Iraq.

22
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,860
Why lie about something that you don't have
to lie about?

23
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,910
You have people registered in two states.

24
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:01,910
They vote twice.

25
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,010
Why does he keep repeating it if it's obviously
not true?

26
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,820
We're going to get to Trump in a minute.

27
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,820
Hell yeah!

28
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,610
But before that, we have to talk to Christopher
Paul.

29
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,640
I'm a senior social scientist at the RAND
Corporation.

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,060
He co-wrote the report on Russian firehosing
and he described it as having four key characteristics.

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,620
Russian propaganda is high volume and multichannel.

32
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,890
It's rapid, continuous, and repetitive.

33
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,580
It makes no commitment to objective reality.

34
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,280
And it makes no commitment to consistency.

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,530
Oooh, sounds like Trump.

36
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,670
Can you give me a second?

37
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,500
I'm building a narrative here.

38
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,060
The first two characteristics are pretty standard
for propaganda.

39
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,510
Research shows that if we hear a lie from
multiple sources, we think of it as more credible.

40
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,550
The same is true for lies we hear repeatedly.

41
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:46,090
The more familiar we are with a lie, the more
likely we are to think of it as true.

42
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:51,380
But the last two characteristics — no commitment
to objective reality or consistency — that's

43
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,380
surprising.

44
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,200
They don't care that much about the truth.

45
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,920
Much of their propaganda is either completely
false or has a kernel of truth.

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,340
Maybe the most jarring example this was in
2014, when the world watched as Russian troops

47
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,340
entered Ukraine.

48
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:12,609
There were a bunch of Russian soldiers wearing
uniforms without insignia and those were dubbed

49
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:13,609
“little green men.”

50
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:14,760
This was a huge deal.

51
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,540
Russia was essentially invading a country
they had said they were not going to invade.

52
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,389
But when Putin was asked about it:

53
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:22,319
Were these Russian soldiers?

54
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,319
No.

55
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,049
These were local self-defense forces.

56
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:26,590
Putin vehemently denied.

57
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,329
“No no, the little green men are not Russian
soldiers.”

58
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,200
It wasn't just that Putin was lying.

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,709
He was lying about something so obvious.

60
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:36,830
There was footage of the soldiers airing on
TV.

61
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,200
Russian troops spreading out throughout the
strategic Crimean Peninsula.

62
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,489
And then, a few weeks later, he just said
the opposite.

63
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:47,969
Of course, we had our servicemen.

64
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:51,340
They were acting very correctly.

65
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,470
No “I'm sorry.”

66
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,680
No “I misspoke.”

67
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,409
Just, “Of course we have troops there.”

68
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:56,709
This is counterintuitive.

69
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,219
This is not what I expected.

70
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:02,720
I come from an influence background that says
credibility is king and the truth will always

71
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
win.

72
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,909
Part of being a good liar is not getting caught.

73
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:08,709
Making sure your lies are at least somewhat
believable.

74
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:14,719
When Dick Cheney said, "There is no doubt
Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction,"

75
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,599
he was lying, but to most people who aren't
intelligence experts, it sounded credible.

76
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,510
If someone asks, "Hey did you eat my sandwich?"

77
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,510
You'd say, "Nope.

78
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,430
I brought my lunch from home."

79
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,069
You wouldn't say, "You never had a sandwich."

80
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:33,499
But when it comes the firehosing, believability
doesn't really matter.

81
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:38,590
I think being willing to not be seen as credible
is okay with the Russians.

82
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,590
We'll come back to this.

83
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,680
But right now it's

84
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,680
TRUMP TIME!

85
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,680
Trump time.

86
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,370
Since the election, people have pointed out
that Trump uses firehosing too.

87
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:51,859
I really had no view that this would be anything
that anyone would think about applying to

88
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:53,420
American politics.

89
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,480
That's not what I'm about.

90
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,969
I am concerned with foreign intervention in
our political processes.

91
00:03:58,969 --> 00:03:59,969
Okay, fine.

92
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:01,879
Donovan, bring in the second interview please.

93
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,599
Thank you.

94
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,769
I think it can be deceptive just how different
they look.

95
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:11,719
But despite the different styles, I think
they do the exact same thing.

96
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,909
This is Masha Gessen.

97
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:17,540
She's a Russian-American journalist, activist,
and all around badass.

98
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,069
And she's been warning about the similarities
between Trump and Putin for years.

99
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:27,170
They just create sort of this unmanageable
volume of falsehood.

100
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:31,990
Gessen argues that firehosing — telling
and retelling obvious lies — isn't about

101
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,500
persuasion.

102
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,530
It's about power.

103
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,350
When Putin says there are no troops in Crimea
or when Trump says he never mocked a disabled

104
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,550
reporter, they're not just lying.

105
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,780
They're asserting that they are not constrained
by reality.

106
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,830
That everything, even things that are totally
obvious to us, can be challenged.

107
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,680
That's a very clear demonstration of power.

108
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,789
You have to engage with what he said even
though it's false.

109
00:04:55,789 --> 00:05:00,491
Those last two features a firehosing — the
shamelessness, the inconsistency — they're

110
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:01,680
kind of the point.

111
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,509
The way that they lie that makes the obviousness
of the lie part of the powerplay.

112
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:12,490
Yes, I know that you know what I'm saying
is absurd, and I assert my right to say whatever

113
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,900
I want whenever I want to.

114
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,870
He keeps urinating on the sidewalk and we
have to keep wiping it up.

115
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,370
Not the sidewalk, the living room rug.

116
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,370
Yeah.

117
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,370
On the rug!

118
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,370
What are you cheering for right now?

119
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,699
Our knee-jerk reaction to lies like this is
to fact-check them.

120
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,560
Fact checkers are having a field day with
this one.

121
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,599
President Obama did not found ISIS.

122
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:34,050
He was not wiretapped, there was no warrant
out.

123
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,039
It is not the biggest tax cut in US history
as the fact-checkers have noted.

124
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,669
But if the goal of firehosing is to assert
power, fact-checking misses the point.

125
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:48,599
There is nothing quite so humiliating and
disempowering as trying to prove the truth.

126
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:51,610
Think of a schoolyard bully who says, "Why
are you hitting yourself?

127
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,910
Why are you hitting yourself?"

128
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,659
Degrading you by forcing you to argue with
the obvious.

129
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,330
"Why are you hitting yourself?

130
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,330
Why are you hitting yourself?"

131
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,330
Yeah, you'd know about being bullied.

132
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,330
I sure would.

133
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,330
Thank you.

134
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,120
And I think that's kind of what it feels like
when we fact-check Trump.

135
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,169
It's sullying.

136
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:10,550
You feel like you've engaged with something
that actually shouldn't be a part of the public

137
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,550
sphere.

138
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:16,360
Firehosing turns even the most obvious of
facts into a messy, mind-numbing political

139
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
fight.

140
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,159
Every time he gets fact-checked Trump lashes
out.

141
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:22,520
They just don't want to report the truth.

142
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,909
Sarah Sanders blames the media.

143
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:29,330
If anything has been inflamed it's the dishonesty
that often takes place by the news media.

144
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,949
And something that should not have even been
up for debate starts to look like just another

145
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:36,580
screaming match where no one really seems
credible.

146
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,590
Donald Trump lies and he lies compulsively.

147
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:49,370
So this very simple human assumption that
you can know what's true, that assumption

148
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,560
is taken away from you.

149
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,710
You have to work for the truth and the hope
is that, yeah, you'll get exhausted and you'll

150
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,810
eventually give up.

151
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:56,810
I'm getting depressed.

152
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,810
I know, buddy.

153
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,080
I'm almost done.

154
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,330
We're all almost done.

155
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:04,539
The ultimate goal of firehosing isn't to pass
lies off as truth.

156
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:08,969
It's to rob concepts like facts and reality
of their power.

157
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:10,439
You stand by that claim about him?

158
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,439
I don't stand by anything.

159
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,780
I have my own opinions, you can have your
own opinions.

160
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,510
To reduce truth to just a position.

161
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,389
Isn't it important just to, like, have factual
debates when discussing these things?

162
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:23,490
Well, as you just commented, there's lots
of different ways of looking at it.

163
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,699
You're saying it's a falsehood and they're
giving alternative facts.

164
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:28,391
It's somebody's version of the truth, not
the truth.

165
00:07:28,391 --> 00:07:29,740
Truth is truth.

166
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,389
I don't mean to go like...

167
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:32,530
No it isn't truth.

168
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,530
Truth isn't truth.

169
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,610
And if that sounds a little abstract, just
listen to what Putin said during his press

170
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,669
conference with Trump in July.

171
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:42,789
As to who is to be believed, you can trust
no one.

172
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:46,050
He defends the interests of the United States
of America.

173
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,919
And I do defend the interests of the Russian Federation.

174
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:52,879
So Putin just basically wanted to establish
as a baseline that no one can be trusted.

175
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,729
Everybody's pursuing their own strategic interests
and there's no such thing as the truth.

176
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:59,599
And a few days later Trump took that argument
a step further.

177
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,990
And just remember, what you're seeing and
what you're reading is not what's happening.

178
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,120
Just stick with us.

179
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,039
Don't believe the crap you see from these
people, the fake news.

180
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:13,569
Just stick with us.

181
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:16,189
Essentially, reality is about picking sides.

182
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:20,499
They're basically saying there's no war between
people who know the truth and people who are

183
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:21,499
lying.

184
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:22,650
There's only positional warfare.

185
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,310
Whoever has a better position.

186
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,940
Whoever has objectively more power owns reality.

187
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,669
And it's remarkable how effective that is.

188
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:36,970
Maybe you can just start acting like you have
total power and it will not exactly give you

189
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:41,289
total power but it will give you a hell of
a lot more power than an American president

190
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:45,580
should have.

191
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,060
You never had a sandwich.

192
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,100
You never had a...

193
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,500
Come on man, you're killing me.

194
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,224
Don't look at him if you don't have to.

195
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:58,820
You never had... we have to unmic him.

196
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,820
All right.

197
00:08:59,820 --> 00:00:00,000
You're off the set.
