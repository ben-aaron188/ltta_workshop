slash bet well it is important to note
that in the aftermath of the Brett
Kavanaugh saga Republicans have been
gaining ground across the board in the
Senate in the house things still are way
too close to call it is not clear at
this point that Republicans lose the
house although the smart money suggests
that they probably will
with that said all the Senate polls that
have come out since the Brett Kavanaugh
saga have been terrible for Democrats
I'm talking about martha mcsalley in
arizona who was down five to seven
points in that race suddenly is up six
points
according to a new poll which is
wonderful because martha mcsalley will
be quite a good senator from the state
of arizona in tennessee the state in
which I currently sit that state has now
turned strongly toward Marsha Blackburn
Phil Bredesen on the heels of a Taylor
Swift endorsement has fallen plummeted
in the polls he is now down to the 30s
according to some polls and Marsha
Blackburn has pulled convincingly into
the league Claire McCaskill remains
extraordinarily vulnerable in Missouri
so it looks like Republicans could in
fact in this election lose seats in the
house and pick up some significant seats
in the Senate which makes a big
difference because it means that if you
have a four or five vote majority in the
Senate next time Republicans have a
judicial pick if Ruth Bader Ginsburg
retires for some reason or if God forbid
something happens to her health-wise
well then Republicans will have the
opportunity to replace her with a strong
conservative a strong textualist most
importantly like Amy Kony Barrett which
would be just unreal and that's a
significant possibility if the elections
go the way they seem to be going right
now now the reason that this shift has
happened is not because of President
Trump it's not because of the
Republicans it is simply because the
Democrats have bared their fangs the
Democrats have decided that they are
going to look as ugly and terrible as
humanly possible in public as often as
possible it's so funny because the
Democrats after after losing to
President Trump decided that what they
really needed to do was be more
off-putting they look at President Trump
and they see that his popularity ratings
are in the low 40s and I thought well
you know what if we could imitate that
but do it worse right so he won't have
the the kind of blue-collar appeal of
President Trump we won't have these sort
of personal charisma of President Trump
will just be insanely off-putting and
terrible all the time maybe that will
win us power again and it doesn't seem
like it is working the media are doing
their best to try and cover for this so
you have this conflict that is now
happening is gas lighting that is
happening where Democrats are openly
stating openly that they are in favor of
mob politics that they are fine with mob
politics they're fine with people
showing up at restaurants and yelling at
people they are fine with people trying
to beat down the 13-ton bronze doors at
the Supreme Court they are fine with
folks screaming at senators and
elevators they are fine with all of
these things all these things are just
dandy and then you have folks in the
media saying no no Democrats aren't
saying that there are no mobs that's
nothing that's not real why would you
think
the mob stuff is real and those of us
with the brain are going well because
Democrats said so out loud repeatedly
and then the folks in the media - no no
no no no you're not allowed to listen to
what Democrats say the only mobs that
exist are republican mobs and where we
say well name them and they say well
Charlottesville is like well no that's
not a Republican Bob what are you even
talking about in any case let's begin
today with Hillary Rodham Clinton who
will not go away she is like just a bad
case of genital herpes she just will not
leave and she remains on the political
scene really torturing everyone Democrat
and Republican I'm not sure they're that
many Democrats who are extraordinarily
excited about Hillary Clinton still
being around again there's a basic
principle in American politics which is
that after you lose a presidential
election we really don't want to hear
from you pretty much ever again Hillary
Clinton however does not know this rule
so she continues to appear in the media
and say silly things what you have to
love about Hillary Clinton I really mean
that so you have to love about her is
that she's utterly transparently
mechanical it's like we're moving the
face of a clock you can see all the
gears working in real time so for
example yesterday she was on CNN and
choose asked specifically about civility
now we all know that Hillary is nothing
nicest human being and that's that's not
a great shock but Hillary was also the
person who kept saying during the 2016
election every time they go low we go
high when they go low we go high right
now that was her routine during the 2016
election well now she's changed her tune
why is she changed her tune because she
realizes that the passion of the base is
not with civility the passion of the
base is not with decency the passion of
the bases with yelling and screaming and
kicking on the floor like my two and a
half year old son when I tell him he's
not allowed to push em away at school
right that's that's how the Democratic
base is responding to the latest round
of politics she knows that and so
Hillary being transparently manipulative
and political has started to try to
personality mayor now there are certain
people in our office I won't name names
like Michael Knowles who are excellent
at personality mirroring this is just
something that they do it's like a
natural quality if you talk to Michael
Knowles and you are jovial he will be
jovial if you talked to Michael moles
and you're in a bad mood he will be in a
bad mood Michael Moses has a unique
capacity to mirror human personality
it's one of the things that makes him
roguishly likable as they
mirrors personality quite well well
Hillary Clinton is really bad at it
Hillary Clinton tries to do it but fail
so she's supposed to be trying to sort
of encompass the rage of her own base
here but it's so mechanical that you can
see all the gears moving and sort of
delightful to see all the gears moving
because you can see once again why she
lost
here's Hillary Clinton explaining that
Democrats should not be civil with
Republicans that's the time for civility
is over which makes you wonder when was
the time for civility not over and I was
here for the Obama administration when
the IRS was militarized against
conservative 501c3 groups I was here for
the Obama administration when they were
cramming down a horrific Iran deal and
that put our allies in danger and then
lying to the American public about it
and then chortling over line I was here
for the Obama years when Barack Obama
went out in public and made excuses for
rioting in Ferguson in Baltimore
so I'm not sure what Hillary Clinton is
talking about when she says the era of
civility is over but here is Hillary
Clinton saying we don't need to be civil
anymore because we disagree with
Republicans and why would you be civil
with people with whom you disagree you
cannot be civil with a political party
that wants to destroy what you stand for
what you care about that's why I believe
if we are fortunate enough to win back
the house and/or the Senate that's when
civility can start again so in victory
civility so civility can start again
when we dominate you and put our boot on
your throat that's when civility makes a
comeback now what's funny about this is
that her premise that you can't be civil
to a party that wants to destroy all the
things that you stand for that's the
premise of party politics in the United
States there's not a lot unifying the
Democratic and Republican parties right
now they both want to destroy what the
other party stands for that does not
remove the requirement to be civil now I
think Republicans understand this much
better than Democrats do or at least did
until 2016 the the great untold story of
the last 25 years is that Democrats
categorized every Republican as evil and
nasty and bigoted and homophobic and
racist and all of these terrible things
and finally Republicans responded in
2016 by saying you know what screw you
two we're done and I have a chart to
prove it so here's a chart from jonathan
heights new book about polarization in
American politics and here's what it
shows it's part
hatred before the other party and you
will see that the lighter line if you're
watching this you can see the lighter
line shows that you they folks who hate
the Democratic Party Republicans who
hate the Democratic Party and the darker
line shows Democrats who hate the
Republican Party what you will see is
that until 2016 Democratic hate for the
Republican Party was higher or equal to
hate from Republicans for Democrats
every year since 1980
right that's the actual trend line here
what you see in this trend line is that
since 1980 when Ronald Reagan won
election Democratic hatred for the
Republican Party skyrocketed and was
significantly higher than Republican
hatred for the Democrats all the way up
until 1995 or so then they sort of drew
even and they basically are right on top
of each other and then after george w
bush was elected then democratic hatred
for the republican party skyrocket again
and remained higher this is the part
that's amazing it remained higher than
hatred for the Democratic Party by
Republicans all the way until 2016 which
means even after Barack Obama was
elected Democrats still hated
Republicans more than Republicans hated
Democrats which shows you that
Republicans in the end really believe I
think they believe and I believe this
for decades that Democrats are wrong but
not evil and Democrats believe that
Republicans are both wrong and evil and
in 2016 Republicans finally said listen
you guys think that we're evil well that
makes you evil we're done with this
right you're gonna say that you hate us
just for partisan reasons well we hate
you right back
you can go shove it we are not
interested in playing this game with you
anymore that's what's happened so the
media only noticed this around 2016
because the media are partisan Democrats
the folks in the media only noticed that
Republican hatred for Democrats had
skyrocketed in 2016 because for the
first time it was evident that that was
the case because until then Democratic
hatred for Republicans always had
exceeded Republican hatred for Democrats
and the media were part of that problem
the media were forwarding that hatred
the media were cheering it on it was the
media declaring that George W Bush was a
war criminal it was the media declaring
that the Tea Party were a bunch of
terrorists whose the media declaring
that the Tea Party were a bunch of mob
thug accuracy fans right this was that
this was their claim and then in 2016
Republicans won partial
by saying okay fine we will activate the
hatred within right they'll fall for the
Emperor's trick in Return of the Jedi
well let the hate flow through us and it
would make us powerful and to a certain
extent it did Democrats thinking that
they are going to somehow win by
escalating the amount of hatred in their
hearts again is a pretty astonishing
thing now we're gonna talk about how the
media is gaslighting everybody on this
issue in just one second but first let's
talk about those credit card bills so
here is the reality you've been racking
up credit card bills or maybe it
happened and the credit card at the
rates on those credit card bills are
exorbitant if you've been racking up
credit card bills and you're paying
interest rates that are 20 30 % because
you have been able to pay off those
bills maybe it's time to consolidate
that debt or pay off your credit cards
with one fixed monthly payment and
that's where Lending Club comes in
they've helped millions of people regain
control of their finances with
affordable fixed-rate personal loans no
trips to a bank no high interest credit
cards just go to Lending Club com tell
them about yourself how much you want to

lender go check it out right now Lending
Club com / Bend consolidate that debt
put yourself on firmer fiscal footing
Lending Club com / been and let them
know that we sent you with that / better
okay so as I say the Democrats have
decided to let the hate flow through
them in order to defeat the Republicans
failing to recognize that it was
Democratic hatred for Republicans that
activated Republicans in the first place
and this is the part that's ironic the
Democrats think by being more militant
by being more angry that they're going
to get their base riled up and then
they're going to sweep back into power
well they showed how militant and angry
they could be over the last two weeks
and guess what happened in all the
battleground Senate polls they lost
ground because Republicans looked at
that they said oh I remember why I was
scared of you I remember why I was angry
at you and Here I am I'm back and we're
gonna vote this time around well mazie
Hirono is joining the party she along
with Hillary Clinton is now a big fan of
all of this mob sort of stuff I like the
train noise in the background it really
an ambient feel to this this whole show
the momentum of a train moving forward
hey case
here's mazie Hirono senator from Hawaii
talking about how there's a mob is that
really bad because I mean the
Republicans are all white supremacists
anyway so why not mob them well this is
what happens you know they because when
you look at white supremacist and all
that this is what's coming forth in our
country there's a tremendous divisive
nests in our country but this is the
kind of activism that occurs and people
make their own decisions if they violate
the law then they have to come for that
okay so fun to hear Democratic senators
openly state that they don't really care
about this sort of mob tactic now the
funny part is that the media have
decided the media may be smarter than
the Democrats in all this the Democrats
think they can activate the base and the
media think they can tamp down
Republican response by pretending that
none of this is happening so as the mob
is activated as folks at the Women's
March and folks at the ACLU and folks in
the Democratic halls of power start
saying that it's okay to railroad a guy
without any due process and then to
activate mobs to go and and storm the
the Senate building and go and storm the
Supreme Court as they sell this the
medium maintained over and over that you
shouldn't believe your eyes who's gonna
believe down lemon or your own eyes who
are you gonna believe
who are you going to believe Brooke
Baldwin or your own lying eyes and this
is the way they approach this so last
night on CNN Matt Lewis and Mary
Katharine ham both friends of mine and
both Republicans are on with Brooke
Baldwin and they're talking about
President Trump who is labeled
democratic politics mob politics which
it is at this point listen to Brooke
Baldwin try to spin away I mean it's
amazing
listen her try to spin away the fact
that mobs invaded the heart Senate
building and tried to intimidate people
and then went to the sand when went to
the Supreme Court tried to beat in the
doors here is here is Brooke Baldwin
Brooke Baldwin doing her best to guess
like the American people oh it's totally
a mob it is without a doubt there's no
other word for us it's a good put up a
mob stop stop put on a mob is what we
saw in Charlottesville Virginia
two August's ago now a mob
it's what we saw chasing I'm gonna tell
you what they did we right what about
the people who were at the Supreme Court
banging on the walls what do you call
that civil protest or that a mob I think
it's easily a mom and there's Brooke
ball and putting her head in her hands
how could someone call this a mob why
would anyone call it because it's a mob
that's why there's there's an article in
The Washington Post saying Republicans
tried to recast Democratic protest as
mob I'll have to recast anything and
didn't take a lot of work at all it said
something like Republicans work hard to
do it doesn't take any work at all
because all we have to do is show you
the video show you the pictures it's not
just Brooke Baldwin
a lot of the anchors on CNN have
dedicated themselves to the idea that
the only sort of mob that's real is a
mob of white supremacists in Charlotte
so if the only mob we've seen in
politics really we didn't see mobs in
Ferguson we didn't see mobs in Baltimore
we haven't seen mobs in at the Supreme
Court we didn't see mobs at the Senate
building none of this was a mob
occupy what those weren't mobs the only
mobs are right-wing mobs and if you feel
like people are driving you nuts that
they're gaslighting you in line do
that's because they are
take for example Don Lemon so Don Lemon
last night he had on a GOP commentator
named Alice Stewart and she was talking
about President Trump who's ripping on
the Democrats is an angry left-wing mob
and here is how it went down so lemon
said so so Alice Stewart said that
calling these folks a mob was actually
accurate pointing to people who are
banging on the doors of the Supreme
Court and people who harassed senator
Cruz and Heidi Cruz as well as yelling
at Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and
elevators and lemon said but that
doesn't mean people don't get to object
that's your right as an American to
object it's covered in the First
Amendment it's like the first one and
then Louis again chimed in and argued
that anti cabinet protesters engaged in
my behavior which they did they went
into the actual Cavanaugh Senate hearing
room and they screamed until they were
removed they shouted until they were
moved that's called mob behavior okay so
lemon says no that's not mob behavior
it's people who are upset and they're
angry with the way the country is going
those two things are not mutually
exclusive
mobs typically are angry and upset with
the way a country is going the reason
the media are trying to cover for all
this is because the media are beginning
to realize that shouting at Republicans
is not actually the best strategy for
winning and so they're simply going to
try to convince you
that the person who is shouting in your
ear is not real it's like Harvey the
bunny the giant bunny
it's just imaginary it exists only in
your imagination it's not a real thing
so the media doing their best to try and
tamp down the perception of the public
that Trump is actually correct about all
of this and the Republicans are right
when they say it Mitch McConnell of
course is pushing this forward Mitch
McConnell says listen this behavior and
this this Hillary Clinton comment about
civility being out of bounds
this is unhinged stuff from the
Democrats and that of course is correct
no peace until they get their way more
of these unhinged tactics apparently
this is the left rallying cry but
fortunately the American people know
that the fact free politics of hate fear
and intimidation are not how we actually
govern in our democratic republic well
this is right I mean the Democrats
acting like pure aisle children is not
going to help them and that's why the
media are trying to convince you that's
not actually what's going on Rand Paul
got himself in a little bit of Twitter
hot water yesterday for comments that he
made that are exactly correct he said
that political assassinations could rise
in the United States somebody could be
killed thanks to all of this vile
rhetoric on the part of folks like
Hillary Clinton now listen I'm somebody
go back and listen who condemned this
sort of aggressive rhetoric from
President Trump in 2016 in 2016 the
presidents of the United States when he
was just a candidate when he was going
to rallies and saying something like
punched somebody and I'll pay your legal
bills when he was doing that sort of
stuff I said that's bad that's ugly he
shouldn't be doing it well Democrats are
the ones doing it today and it's just as
bad it's just as bad and they're being
more explicit about it too I mean when
Hillary Clinton says civility is not
required with anybody on the other side
of the aisle it's pretty damn explicit
Rand Paul says this sort of stuff is
going to get somebody killed doesn't
mean that Hillary Clinton is gonna get
somebody killed but the rise in
temperature is likely to reach a boiling
point at some point here Rand says this
he gets all sort of flat all sorts of
flat for it I feel that there's going to
be an assassination I really worry that
someone is going to be killed and that
those who are ratcheting up the the the
conversation
those who are ratcheting up saying
getting their face they have to realize
that they bear some responsibility of
this elevates to violence now people are
saying well what about Trump
what about Trump okay let's talk about
ran for a second since Rand is one who's
making the comment Rand Paul had six of
his ribs broken by a neighbor who
allegedly didn't like his politics and
literally just tackled him on his
property requiring months and months of
recovery Rand Paul also happened to be
one of the people present at the
Congressional baseball game where a
bunch of Congress people were shot at
and Steve Scalise was nearly murdered so
I think that ran actually does have a
certain amount of credibility on this
particular issue what the direction the
country is going is a really ugly
direction and it's got to be stopped one
of the ways to stop that I think is
gratitude now I know I know this is a
word that has gone out of style
gratitude why should we be grateful
clearly things are so bad in America
except things are not bad in America
right now
things are very far from bad in America
right now in just a second I want to
explain to you that not only are things
not bad in America things have not been
bad in America for a few decades here
and all of the political motivation to
try and drive us to anger and panic is
completely overstated but first let's
talk about your impending doom since
we're in a dark mood let's talk about
your impending death you're gonna die
you're gonna plotz and let's just face
that reality now prepare for that
eventualities

actually on Twitter was in the email
from a guy who said that he wanted to
behead me which was which was kind of a
unique email I wrote on Twitter a good
morning to you too sir but yeah that's
when people say they're afraid of the
way politics is going yeah I don't think
that that is completely out of bounds
with that said the solution to that is
to be kind of grateful for the country
in which you live it's hard to be angry
at somebody when you when you're also
being grateful and we should be grateful
one of the great wise that's been
perpetrated by both sides of the
political aisle for political purposes
over the last several years has been
this lie that nothing in the United
States has gotten better since 1979
and very often folks particularly on the
Left these days like to suggest that
wage stagnation has taken place since
1979 and the American people are worse
off for the globalization liberalisation
liberalizing trade rules lower taxes
that these sorts of things the these
sorts of things have killed the American
economy that if we had just remained a
high tariff nation with less free trade
then we would all be living better but
wage stagnation has led to tremendous
suffering in the United States there's
only one problem I'd like to ask you you
listening right now do you think that
your lifestyle would have been better in
1979 really these two things don't match
up folks who say that 1979 was so
awesome the wage stagnation started then
and then and then wages have declined
ever since or they've at least remained
static
ever since for most people yes but you
are living a better lifestyle on those
same wages so what could explain this
conundrum well I think this is the most
important article of the day it's by a
woman in Marianne l2p at human progress
org and here is what she says she says
according to a 2015 report by the
Economic Policy Institute which is a
left wing think-tank based in DC ever
since 1979 the vast majority of American
workers have seen their hourly wages
stagnate or decline this is despite real
GDP growth of 149 percent and net
productivity growth of 64% over this
period in short the potential has
existed for ample broad-based wage
growth over the last three-and-a-half
decades but these economic gains have
largely bypassed the vast majority now
it is certainly true that average hourly
earnings of production and
on supervisory employees in the private
sector have barely changed between 1979
and 2015 in October 1979 average hourly
earnings stood at 651 or 2120 in 2015
dollars if you adjust for inflation in
2015 average hourly earnings stood at
about 21 bucks and 18 cents which is
slightly below the inflation adjusted
1979 level but we are forgetting three
important factors and this is the reason
that you are living better today is the
reason you have better stuff it's the
reason you have a bigger house it's the
reason why your lifestyle is
significantly better than it was in 1979
one expansion of non-wage benefits
people get all sorts of benefits that
are not wage related in today's economy
second a massive fall in the price of
consumer goods if you are making the
same amounts of money that you made last
year but all the goods are half as
expensive you can buy more of the goods
then it seems pretty intuitive if you
can buy more stuff why do you care what
the number is on your wage what matters
is whether you can trade that wage for
more things and there's also been a rise
in the price of services like education
and health care those three factors
combined to suggest that the problems in
our economy have to do with government
regulation not deregulation education
and health care are heavily regulated
and to suggest that trade has been quite
good for an enormous number of Americans
even if it feels like it has not been so
here's what this article suggested human
progress and this is right in recent
decades non-wage benefits expanded today
they include relocation assistance
medical and prescription coverage vision
and dental coverage health and dependent
care flexible spending accounts
retirement benefit plans group term life
and long term insurance plans legal and
adoption assistance plans child care and
transportation benefits vacation sick
paid time off it's not easy
rights this author Mary Ann topi it's
not easy to put an exact figure on the
value of those non-wage benefits but
they could amount to as much as 30 or
even 40 percent of the workers earnings
so while hourly wage benefits may have
stagnated the hourly wages may have
stagnated benefits certainly have not
the lion's share of non-wage benefits as
Cato's peter van horne wrote in 2011 is
consumed by the dramatic increase in
health insurance costs
he says the fixed cost of health
insurance are a much larger percentage
of the total compensation of lower
earnings workers meaning that you did
get a raise just came
your health insurance also many perhaps
most big-ticket items used by a typical
American family on a daily basis have
decreased in price so they looked at the
at human progress they looked at the
prices of common household items is
advertised in the 1979 Sears catalog and
prices of those common household items
sold by Walmart in 2015 and remember
those products in 2015 are a hell of a
lot better than the products in 1979 a
washing machine made in 2015 is a better
quality washing machine than a washing
machine made in 1979 a car made today is
a better car than a car made in 1979 all
the products are getting are better and
you're getting them for cheaper here's
what they did they divided the 1979
nominal prices by 1979 average nominal
hourly wages and 2015 nominal prices by
2015 average nominal hourly wages and
they calculated the time cost of
household items in each year that's the
number of hours it would take to buy a
washing machine for example so for
example the time cost of a 13 cubic foot
refrigerator fell by 52% in terms of the
hours of work required at the average
hourly nominal wage so if you could buy
two refrigerators for the price of one
that makes you richer regardless of what
your top-line income is needless to say
the above price reductions greatly
underestimate the totality of welfare
gains by the average American ignoring
qualitative aesthetic and environmental
improvement son commonly used items
again those products are better today
than they were yesterday so it's pretty
clear it is pretty clear that when it
comes to products that we can buy we are
much better off than they were in the
1970s so where are we short or short in
education health care and housing
because the cost of those things has
risen at a faster pace than total
compensation however it is true that
today's houses are larger and healthcare
is better and education is more
high-tech it is also true that the
reason that house that houses have risen
in price is because of tremendous
regulation on the part of Democratic
administrations for the most part in
major cities the reason that you see
housing shortages in Los Angeles which
is the most sprawling city now in in the
country means where I live is because of
heavy regulation and zoning so what is
the standard of living
well it's certainly it's certainly
better than it was in 1979 for the vast
majority of people in the American
public
the average part
is bigger the average stuff you have in
your apartment is bigger the average
house is better the average stuff that
you have in that house is better all of
that should suggest that maybe we should
be kind of grateful for the country in
which we live and stop trying to tear it
down and stop trying to tear each other
apart in the name of some utopian vision
and Democrats might be wise to start
there especially because the more
enraged Democrats get Republicans lag
behind because we are not fond of the
rage but if you enrage us when you awake
that sleeping giant it's not good for
you elect orally it is not good for you
okay well in just a second I want to
talk about the Democrats failure to
recognize that basic truth and what they
are saying now about justice Cavanaugh
but first let's talk about your coffee

speaking of the democratic lack of
gratitude for the country in which they
live which is driving a lot of anger on
a talk in a second about a song that has
now gone viral on Twitter and Facebook

will see you in just a second on the
other side of this this Facebook break
where the largest fastest-growing
conservative podcast in the nation
okay so let's talk about the fact that
the left doesn't seem to realize they
live in a great country and that they
believe that we all ought to be living
in fear every single day now
fear-mongering is never a wonderful
thing if you're willing to get exorcised
about problems in your life you probably
should be exorcised about problems that
are truly prevalent you know things that
are actually a threat to you and
suggesting that every woman in the
country is at risk of rape every second
of every day is probably not a good way
to bring people together it's also not a
good way to view your neighbors because
the truth is that women are not at risk
of sexual assault every day in the
United States America is a pretty safe
country for women in fact it's the
freest safest country for women in the
history of mankind so there's that but
there's a song that's now become very
popular on Twitter and Facebook I'm not
sure what her name is Mercedes Linz
I guess and she has put up this song and
folks on the Left are just ecstatic
about this song because it suggests that
men should not be concerned about false
allegations of sexual assault we should
not be concerned about it anymore so you
know men who are worried that in the
aftermath of the Brett Kavanaugh
nonsense that anybody can be accused at
any time without any corroborating
evidence they should sit down and shop
because women have it tough now there's
a logical flaw at the root of this which
is two things can be true once women can
be afraid of bad men and men can be
afraid of bad women why these two things
are supposedly mutually exclusive is
beyond me I do not understand why saying
that women have a right to be afraid
when a man cost them and treats them
terribly why is that mutually exclusive
with a man has a right to be afraid that
a woman will make a false allegation
against him I'm not saying that the
fears ought to be equivalent in nature
I'm not saying that the level of fear
should be equivalent or that the level
of prevalence of these events is
equivalent but to say that I shouldn't
be afraid of something bad happening to
me because something bad could happen to
you makes no sense at all just on a
logical level and the reason I say this
is because there are cases many cases
across the United States particularly on
campus right now where men are being
accused of things that they did not do
and it's costing them time money and
credibility so here's the story of James
I'm sorry James then we're gonna get
into this lady's song so James was a
freshman at the University of
california-davis this is according to
Reason magazine he was on his way to
math class when he received an email
that would derail his life for the next
few months the University
title nine office which handles sexual
misconduct disputes between students was
investigating a complaint against him
this was in February 2018 right after
Harvey Weinstein and Al Franken and all
the rest James said this was not a good
time to get accused of something like
this the email from the title nine
compliance officer when it's a great
detail about the seriousness of James
situation he would be investigated in
accordance with university sexual
assault and sexual violence policies as
well as the Student Code which covers
physical assault threats of violence and
conduct that threatens health and safety
a finding of responsibility could result
in suspension or even expulsion but the
email was short on details of the
alleged conduct according to the title
nine office a female student in Becky
had complained it that James touched her
on the breasts and buttocks over and
under her clothing without her consent
James knew Becky they've been classmates
in drama and briefly friends on the
evening of October 20th 2017 they'd met
up with some other friends to play music
eventually finding themselves alone in
Becky's dorm they kissed for a few
minutes and engaged in some light sexual
touching before other students
interrupted them in James's view the
encounter had not only been fully
consensual it was also mutual Becky bore
just as much responsibility for
initiating it as James as Becky would
later make clear to the investigator
she'd also touched him sexually
she explicitly described her own actions
in her official statement James's
attorney wrote about the incident and
and here's what they wrote
Becky's accounts of the incident as set
forth in the summary of her
investigative interviews does not on its
face allege any act of prohibited
conduct doesn't matter the investigation
continued until May first
at which time the office of student and
judiciary affairs finally concluded that
James was innocent even so Becky was
afforded the opportunity to appeal the
decision
consistent with University policy is
dictated by the Obama administration's
Education Department it cost James
twelve thousand dollars in legal fees to
defend himself against an allegation in
which the girl admitted admitted that
she was mutually involved in the sexual
conduct I mean it's pretty astonishing
according to Becky's complaint the
kissing followed a night of mutual
flirting and started out romantic
eventually she either asked James to
close the door closed it herself
they continued kissing and also touching
as they grinded against each other and
he stayed he says my hands started
making my way up
back slowly respectfully testing the
waters James opened his eyes to make
sure Becky was enjoying what was
happening she seemed into it and so he
touched her over her clothes
James removed his shirt and she told him
to drop it on the floor so in other
words she was involved in every step of
all of this right at one point James
became too forceful he was grinding
against her shoes pressed against a
closet door and Becky asked him to be
more gentle he agreed and toned down the
grinding Becky had missed that she
kissed James his neck but didn't think
she gave him a hickey she did however
ask him whether he was into certain
types of sexual activity and she says
that she was aroused by all of this so
she says all of this to the title nine
court it cost him twelve thousand
dollars anyway so should men be worried
about this sort of thing why not why
wouldn't they be wouldn't you be worried
about the sort of stuff but according to
feminists because women have a
completely separate set of fears some of
which are justified and some of which
are overstated men should not be worried
about anything so Brett Kavanaugh is
guilty because bad things happen to
women is basically the logic of the left
and then they wonder why folks on the
center and on the right are not
interested in this particular point of
view well here is this this song from
Mercedes lens expressing this bizarre
point of view that bad that women are
threatened bad things happen to them
therefore men should shut up here she is
singing about it this has having five
million views on Twitter it's gone viral
of course
I can't wear a miniskirt apposite for a
second so she can do all those things
all the things she just said she can't
do she can do right the question is
whether they are wise things to do in
particular areas at night so when I am
walking in an area that I feel is unsafe
I don't walk alone in an area I feels
unsafe with my phone to my head in fact
the police tell you you're probably not
supposed to do that if you don't want to
become a target of crime generally that
you probably shouldn't do that are women
more vulnerable than men of course they
are of course they are but if this means
that Brett Kavanaugh is guilty I'm sort
of missing that also I don't know where
she lives but why can't she sleep with
the window open like I I really don't
know where she lives like maybe she
lives in a heavily crime-ridden area in
which case you might want to get out of
there but the number of break-in entries
where people just kind of like enter
your home randomly because you can't
sleep with the window open it doesn't
happen all that often I don't know about
chaperoning at bars is this a thing like
I haven't heard it frankly of a
chaperone for anything since like the
1920s with dating this idea that you
have has she been to a bar like there
are lots of women there with without
chaperones lots of men there too without
chaperones in fact bars are not famous
for their chaperoning it's not it's not
a square dance you know in the Hills
like what what what okay and then when
she says and then when she continues by
saying that she can't wear a miniskirt
even if it's the only one she owns she
literally can do that she literally can
do that in fact she can wear a miniskirt
even if it's not the only one that she
owns women wear miniskirts a lot in our
society
I mean honestly like this this is just
it's not accurate and if she feels fear
about this sort of stuff then I'm not
going to say that her fears are
completely unjustified on every score
but again I don't know why that is a
justification for saying that all women
have to be believed about every
allegation without corroborating
evidence I agree that men can be pigs
and that women are a greater risk of
being targeted by men than men are
but what does that have to do with the
price of tea in China it really has
nothing to do with the main topic at
issue but according to who left
something bad happened to me or it could
happen to me therefore you should shut
up about the possibility of something
bad happening to you which is just a
line of logic I do not understand in the
slightest okay meanwhile in other news
Brett Kavanaugh is still being run to
the ground by
on the left who refused to acknowledge
that he is in fact a legitimately
appointed Supreme Court Justice of the
United States the Democratic Party is
now selling t-shirts that say on them
supreme injustice which I mean listen we
sell t-shirts here at the Daily wire
like we have a set of t-shirts they say
things like facts don't care about your
feelings which feels like something
you'd want to advertise and feels like a
relatively eternal message I'm not sure
why you would buy a shirt that says
supreme injustice and then just be
wearing it around like in two years is
anyone gonna know what in the world that
t-shirt means the answer of course is no
but this is the take of the Democrats
they cannot let this go and if we don't
let this go we will win yeah that's how
what the polls are showing folks
Jennifer Weiner write to the New York
Times this this sort of come drives me
up a wall how do I explain justice
Kavanagh to my daughters well here's
what you say just as Cavanaugh was
accused of sexual assault back when he
was 17 years old there was no
corroborating evidence to support the
allegation and we don't ruin anybody's
life in this country based on just
allegations without any corroborating
evidence boom did it in two sentences
Wow amazing just amazing right I mean
that was just an incredible display of
intellectual dexterity just unreal
hey just amazing amazing but here's what
she actually writes before Hansard
politics President Trump was a fan of
different sort of spectacle
professional wrestling in pro wrestling
with its long-running soap opera like
story lines about heroes and villains
faces and heels you don't win you
flatten your opponents you climb onto
the turnbuckle hop onto the ropes hurl
yourself onto the body of your defeated
foe and are declared the winner
that was what Monday night's primetime
swearing-in ceremony of Brett Kavanaugh
- the Supreme Court felt like well
except for the fact that he will
actually sit on the Supreme Court and
then decide cases it's just like WWE and
then here's what she says with his wife
and young daughters in the audience
justice Cavanaugh made all the correct
conciliatory noises going on was the
red-faced furious man of late September
but his claims about dark money and
Clinton funded platz bond was the man
who alternatively wept and roared and
looked as if he was trying to pass a
kidney stone of compressed rage you
accused him of gang rape you accused him
of gang rape and if he had been robotic
you would have accused him of being
robotic how do I know cuz you did two
days before when he was on martha
maccallum show and then
and then here's what it says says the
gloating Crested over the weekend on
Saturday once justice Cavanaugh is a
sure thing
Senator John Cornyn tweeted out his
beers for brett hashtag along with a
picture of a glass of champagne the
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
thanked the clowns who protested justice
Cavanaugh's ascension and helped unify
his party many but he says but this
woman says for the record the clowns the
angry mob the violent protesters were
the women who confronted elected
officials in office halls and in
elevators many are survivors of sexual
violence the same kind that Christine
Blasi for testified she endured they
were trying to get the men in power to
hear them and act accordingly
but as I said that has nothing to do
with anything I may believe your story
of sexual assault that does not mean
that I have to believe every story of
sexual assault but here's the be meat of
the piece what am I supposed to tell my
daughters about all of this of course I
already know I've been talking them
about it for years
be aware of your surroundings okay make
sure someone knows where you are and
when to expect you back don't drink too
much don't put your drink down don't
walk or run or bike the same route don't
stay out too late don't walk alone in
the dark if a guy asks you out and
you're not interested don't hurt his
feelings and don't laugh at him because
a humiliated man is an angry man and
sometimes angry men hurt women and so
some of that I think is good advice just
for anyone like walking alone in the
dark in a crime-ridden area is dumb not
drinking too much make sense right don't
drink too much that's stupid
I've never heard this thing that if a
guy asks you out that you have to not
hurt his feelings like that that's a new
one I haven't heard that one because
frankly I can't think of a dude that I
know who hasn't asked a woman out and
had his feelings hurt I can't think of a
single dude that this is that this is
not happen to and 99% of dudes don't go
on to rape people and that's that's not
actually a thing but here's what she
says she says our girls will learn to
police their clothes their words their
drinking their behavior their choices
because they've been watching what
they've seen is this if you get hurt
it's probably your fault not a single
person says that and if you tell
probably no one will believe you not a
single person says that and even if
people do probably nothing will happen
not a single person says that either the
conflation of I'm upset about justice
Cavanaugh with America is systemically
unjust against women is just it's absurd
and it's a lie and I'm speaking as a guy
with my own daughter and with three
younger sisters it's it's
silliness but again the motivating
factor for a lot of left right now is
rage and they don't understand that that
rage there's gonna be a delayed effect
but the rage will blow back on them
anger is a short-term high and it's a
long-term low my friend Andrew kleavon's
is a danger anger is the devil's cocaine
that's probably about right you gotta
get a very high high and then you die of
an OD and that's basically what we were
what we are risk of right now okay time
for a couple of things that I like and
then we'll do a couple of things that I
hate so things that I like in this video
for kind of Justin Norman is just
hysterical so he decided that he was
going to create a new service it's
called Nazi maker.com
it's a service so that folks on the Left
can make anyone into a Nazi here is the
here's the video he cuts to push his new
product Nazi maker calm are you looking
to resist fascism but can't find a
single Nazi to punch we've all been
there fortunately due to recent
breakthrough advances in Nazi hunting
technology there's a solution
sounds like capitalism okay we all have
to make sacrifices to save America now
put down that rock and point your
MacBook Pro web browser
wwsz maker com now just type in the name
of any conservative centrist or even
liberal and with just a few keystrokes
you can easily transform any person with
whom you disagree and to a freshly
minted white supremacist just look at
how easy it is oh my god you are now and
now that you've turned all of these
public figures into Nazis you can assume
everyone who follows them is a Nazi too
and since every Nazi deserves a good
punch in the throat I think we all know
what these disgusting fascists are in
for at their next speaking event thanks
nazi maker.com
hey no problem guy yep that is a pretty
good take on exactly how the left has
decided to polarize the political debate
at this point now for an actual thing
that I like someone that might be able
to bring us together at least a little
bit Netflix has is yeah I've only seen
the trailer because Evan actually
brought out the series yet it just looks
spectacular it's a new series called
Medal of Honor in which they talk about
the stories of folks who have won the
Medal of Honor and it just looks awesome
here's a little bit of the trailer one
thing that you're gonna learn in combat
you learn a lot about love when you're
willing to put yourself in front of that
bullet for your men that's love the
Medal of Honor is the ultimate form of
recognition for courage on the
battlefield
anybody who receives it is immediately
hailed as a hero like none other
it has to be witnessed and people have
to write reports about why this person
deserves it they have earned it and they
have earned it the hard way the Medal of
Honor represents usually the worst day
of your lives it is important that
people hear these stories it's a legacy
and it deserves to be told or the next
generations to come he carried me about
10 miles cause my friendship I know that
he would try to take instrument right I
mean this this really looks good and I
can't wait to see it looks like Scott
reenactment and and documentary stories
it just looks it looks terrific terrific
so I'm looking forward to it and I think
you might like it as well which is why I
bring it up okay time for a couple of
things that I hate so thing I hate
number one so Hillary Clinton everything
that she says is just terrible these
days well my favorite part of this
interview she did on CNN is where she
was asked about the allegations against
Bill Clinton based on her speeches and
her statements about Brett Kavanaugh and
here's what she had to say about Bill
Clinton Brett Kavanaugh there's a very
significant difference and that is the
intense long-lasting partisan
investigation that was conducted in the
90s if you know the Republicans starting
with President Trump on down want a
comparison they should welcome such an
investigation themselves okay so I love
this I love that she says they should
welcome an investigation themselves she
literally called it a vast right-wing
conspiracy when people suggested that
her husband was lying about his sexual
activity in the White House but she says
the Republicans should welcome the
investigation also I love that she says
that there is a difference between Bill
Clinton and Brett Kavanaugh right there
was evidence against Bill Clinton he
admitted a lot of the stuff that people
alleged him doing there was corroborate
of evidence for Juanita Broderick she
talked to people at the time there was
physical evidence that she'd been abused
so yes it turns out that there is a
difference between Brett Kavanaugh and
Bill Clinton Bill Clinton was guilty of
stuff and we
no evidence that Brett Kavanaugh
actually was outside of the allegations
themselves other things that I hate so
the media have done just an awful job
this week like many weeks and Don Lemon
led the pack as soon as we were done
with the Brett Kavanaugh hearings he
went back to the news that's at the top
of everybody's mind and that news is of
course that storm and Daniel's had sex
with President Trump 12 years ago that
is at the top of every design so stormy
Daniels has a new book out no one cares
about the book except for her
description of mushrooms apparently but
here was Don Lemon interviewing stormy
Daniels about president Trump's genitals
again and the reason this is not
relevant well because no one accused
President Trump of actual sexual abuse
in this case this was literally
consensual affair that he had with a
woman 12 years ago but we're still
talking about it I'm getting rather
irritated with all this as amusing as I
find all the Mario Kart references you
said you don't have many regrets but the
one that you have recently is writing
about the president's private parts why
do you regret that um I don't really
regret it I just have a couple of
moments where I'm like oh that was kind
of mean but then I look back and all the
horrible things he said to about other
people and women and calling women pegs
and like you know attacking girls
weights and their looks and then I don't
feel so bad
why is she still a thing why are we
still talking about stormy Daniels at
this point I mean barring some new
information about the payoff to stormy
Daniels violating election law I'm not
sure why she's being interviewed we know
her story and her story is pretty non
shocking well it did anyone really think
that President Trump who has a long
history of stooping everything on two
legs that that guy did not stop storming
Daniels or that there weren't going to
be descriptions of his genitals out
there but the media is fascinated by
this because of course the members of
the media really really really hate
President Trump
okay well we will be back here tomorrow
