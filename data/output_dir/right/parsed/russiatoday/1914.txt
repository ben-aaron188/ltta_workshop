world in Russia I have an idea but will
we in Baku
it's too honest below you see to be as

Samara vamos a ver si nos Antony mundo
tamuka vamos a lunar soon encoded and
it's a CMOS omission evident this even
previous previous MOCA period he
previous mother tomorrow
my first impression of Samara was its
sheer scale when I arrived at the train
station I was struck by its massive size
I've never seen such a colossal train
station before it's 100 meters high like
a 30 story skyscraper as I learned later
Samara does things on a grand scale
you know we tell you tomorrow I must
meet this cosmonaut you know he is in
the morning with the idea is to meet in
the morning in the gospel of Museum I
don't know exactly what it is but do you
know the question is you know where is
it and how to go there tomorrow in the
at 8:00 7:30 on nurses do it's after I'm
asking you if you know where is the you

throat and steam up shut some onion

minutes to walk from the station to our
hotel but it was enough time to
understand that we might get lost lost

Samarra is one of the biggest cities in
Russia there are many different kinds of
hotel here according to official data as
of 2017 there were 160 hotels of various
standards by the summer of 2018 Samara
will have five more five-star hotels
built specially for football fans and
three of them are near the city's main
stadium Samara arena the city lies on
the Volga River and you can rent a room
in one of the numerous boats anchored
there we arrived late in the evening and
were starving in Samara it's not a
problem to find a cafe or restaurant
open after 11:00 p.m. at the hotel they
recommended a cosy sports bar it's
decorated in the colours of the local
football club clearly a serviette of the
local patrons are supporters of the team
and they'd love to come here to watch
games on a giant screen so simple and
also the worst thing was like us at the
table next to us some lads were having a
great time it turned out they were queer
fans and they were very sociable guys
they approached us after they heard my
attempts to communicate with Vitaly I'd
always thought the Russian fans were
rather wild but lyosha Sonya and Nikita
were very amiable when they found out
why we'd come they offered to show us
the football side of Samara and happily
one of them spoke English could it be
that my linguistic torture was over I
don't know how long we stayed there but
we returned to the hotel late
Vitaliy and I started the next day in a
rocket or rather underneath it the
rocket is the locals nickname for the
Samaras Space Museum the building itself
is a pedestal with a real Soyuz carrier
rocket mounted on top it's 70 meters
high including the rocket another
example of Samaras grand scale I've
never seen such a tall museum in Soviet
times Samara with a closed City because
many secret space industry factories
were located here the World Cup
organizers decided to use Samaras space
heritage as a trademark the city's World
Cup ambassadors are not just athletes
there's a cosmonaut among them to a lake

times and his route in space

museum full of American children will
tell you about it sighs Oh sir our new
football friends were waiting for us
when we were done with the interview
Vitali and I were whisked off to a
unique museum devoted to Samaras
football heritage the museum the pride
of the local supporters is in the city
center near kubasov square the easiest
way to get there is by tram
cowfish on our way Nikita and jr. vied
with each other to tell us about their
city for example in Soviet time Samara
was called qu Bishop the name of the
famous Russian politician the original
pre-revolutionary name was restored up
to the USSR's collapse but the main
square is still named after the local
Bolshevik quit Bishop Square is another
example of Samaras gigantism covering 17
and a half hectares
it's Russia's largest square for the
summer 2018 World Cup a fan festival
will take place here just a stone's
throw from the football museum kuba
shove square is currently getting a
facelift especially for the occasion
and where's the museum exactly it's here
in the in this Coronel museum behind
this yellow building behind yes
Samara really is a football town and the
best proof of this is the football
museum it's tucked away in a small
basement on Khruschev square it's a
public museum so entrance and tours are
free along with a multitude of balls
shirts and gloves
it also has art installations paintings
photos fan scarves and all kinds of
football memorabilia Samara fans put it
all together themselves of course the
largest part of the exhibition is
dedicated to the pride of Samara its
crew Lea however you can also find items
representing international football here
a summer school in a shitty she she she
she explained that she has a nice truck
engine screams football just a cool tool

in Ashman with you for a moment I

in addition to the displays even the
walls floors and ceilings have a
football theme each room has its own
individual design and concept this one
has a football dressing room theme while
this is a local fan zone but the soul of
the museum is revealed in the last hall
yeah yeah
watch when us bullets spinner Buddha's

beer is probably the drink most
associated with football and Samara is
the birthplace of Russia's favorite beer
after the museum our new friends invited
us no not for a drink but to go on
another tour this brewery was opened
more than 100 years ago and today it's a
state-of-the-art facility apart from
tours it also hosts beer tastings
however to get really acquainted with
the product you should leave the brewery
and go to a legendary place where they
sell the beer on draft it's right next
to the brewery why do they call it the
bottom no one knows for sure but in
Russian there's an expression to sink to
the bottom of life which means to become
an alcoholic another interpretation is
at the bottom is Samaras lowest point
admittedly at first sight it doesn't
look too salubrious the beer is
delivered straight from the brewery
through a pipeline and the prices are
amazing just 100 roubles for 1.5 liters
you can also buy all kinds of sun-dried
smoked and fried fish here a perfect
snack
and our beers great too and I know a
thing or two about it it goes down so
easy that you can get a bit carried away
I warn you be careful not to hit the
bottom in the literal sense
oh he dumped it fun
hey welcome and what do you think nuke
do what they have look what they have
good women in the hotels you know Julie
yes this know nice nice nice I think
Samara
I miss you much not yet
tomorrow I was angry and scared because
because of the translation you know yeah
are you to to Bartowski on how are you -
to pass passkey
despite hitting the bottom last night
the morning of our third and last day in
Samara was a cheery affair
it means the beer was really good

interview with the deputy governor of
samara region while we were climbing the
stairs of the stadium Anna told me the
arena's working title had been spheroid
a rather weird geometrical name however
one look at the city's main arena is
enough to understand why it stands a

at its highest point the arena stands
are divided into two tiers and its
seating will benefit from an infrared
heating system in winter the natural
grass pinch will also be heated but that
won't be necessary for the World Cup as
Samara enjoys glorious summers what's
more in another example of how Samara
does things on a grand scale the stadium
has set a record for the number of VIP
seats available 1200 in all Samara arena
will have six World Cup games including
one last 16 game and a quarterfinal
