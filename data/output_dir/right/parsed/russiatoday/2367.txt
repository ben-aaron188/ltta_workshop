hate convoys to all areas in need and
immediate emergency medical evacuations
the UN convoys
and evacuation teams are ready to go mr.
president this draft resolution also
calls for the immediate lifting of
sieges or populated areas including
Eastern Goethe it reiterates its demand
reminding in particular the Syrian
authorities that all parties have an
obligation to act in accordance with
international law to protect civilians
and hospitals and other medical
facilities
this draft makes an exception for
military operations directed against
ISIL al-qaeda and al-nusra front and
other terrorist groups as designated by
the Security Council this does in no way
relieve the parties to the conflict in
Syria from upholding their obligations
under international law at all times
including the principle of distinction
proportionality and precaution
mr. president this draft resolution is
not a comprehensive peace deal on Syria
its aim is purely humanitarian there are
already ceasefire agreements in force
for the areas where fighting as asked
escalated the most they need to be
complied with there are existing
monitoring mechanisms that can be
utilized the role of this council is to
push the parties to the conflict to
comply with a proposed cessation of
hostilities in order to urgently enable
need alleviation of suffering for the
people of Syria if this resolution is
adopted today it can deescalate violence
save lives alleviate suffering and break
the deadlock on humanitarian access and
sieges since the first call for
cessation of hostilities the situation
has gotten dramatically worse
particularly in eastern gutte as we have
heard from the Secretary General and
from under secretary-general mark lo Kok
seven years of war and the situation for
innocent civilians in Syria has never
been worse but we have an opportunity to
turn things around today to avert the
disaster unfolding before our eyes the
resolution before you represents a
resolute and very urgent attempt for
this council to take decisive and mean
full action today we count on each and
every one of you to do the right thing
thank you very much mr. president

Thank You mr. president and I want to
thank the pen holders both Sweden and
Kuwait for their work and their
sacrifice and their time in the
negotiations and as we go through
negotiations I think it's also important
that we bring this council some of the
voices of the Syrian people in eastern
Goethe who have suffered so much while
waiting for this Security Council to act
a doctor treating patients in a
makeshift hospital described the
condition she is facing quote we're
mental and emotional wrecks there's
nothing more we can do we are bled dry
in a haunting video the doctor walks
into a room with a crying mother as she
says quote I'm waiting for my son to die
at least he'll be free of pain I was
just making bread for him when the roof
fell in
he's going straight to heaven at least
in heaven there's food another message
we received yesterday that I think was
said to you in all of the close
consultations but I think it's important
to say it again was one that was an
emergency call from a doctor in eastern
Goethe quote we have a horrible
situation here we're being targeted with
all kinds of weapons non-stop we lack
everything water food medical supplies
shelter this is a disaster everyone is
just waiting to die today the Security
Council finally took a step toward
addressing these devastating levels of
human suffering in Syria the United
States wants nothing more than to see
the ceasefire in this resolution
implemented immediately across the
country it is critical that the Assad
regime and its allies comply with our
demand to stop the assault on Eastern
Goethe and immediately allow food and
medicine to reach everyone who needs it
all of us on this council must do our
part to press the Assad regime as hard
as we can to comply but we are late to
respond to this crisis very late on
Wednesday the secretary-general
made an emotional plea for an immediate
ceasefire in Syria to allow the very
basic necessities to get to the people
Kuwait and Sweden had a version of this
resolution ready to go for a vote but
Russia called for a delay on Thursday in
an effort to stall Russia called for an
open meeting on the humanitarian
situation in Syria at that meeting 14
members of this council were ready to
impose a ceasefire but Russia obstructed
the vote again and then yesterday this
council sat around for hours ready to
vote only to have Russia delay it again
every minute the council waited on
Russia the human suffering group getting
to a vote became a moral responsibility
for everyone but not for Russia not for
Syria not for Iran I have to ask why at
least 19 health facilities had been
bombed since Sunday 19 as they dragged
out the negotiation the bombs from
Assad's fighter jets continued to fall
in the three days it took us to adopt
this resolution how many mothers lost
their kids to the bombing and the
shelling how many more images did we
need to see of fathers holding their
dead children all for nothing because
here we are voting for a ceasefire that
could have saved lives days ago and
after all of this time hardly anything
has changed in the resolution except a
few words and some commas the Syrian
people should not have to die waiting
for Russia to organize their
instructions from Moscow or to discuss
it with the Syrians and why did the
council allow this there is no good
reason we shouldn't have done this
Wednesday or Thursday or Friday we may
not know the faces that we're talking
about we may not know their names or
these people but they know us and we all
failed them this week
I guess there is unity in that today
Russia has belatedly decided to join the
international consensus and accept the
need to call for a ceasefire but only
after trying every possible way to avoid
it
this resolution marks a moment of
council unity that we must cease and
maintain beyond the 30-day time frame we
hope this resolution will be a turning
point where Russia will join us in
pushing for the political settlement to
this conflict and take action to
re-establish real accountability for the
use of chemical weapons in Syria
progress starts by adhering to the
ceasefire with no excuses after so many
years of defying this councils demands
the Assad regime must change course none
of us should be so naive as to accept
that the Assad regime can continue
indiscriminately bombing schools
hospitals and homes under the fake
excuse of counter terrorism Assad's
bombing must stop the ceasefire must be
given a chance to work we look to the
Assad regime's backers especially Russia
and Iran to address what the
secretary-general rightly called a quote
hell on earth all eyes will now be on
the Syrian regime Iran and Russia our
goal with this resolution is clear the
Assad regime needs to stop its military
activities around Eastern goota and for
once allow humanitarian access to all of
those who need it we are deeply
skeptical that the regime will comply
but we supported this resolution because
we must demand nothing less we owe this
to the innocent people of Syria begging
for help in the days to come are
resolved to stand by our demands and
this resolution will be tested all of us
must rise to the challenge of
maintaining the ceasefire just as we
came together today all of us must do
everything we can to make the demands of
this resolution a reality it's the only
way
restore the credibility of this council
the Syrian people had been waiting long
enough

president
the United Kingdom welcomes the adoption
of resolution 2401 and in particular we
applaud your work together with Sweden
as pen holders but this is not a moment
for self congratulation it's taken us
far too long to agree this resolution
while we have been arguing over commas
Assad's planes have been killing more
civilians in their homes and in their
hospitals imposing unbearable suffering
and despite the amount of time we have
spent in this chamber over many years
discussing the devastating humanitarian
crisis we have still not been able to
achieve the peace and security that the
Syrian people so desperately need as the
conflict enters its eighth year the
situation in eastern guter and elsewhere
in the country is far worse than we ever
thought imaginable the barbarity and
depravity of the Assad regime shows no
limits
we must never lose sight of the fact
that the pictures we see and the stories
we hear from this comfortable chamber
are the agonizing reality for hundreds
of thousands of civilians for men women
and children who are being forced to eke
out an existence underground to avoid
being killed by a regime that commits
daily atrocities against its own people
I've heard some say that the information
about the situation in eastern guter is
propaganda adopter in eastern goethe
having heard these comments said this
morning and i quote
amid the chaos and the bombs it is the
not being believed that almost hurts the
most we are dying here every day and
when people say they do not believe us
that is pain upon pain end of quote
this isn't propaganda it's a living hell
for hundreds of thousands of residents
of Eastern guter as we have repeated
many times this intentional and
systematic targeting of civilians and
civilian objects not only violates
international humanitarian law it's a
war crime and the UK will be unrelenting
in our campaign to ensure accountability
by voting in favor of this resolution
today we are standing up and saying that
we will not stand by and let this happen
in the face of escalating violence
devastation and suffering we must all
now take practical steps to improve the
situation for those living and dying in
a hell of one man's making this
resolution demonstrates our resolve to
put a stop to the brutal violence it
demands all parties cease hostilities
without delay that means right now
immediately mr. president the role and
responsibility of this council does not
end with the passage of this resolution
quite the opposite
all UN member states but particularly
council members must now take
responsibility for ensuring that this
resolution is implemented in full
without delay the resolution calls for
the council to review implementation
within 15 days but we must all be active
in supporting and monitoring
implementation from the moment we step
out of this room if we see any of the
parties violating the terms of this
resolution we must bring it back to the
council immediately
those with any influence over the Syrian
regime Russia Iran have a particular
responsibility to ensure that this
ceasefire is respected in full and
without delay that all sieges are ended
and that humanitarian aid is delivered
this is the absolute minimum the people
of Syria deserve as much as we welcome
the passing of this resolution today it
is only a small step just as one a
convoy in three months to a besieged
area cannot even begin to address the
humanitarian crisis one resolution alone
cannot solve the situation in Syria we
must do everything in our collective
power to ensure that this resolution is
effective in delivering for those whom
we have failed to date and we must all
send a clear message to the Assad regime
abandon your attempt to pursue a
military strategy stop fighting and
engage seriously in un-led political
talks in Geneva mr. president in
conclusion let me reiterate the words of
my foreign secretary the entire world is
looking at the Assad regime Russia and
Iran you hold the keys not only to the
end of this obscene conflict but to the
safety humanitarian aid and basic
medical treatment that is being denied
to millions of people right now in Syria
for the mother giving birth
underground in eastern guter for the
child unable to learn as schools are
closed for yet another day for the
doctor battling airstrikes to treat
patients in in Lib all of us sitting
here today oh it to the people of Syria
to work together with renewed and
unyielding energy to achieve a political
solution that will bring peace to the
Syrian people thank you

colleagues the delegation of Carlson has
voted in favor of the draft resolution
on the cessation of hostilities in Syria
I expressed my gratitude to our two
penholders Sweden and Kuwait for their
determined efforts to find common ground
among the Security Council members
I thank also the members of the Security
Council for their constructive approach
for this resolution which has many
significant provisions the position of
Kurdistan is very consistent the
stability in the Middle East can be
achieved by reducing violence for
peaceful means and avoiding the
emergence of new tensions in the past
few days heads of states and governments
around the world have called on the
Syrian government to observe human
rights and both sides to exercise
restraint
simultaneously external incitement that
fuels tension should stop immediately so
that it does not endanger
regional security today we see that
Security Council is United in demanding
from all parties to cease hostilities
without delay now we expect from all the
countries that exercise influence on the
situation on the ground and conduct
military camp
against international terrorist groups
in Syria to interact and find common
ground for join fight against terrorism
taking practical steps to implement this
resolution Palestine calls on all forces
that support a knowledge settlement of
the Syrian conflict including the
government of Syria and the armed
opposition to fully comply with the
ceasefire regime and this resolution all
the parties must ensure safe and
unhindered access for the humanitarian
assistance to reach the affected areas
as well as the evacuated evacuation of
people in need of medical assistance my
foreign minister hopes that his
colleagues foreign ministers of the
gander states of the Istana process will
take additional constructive steps to
strictly implement the ceasefire
agreements and this coalition zones in
Syria at the meeting scheduled to take
place in the capital of Kazakhstan in
mid-march or early if needs be this year
it was a difficult but successful
deliberations we should all work
collectively to find a peaceful solution
and today's unity of Security Council
should continue since we have yet a lot
to accomplish in Syria and elsewhere I
think thank you very much mr. president
mr. president on Wednesday during the
high-level debate on the UN Charter I
quoted one of the founding fathers of
the united nations secretary city Gnaeus
he said that the members of the Security
Council have the obligation to agree so
that the council may be able to act and
act effectively today we finally managed
to agree to end the atrocious violence
in eastern Goethe to end attacks against
hospitals to end the killing of innocent
civilians including women and children
mr. president the kingdom of the Nan's
welcomes the unanimous adoption of this
crucial resolution
let me thank in particular the pen
holders cue light and Sweden for your
tireless efforts and skilled diplomatic
work we paid tribute to you today we
have a resolution now we need to see
action on the ground all UN member
states have an obligation to make sure
that the words of this resolution are
implemented without delay in
particularly the Syrian authorities have
a specific responsibility towards its
own people the resolution means the
following all parties must cease
hostilities without delay all parties
must engaged immediately for sustainable
and durable humanitarian poles of at
least 30 consecutive days throughout
Syria to enable the safe unimpeded and
sustained delivery of humanitarian aid
and services to enable medical
evacuations of the critically sick and
wounded in accordance with applicable
international law if implemented this
resolution means the cessation of
hostilities delivery of humanitarian aid
and urgent medical evacuations it is a
first step in the right direction but
much more is needed a political solution

president this council should remain
seized of the matter and closely monitor

the president
we welcome the unanimous adoption of
this resolution when the humanitarian
situation in Syria we voted in favor
because we believe the resolution could
make positive difference in the ground
in alleviating the continued tragedy of
Syrians having discussed the severe
humanitarian crisis in Syria almost
weekly it was clear that what was
required from this council was concrete
and collective action that could
contribute to alleviating the
intolerable suffering of Syrians in
wrong areas of the country we are
pleased that the council has acted and
sent the right message that could bring
cessation of hostilities that could
allow the UN and humanitarian partners
to have safe sustained and an impeded
humanitarian access to deliver the
much-needed humanitarian assistance to
all Syrians in need I wish to express
our sincere appreciation to the
delegation so Kuwait and Sweden that
have effectively and efficiently made
the process of negotiations we all know
it was not an easy task
but they did an excellent work in
accommodating the concerns of all
delegations was a high sense
of his possibility and patience we also
thank all delegations for their
flexibility during the negotiation
process we hope the positive spirit that
made the council to adopt this
resolution will create not only in
ensuring its effective implementation
but it would also lay the basis for
greater mutual understanding among all
those who have enormous influence over
development in Syria whether in the
humanitarian or political and security
domain we know given the realities this
is a tall order one matter would need to
be stressed on this occasion the
security situation in Syria is perhaps
more complicated today than it has ever
been over the last few years we should
not overlook the fact that the sources
of the humanitarian tragedy we see today
is a result for the difficult political
and security situation in the country we
trust that all those including those
that ambassador de lattre referred to
will continue to play a role which would
contribute to creating the basis for
progress in the peace process which is
so critical for ensuring that the
humanitarian tragedy in Syria is brought
to an end we only hope that what the
council has achieved today would lay the
basis for everything and even greater
humanitarian tragedy in Syria I thank
