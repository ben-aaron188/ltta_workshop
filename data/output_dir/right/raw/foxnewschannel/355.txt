1
00:00:01,371 --> 00:00:02,804
SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT MID-TERM

2
00:00:02,805 --> 00:00:04,606
ELECTION IN OUR LIFETIME.

3
00:00:04,607 --> 00:00:07,175
JOINING US NOW, A MAN WHO

4
00:00:07,176 --> 00:00:09,011
DESERVED A LOT OF CREDIT FOR

5
00:00:09,012 --> 00:00:10,012
THIS MOMENT, SENATOR LINDSAY

6
00:00:10,013 --> 00:00:11,980
GRAHAM OF SOUTH CAROLINA.

7
00:00:11,981 --> 00:00:14,516
SENATOR, I’M HAPPY --

8
00:00:14,517 --> 00:00:15,451
>> THANK YOU.

9
00:00:15,452 --> 00:00:16,585
>> Sean: I’M HAPPY ABOUT THE

10
00:00:16,586 --> 00:00:17,853
SUCCESS THE COUNTRY HAS HAD.

11
00:00:17,854 --> 00:00:20,756
YOU TOLD ME WHEN I SAW YOU IN

12
00:00:20,757 --> 00:00:22,224
WASHINGTON, I SAID, WHAT’S SUSAN

13
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:22,958
COLLINS LIKE, I SKPT YOU THE

14
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:26,628
QUESTION.

15
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:28,230
YOU SAID SHE IS SOMEBODY THAT

16
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:30,633
WILL SWAY HER, AND SHE WILL

17
00:00:30,634 --> 00:00:31,967
WILL LOOK AT EVERY FACT, NOBODY

18
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:33,235
DECIDE, I THINK THAT WAS THE

19
00:00:33,236 --> 00:00:34,570
MOST POWERFUL SPEECH I’VE SEEN

20
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:35,871
ON THE SENATE FLOOR.

21
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:38,574
>> WELL, IT’S HISTORIC.

22
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:39,975
IT CHANGED THE TRAJECTORY OF

23
00:00:39,976 --> 00:00:41,710
WHERE WE’RE HEADED IN THE SENATE

24
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:43,212
IN TERMS OF CONFIRMING JUDGES.

25
00:00:43,213 --> 00:00:45,114
SHE ADOPTED THE RULE OF LAW,

26
00:00:45,115 --> 00:00:46,716
REJECTED THE RULE OF THE MOB.

27
00:00:46,717 --> 00:00:49,752
IF I HAD TO TELL?

28
00:00:49,753 --> 00:00:52,188
A GOOD REASON TO VOTE FOR JUDGE

29
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:53,222
KAVANAUGH, I WOULD ASK THEM TO

30
00:00:53,223 --> 00:00:54,824
LOOK AT SUSAN’S SPEECH.

31
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:57,760
IT WAS INCREDIBLE IN DETAIL.

32
00:00:57,761 --> 00:00:59,195
FORCEFULLY DELIVERED.

33
00:00:59,196 --> 00:00:59,929
SHE DIDN’T LOOK LIKE SHE WAS

34
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:00,863
PAINED.

35
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:02,832
SHE HATED WHAT HAPPENED TO THE

36
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,400
PROCESS BUT SHE WAS CONFIDENT

37
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,635
THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH WAS THE

38
00:01:05,636 --> 00:01:07,971
RIGHT GUY AT THE RIGHT TIME.

39
00:01:07,972 --> 00:01:10,173
I THINK SHE SAVED THE SENATE AND

40
00:01:10,174 --> 00:01:11,174
THE ABYSS.

41
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:12,508
THE JUDICIARY FROM SLIDING INTO

42
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:14,344
>> Sean: YOU KNOW, SENATOR, I

43
00:01:14,345 --> 00:01:16,446
ARGUE I DON’T THINK WE WOULD BE

44
00:01:16,447 --> 00:01:17,847
HERE WITHOUT YOUR COURAGE.

45
00:01:17,848 --> 00:01:18,815
BUT, NO, I’VE KNOWN YOU A LONG

46
00:01:18,816 --> 00:01:20,817
TIME.

47
00:01:20,818 --> 00:01:21,217
[CHUCKLING]

48
00:01:21,218 --> 00:01:22,786
WE’VE HAD OUR DISAGREEMENTS.

49
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:24,854
>> I’M SURE WE WILL AGAIN.

50
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:26,356
>> Sean: THANKS, SENATOR.

51
00:01:26,357 --> 00:01:28,258
I CAN’T WAIT FOR THE NEXT

52
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:28,591
BATTLE.

53
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:30,226
>> ME, TOO I’M GETTING TIRED OF

54
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:32,829
THE LOVEFEST CRAP.

55
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:33,196
[LAUGHING]

56
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:34,598
>> Sean: THERE’S A LOT MORE ON

57
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,933
THE BALLOT IN 32 DAYS.

58
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:37,601
AM I WRONG?

59
00:01:37,602 --> 00:01:41,371
I’M WORRIED ABOUT WHAT I’VE BEEN

60
00:01:41,372 --> 00:01:41,771
WITNESSING.

61
00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:43,673
>> THERE’S TWO CHOICES, THE

62
00:01:43,674 --> 00:01:44,574
SUSAN COLLINS WAY OR THE

63
00:01:44,575 --> 00:01:45,942
PROTESTER WAY.

64
00:01:45,943 --> 00:01:47,844
WHO DO YOU WANT TO RUN THE

65
00:01:47,845 --> 00:01:48,545
GOVERNMENT?

66
00:01:48,546 --> 00:01:49,913
CONSERVATIVES ALIGNED WITH

67
00:01:49,914 --> 00:01:52,316
SENATOR COLLINS, TRYING TO WORK

00:01:52,317 --> 00:01:54,451
TOWARD EMPOWERING PEOPLE, MAKING
SENATOR COLLINS, TRYING TO WORK

69
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:54,452
TOWARD EMPOWERING PEOPLE, MAKING

70
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:55,285
US SAFE, MORE MONEY IN YOUR

00:01:55,286 --> 00:01:56,520
POCKET.

72
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:57,754
OR DO YOU WANT TO TURN YOUR

73
00:01:57,755 --> 00:01:59,089
GOVERNMENT OVER TO PEOPLE WHO

74
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,524
JUST YELL AND SPIT ON YOU.

75
00:02:00,525 --> 00:02:02,926
TO ME, THIS IS A REALLY

76
00:02:02,927 --> 00:02:03,594
IMPORTANT TIME IN AMERICAN

77
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:05,262
HISTORY.

78
00:02:05,263 --> 00:02:07,264
IT’S NOW ALL ABOUT KAVANAUGH.

79
00:02:07,265 --> 00:02:07,965
BEFORE IT WAS ABOUT A LOT OF

80
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:09,066
THINGS.

81
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:10,401
NOW IT’S PRETTY SIMPLE.

82
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:12,136
IF YOU VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC

83
00:02:12,137 --> 00:02:13,370
PARTY YOU’RE TURNING YOUR

84
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:15,439
GOVERNMENT OVER TO PEOPLE WHO

85
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,107

THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN PLACE,

89
00:02:20,779 --> 00:02:22,813
THAT MEANS THERE WILL BE AN

90
00:02:22,814 --> 00:02:24,348
ALLIANCE BETWEEN SUSAN COLLINS

91
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:26,217
AND OTHERS TO KEEP US SAFE AND

92
00:02:26,218 --> 00:02:27,551
MAKE OUR LIVES BETTER.

93
00:02:27,552 --> 00:02:29,253
PRETTY SIMPLE CHOICE.

94
00:02:29,254 --> 00:02:31,656
>> Sean: YOU KNOW, SENATOR, I

95
00:02:31,657 --> 00:02:33,024
REALLY BELIEVE THIS, AFTER WHAT

96
00:02:33,025 --> 00:02:34,625
WE’VE WITNESSED NOW, AND THIS

97
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:35,927
HAS BEEN BUILDING.

98
00:02:35,928 --> 00:02:39,730
YOU GUYS, YOU HAVE TO CLEAR THE

99
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:40,565
HALLS, WHERE YOUR OFFICES ARE.

100
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:43,067
>> YES.

101
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:44,235
>> Sean: I HONESTLY FEAR

102
00:02:44,236 --> 00:02:45,303
SOMEBODY IS GOING TO GET HURT

103
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:45,603
HERE.

104
00:02:45,604 --> 00:02:46,637
>> ME TOO.

105
00:02:46,638 --> 00:02:48,239
I’VE NEVER, YOU KNOW, WE’VE

106
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,074
BEEN, YOU KNOW, THE ONE THING I

107
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:51,276
LIKE ABOUT SENATOR COLLINS, IF

108
00:02:51,277 --> 00:02:52,277
YOU THINK CAN YOU CHANGE HER

109
00:02:52,278 --> 00:02:53,478
MIND BY YELLING AT HER AND

110
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,412
SHOWING UP AT HER HOUSE YOU’RE

111
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:56,347
DEAD WRONG.

112
00:02:56,348 --> 00:02:57,749
AGAIN, I WANT TO COMPLIMENT HER,

113
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,317
FOR STOPPING WHAT I THOUGHT WAS
AGAIN, I WANT TO COMPLIMENT HER,

114
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:01,519
FOR STOPPING WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE CLOSEST THING TO McCARTHYISM

115
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:01,520
THE CLOSEST THING TO McCARTHYISM

116
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,356
IN MY LIFETIME, THAT A MAN IS

117
00:03:05,357 --> 00:03:07,158
GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT,

118
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,494
FACTS DON’T MATTER, SMEARING HIM

119
00:03:09,495 --> 00:03:10,061
EQUATES TO HIM BEING

120
00:03:10,062 --> 00:03:11,463
DISQUALIFIED.

121
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:12,130
SHE STOOD TALL.

122
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:13,298
THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO

123
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:15,233
A GOOD MAN IS FOR A STRONG WOMAN
THE BEST THING THAT HAPPENED TO

124
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:15,234
A GOOD MAN IS FOR A STRONG WOMAN

125
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:17,068
TO COME TO HIS AID.

126
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:18,837
THE AID OF AN INDEPENDENT

127
00:03:18,838 --> 00:03:19,871
THAT’S EXACTLY -- SUSAN CAME TO

128
00:03:19,872 --> 00:03:21,673
JUDICIARY TONIGHT.

129
00:03:21,674 --> 00:03:23,108
>> Sean: IS IT TRUE THAT SENATOR

130
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:24,476
DAINS IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO

131
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:25,911
MAKE IT TO WALK HIS DAUGHTER

132
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:27,446
DOWN THE AISLE, YOU WORKED THAT

133
00:03:27,447 --> 00:03:27,713
OUT?

134
00:03:27,714 --> 00:03:28,447
>> I THINK THEY HAVE WORKED IT

135
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:29,281
OUT.

136
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:30,682
I WANT HIM TO BE ABLE TO DO

137
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:32,584
BOTH.

138
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:33,585
BUT WE’RE HUMAN BEINGS IS THE

139
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:34,586
POINT.

140
00:03:34,587 --> 00:03:36,188
WE’RE NOT PERFECT.

141
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:37,022
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS A HUMAN

142
00:03:37,023 --> 00:03:38,257
BEING.

143
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:40,192
AND IT’S ALL GOING TO TURN OUT

144
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:42,027
WELL, GOD BLESS SUSAN COLLINS

145
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:43,729
AND JEFF FLAKE.

146
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,197
>> Sean: HONESTLY, THOSE THAT

147
00:03:45,198 --> 00:03:47,599
FOOD UP FOR DUE PROCESS, THOSE

148
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,335
THAT STOOD UP FOR THE

149
00:03:49,336 --> 00:03:50,836
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE, I

150
00:03:50,837 --> 00:03:51,637
THOUGHT WOULD BE SOMETHING WE

151
00:03:51,638 --> 00:00:00,000
ALL AGREE AND APPARENTLY THIS IS
