00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:19,134
CONCERNED.

14
00:00:19,135 --> 00:00:22,037
LITTLE BIT OF YOUR BACKGROUND.

GIVING THAT TO THE PUBLIC SO

36
00:01:05,781 --> 00:01:07,983
THEY THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

37
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:08,750
TALKING ABOUT.

38
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:11,386
YOU'RE A CONTRIBUTING AUTHOR

PANEL OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

42
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:24,132
WE'VE HEARD IT ALL.

43
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:25,834
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE?

44
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,335
>> WELL, SURFACE TEMPERATURE OF

45
00:01:27,336 --> 00:01:29,471
THE PLANET IS WARMER THAN IT

46
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:36,211
WAS 100 YEARS AGO ABOUT.

47
00:01:36,212 --> 00:01:39,381
9/10th OF A DEGREE CELSIUS.

48
00:01:39,382 --> 00:01:41,683
MARK: 9/10th DEGREE OF CELSIUS

49
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:43,351
IS THAT A LOT?

50
00:01:43,352 --> 00:01:43,785
>> NO.

51
00:01:43,786 --> 00:01:45,754
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY

52
00:01:45,755 --> 00:01:49,257
HUMAN BEINGS, WE HAVEN'T PUT

53
00:01:49,258 --> 00:01:51,326
ENOUGH CO2 IN THE AIR, AND ONE

54
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:52,994
IN THE LATER PART OF THE 20th

55
00:01:52,995 --> 00:01:56,564
CENTURY THAT SLOWS DOWN OR

56
00:01:56,565 --> 00:01:59,501
DEPENDS WHOSE DATA YOU USE ONLY

57
00:01:59,502 --> 00:02:04,606
TO RESUME WITH THE BIG EL NINO

58
00:02:04,607 --> 00:02:06,107
THAT COVERED THE NEWS THE LAST

59
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:07,142
COUPLE OF YEARS.

60
00:02:07,143 --> 00:02:10,245
THAT MEANS THAT PROBABLY HALF,

61
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:12,247
MAYBE HALF OF THAT NINE-TENTHS

62
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:15,216
OF THE DEGREE MIGHT BE CAUSED

63
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:16,284
BY GREENHOUSE GASES.

64
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:17,719
WHEN THE PLANET WARMED

65
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,188
BEGINNING 1976, THE TEMPERATURE

66
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:22,691
OF THE STRATOSPHERE STARTED TO

67
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:23,792
STOP, THAT'S THE PREDICTION OF

68
00:02:23,793 --> 00:02:27,228
GREENHOUSE THEORY THAT'S NOT

69
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:27,595
INTUITIVE.

70
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:28,730
THE GREAT PHILOSOPHER OF

71
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,565
SCIENCE CARL POPPER SAID IF YOU

72
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:31,666
CAN MEET A DIFFICULT PREDICTION

73
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:33,468
WITH YOUR THEORY, YOU CAN

74
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:34,569
CONTINUE TO ENTERTAIN YOUR

75
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:34,903
THEORY.

76
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,005
SO THE THEORY IS RIGHT, BUT THE

77
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:38,506
APPLICATION OF IT IS WRONG.

78
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:40,275
IT IS NOWHERE NEAR AS WARM AS

79
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:42,377
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

80
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:45,013
THE COMPUTER MODELS ARE MAKING

81
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:47,482
SYSTEMATIC, DRAMATIC ERRORS

82
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:50,819
OVER THE ENTIRE TROPICS WHICH

83
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,854
IS 40% OF THE EARTH, AND IT'S

84
00:02:52,855 --> 00:02:54,789
WHERE ALL OUR MOISTURE COMES

85
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,090
FROM.

86
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,157
ALMOST ALL OF IT.

87
00:02:56,158 --> 00:02:59,227
MARK: LET ME STOP YOU THERE.

88
00:02:59,228 --> 00:02:59,961
WHO DOES THESE COMPUTER MODELS?

89
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:00,695
>> GOVERNMENTS.

90
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:02,564
THERE ARE 32 FAMILIES OF

91
00:03:02,565 --> 00:03:05,433
COMPUTER MODELS THAT ARE USED

92
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:08,103
BY THE UNITED NATIONS.

93
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,206
EACH GOVERNMENT SPONSORED.

94
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:13,441
AND ALL OF THEM ARE PREDICTING

95
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:15,577
FAR, FAR TOO MUCH WARMING.

96
00:03:15,578 --> 00:03:17,011
THE DISPARITY BETWEEN WHAT'S

97
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:18,780
BEEN PREDICTED TO HAPPEN, WHICH

98
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,149
LOOKS LIKE SDMSHGS WHAT IS

99
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,951
HAPPENING CONTINUES TO GROW.

100
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,919
MARK: WE KNOW THAT FOR A FACT?

101
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,222
>> YEAH, YOU COULD JUST LOOK AT

102
00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:28,523
THE WEATHER BALLOON

103
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:28,990
TEMPERATURES.

104
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:30,792
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE SATELLITE

105
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:31,259
TEMPERATURES.

106
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,627
YOU CAN LOOK AT SOMETHING

107
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:34,696
CALLED THE REANALYSIS DATA.

108
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:35,864
THEY BEHAVE IN CONCERT.

109
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:37,432
THEY'RE SHOWING THE SAME THING,

110
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:38,733
AND THE SAME THING IS A LOT

111
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:39,968
DIFFERENT THAN THIS THING.

112
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:43,037
HOWEVER, WE NEED TO CALL THE

113
00:03:43,038 --> 00:03:43,505
SPECIAL COUNSEL.

114
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:44,239
MARK: SPECIAL COUNSEL?

115
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,074
>> YES, BECAUSE ONE MODEL

116
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:46,374
WORKS.

117
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,675
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?

118
00:03:47,676 --> 00:03:48,943
IT'S THE RUSSIAN MODEL.

119
00:03:48,944 --> 00:03:50,612
MARK: LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

120
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:51,780
SO ALL THE GOVERNMENT MODELS

121
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:53,114
ARE LIKE THIS?

122
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:53,615
>> YEAH.

123
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:55,350
MARK: THE RUSSIAN MODEL LIKE

124
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:55,683
THIS.

125
00:03:55,684 --> 00:03:56,351
>> YEAH.

126
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:58,520
THE RUSSIAN MODEL HAS THE LEAST

127
00:03:58,521 --> 00:03:59,220
WARMING IN IT.

128
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:00,889
MARK: THE RUSSIAN MODEL HAS THE

129
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,390
LEAST WARMING AND PRETTY MUCH

130
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:02,891
FOLLOWS REALITY.

131
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:05,393
WHAT'S BEEN TESTED OVER A FEW

132
00:04:05,394 --> 00:04:05,760
DECADES.

133
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:06,427
>> YEAH, CORRECT.

134
00:04:06,428 --> 00:04:08,396
IF WE WERE RATIONAL ABOUT THIS,

135
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:10,098
THINK ABOUT THE DAILY WEATHER

136
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:10,465
FORECAST.

137
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:12,467
YOU WATCH THE WEATHER CHANNEL,

138
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:13,768
THEY GO THIS MODEL SAYS THAT,

139
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:15,303
THAT MODEL SAYS THAT, WE THINK

140
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:18,239
THIS ONE IS WORKING THE BEST,

141
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,109
WE'RE GOING TO RELY ON THAT.

142
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,043
WELL, FOR CLIMATE FORECAST

143
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:23,578
SHOULD BE USING THE RUSSIAN

144
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:25,413
MODEL BUT WE'RE NOT.

145
00:04:25,414 --> 00:04:27,148
WE USE THIS BIG SPATE OF ALL

146
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:29,117
THE OTHER MODELS THAT HAVE THE

147
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:30,819
WARMING THAT'S NOT OCCURRING.

148
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,421
MARK: WHY ARE THE OTHER MODELS,

149
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:35,290
31 OF THEM, WRONG.

150
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,393
AND WHY DO THEY ALL GO THE SAME

151
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:39,027
DIRECTION, UP?

152
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,695
>> BECAUSE, THEY WHAT ARE IS

153
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:43,965
CALLED PARAMETERIZED.

154
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:46,267
THEY'RE ALL PARAMETERIZED, CAN

155
00:04:46,268 --> 00:04:49,204
I TRANSLATE PARAMETERIZED IN

156
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:49,704
ENGLISH?

157
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:50,171
FUDGE.

158
00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:52,106
THEY DON'T GET THE RIGHT

159
00:04:52,107 --> 00:04:53,508
ANSWER, DON'T KNOW THE RIGHT

160
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:55,510
ANSWER FOR CERTAIN PHENOMENA,

161
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:57,812
SO WE ESSENTIALLY PUT IN CODE

162
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:00,448
STEPS THAT GIVE US WHAT WE

163
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:01,683
THINK IT SHOULD BE.

164
00:05:01,684 --> 00:05:04,319
AND SYSTEMATIC ERROR THAT WAS

165
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,621
MADE WAS THE MODELS WERE TUNED,

166
00:05:06,622 --> 00:05:09,390
AS IT SAID.

167
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:09,691
TUNED.

168
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:11,226
TUNED TO SIMULATE THE WARMING

169
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,128
OF THE EARLY 20th CENTURY.

170
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:18,132
BEGAN IN 1910, ENDED IN 1945,

171
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:20,368
ABOUT .45 DEGREES CELSIUS.

172
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:23,037
MARK, THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN

173
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:24,105
CAUSED BY CARBON DIOXIDE.

174
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:25,673
MARK: BECAUSE THERE WASN'T

175
00:05:25,674 --> 00:05:26,007
ENOUGH.

176
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:28,509
>> WE HAD TO PUT ENOUGH IN THAT

177
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,410
THE BACKGROUND CARBON DIOXIDE

178
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:31,112
CONCENTRATION IS 280 MILLION

179
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:32,747
PARTS PER MILLION.

180
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:36,451
WHEN THE FIRST WARMING STARTED,

181
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:38,152
208 PARTS PER MILLION.

182
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:41,489
IF IT IS THAT SENSITIVE TO

183
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,391
18PPM CHANGE IN CO2 WE WOULDN'T

184
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:45,159
BE TALKING ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW

185
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,594
AND WE'D BE SWEATING BULLETS.

186
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:49,998
>> SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS MAN

187
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:51,666
MADE CARBON DIOXIDE THE LAST

188
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:53,568
CENTURY COULD NOT HAVE PRODUCED

189
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:53,801
--

190
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:55,703
>> EARLY 20th CENTURY.

191
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:57,038
MARK: COULD NOT HAVE PRODUCED

192
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:57,906
THIS HEAT.

193
00:05:57,907 --> 00:05:59,474
SO WHAT DID?

194
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:00,275
DO WE KNOW?

195
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:00,975
>> NO.

196
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:03,645
AND THREE MOST IMPORTANT WORDS

197
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:06,247
IN LIFE MAY NOT BE I LOVE YOU.

198
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:07,949
IT MAY BE I DON'T KNOW.

199
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,850
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY REALLY

200
00:06:08,851 --> 00:06:10,618
KNOWS WHAT KICKED OFF THAT

201
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:11,219
WARMING.

202
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,487
THERE'S LOTS OF THEORIES.

203
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:15,223
ONE IS THAT IT WAS THE FINAL

204
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:17,992
ESCAPE FROM A GOLD PERIOD,

205
00:06:17,993 --> 00:06:19,294
MULTICENTURY PERIOD KNOWN AS

206
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,862
THE LITTLE ICE AGE.

207
00:06:20,863 --> 00:06:22,063
THAT'S THE PLAUSIBILITY, WHY

208
00:06:22,064 --> 00:06:23,665
DID IT HAPPEN THEN.

209
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,334
BUT WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD

210
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:26,935
EXPLANATION FOR THAT.

211
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:29,804
BECAUSE WE FORCED THE COMPUTER

212
00:06:29,805 --> 00:06:32,573
MODELS TO SAY, HUMAN INFLUENCE,

213
00:06:32,574 --> 00:06:33,241
CO2 AND OTHER STUFF.

214
00:06:33,242 --> 00:06:36,277
WE MADE THE MODELS TOO

215
00:06:36,278 --> 00:06:37,378
SENSITIVE, AND SO THAT'S WHY

216
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:39,347
WHEN YOU GET TO THE LATE 20th

217
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:41,549
CENTURY, ALL OF A SUDDEN

218
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,151
THEY'RE WARMING UP LIKE CRAZY

219
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,620
AND THE REALITY IS DOWN HERE.

220
00:06:45,621 --> 00:06:48,589
IT WAS GUARANTEED TO HAPPEN.

221
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,758
THIS WAS REVEALED IN SCIENCE

222
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,893
MAGAZINE IN LATE 2016, AND

223
00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:53,795
THERE WAS A PAPER PUBLISHED BY

224
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:56,397
A FRENCH CLIMATE MODELER CALLED

225
00:06:56,398 --> 00:06:57,865
THE ART AND SCIENCE OF CLIMATE

226
00:06:57,866 --> 00:06:59,801
MODEL TUNING.

227
00:06:59,802 --> 00:07:02,470
AND IN IT, HE SPEAKS OF

228
00:07:02,471 --> 00:07:03,004
PARAMETERIZING.

229
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,840
WE COULD SAY FUDGING, THE

230
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:09,344
MODELS TO GIVE, HIS WORDS, AN

231
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:12,380
ANTICIPATED ACCEPTABLE RANGE OF

232
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:12,747
RESULTS.

233
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:16,050
SO IT'S THE SCIENTIST, NOT THE

234
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:18,252
SCIENCE THAT'S DETERMINING HOW

235
00:07:18,253 --> 00:07:19,787
MUCH IT'S GOING TO WARM.

236
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:20,788
LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS,

237
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:23,758
BUT IT HAPPENS TO BE TRUE, AND

238
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,027
YOU KNOW, WE COULD SPECULATE AS

239
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:29,163
TO WHY THAT PAPER WAS PUBLISHED

240
00:07:29,164 --> 00:07:31,966
RIGHT BEFORE THE 2016 ELECTION?

241
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:34,736
I WOULDN'T WANT TO IMPUTE

242
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:35,570
CAUSATION, BUT GEE --

243
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:36,804
MARK: BUT I WANT TO ASK YOU

244
00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:38,006
ABOUT CAUSATION.

245
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:38,973
>> SURE.

246
00:07:38,974 --> 00:07:40,908
MARK: HAVE YOU 31 GOVERNMENTS.

247
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:43,144
>> THE 31 DIFFERENT MODELS.

248
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:45,680
>> 31 DIFFERENT MODELS.

249
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:46,280
MULTIPLE GOVERNMENTS.

250
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:46,647
>> RIGHT.

251
00:07:46,648 --> 00:07:49,017
MARK: FUDGING THE NUMBERS?

252
00:07:49,018 --> 00:07:50,985
>> NOT FUDGING THEM

253
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:51,452
PARAMETERIZING.

254
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:54,522
MARK: YOU USED THE WORD

255
00:07:54,523 --> 00:07:54,889
FUDGING.

256
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,924
DOES OUR EPA DO THAT?

257
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:57,959
DOES NASA DO THAT?

258
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,360
WHO DOES THAT FOR US?

259
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:03,131
>> GOOD QUESTION, MARK, BECAUSE

260
00:08:03,132 --> 00:08:05,233
THE EPA WAS TOLD BY THE SUPREME

261
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,902
COURT IN 2007 THAT IF IT FOUND

262
00:08:07,903 --> 00:08:09,971
THE CARBON DIOXIDE ENDANGERED

263
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:10,938
HUMAN HEALTH AND WELFARE, THAT

264
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:12,940
IT HAD THE POWER TO REGULATE IT

265
00:08:12,941 --> 00:08:14,809
UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT.

266
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,411
MARK: THIS IS THE

267
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:16,844
MASSACHUSETTS.

268
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:18,446
>> THE EPA.

269
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:19,847
WELL, THEY PRODUCED AN

270
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:22,183
ENDANGERMENT FINDING, 2009, AND

271
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:26,120
THE ENDANGERMENT FINDING FOR

272
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:27,955
PROSPECTIVE CLIMATE IS 100%, I

273
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:29,257
DIDN'T SAY 90%.

274
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,660
I SAID 100% BASED ON THOSE

275
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,060
MODELS.

276
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:35,229
SO IF YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT

277
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,964
THOSE MODELS SYSTEMATICALLY ARE

278
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:40,368
NOT WORKING, YOU CAN TAKE DOWN

279
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:43,271
THE ENDANGERMENT FINDING, AND

280
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,506
THAT WOULD BE THE BASIS FOR ALL

281
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:47,241
THOSE POLICIES THAT CAME OUT OF

282
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:47,942
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.

283
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:49,310
MARK: WHICH WOULD MEAN YOU

284
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:52,747
DON'T GET TO REGULATE --

285
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:53,214
>> ABSOLUTELY.

286
00:08:53,215 --> 00:08:53,915
MARK: -- CARBON DIOXIDE.

287
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,184
>> ABSOLUTELY, THE ENDANGERMENT

288
00:08:56,185 --> 00:08:58,352
FINDING IS THE HEART OF THE

289
00:08:58,353 --> 00:08:58,719
MATTER.

290
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,854
TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA HOW GUNG HO

291
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:01,155
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS ON

292
00:09:01,156 --> 00:09:03,191
THIS ISSUE.

293
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:04,859
IF YOU LISTEN TO HIS FIRST

294
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,862
INAUGURAL SPEECH, JANUARY 20,

295
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:09,630
2009, IT'S SECOND SUBSTANTIVE

296
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,166
PARAGRAPH OF THE SPEECH IS

297
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,301
ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING, AFTER

298
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,702
HEALTH CARE.

299
00:09:14,703 --> 00:09:16,204
90 DAYS AFTER HE FINISHED THAT

300
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:18,606
SPEECH, HIS EPA PRODUCED A

301
00:09:18,607 --> 00:09:20,708
PRELIMINARY FINDING OF

302
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:21,542
ENDANGERMENT FROM CARBON

303
00:09:21,543 --> 00:09:21,943
DIOXIDE.

304
00:09:21,944 --> 00:09:24,445
THEY WERE WORKING ON THIS

305
00:09:24,446 --> 00:09:27,648
BEFORE HE WAS PRESIDENT,

306
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:29,317
BUREAUCRATS CAN'T WORK THAT

307
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,486
FAST, AND THEN THE FINAL

308
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,122
FINDING WAS MADE IN DECEMBER

309
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:36,357
FOR THE CLIMATE CONFERENCE IN

310
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:38,025
COPENHAGEN THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO

311
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:38,826
PRODUCE ANOTHER GLOBAL WARMING.

312
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:42,797
MARK: SO YOU'RE TELLING US THAT

313
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:45,500
WE HAVE A MASSIVE BIT OF PUBLIC

314
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,469
POLICY THAT HAS ENORMOUS EFFECT

315
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,071
ON SOCIETY THAT'S BUILT ON --

316
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:52,240
I'LL USE MY WORDS, PHONY

317
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:52,607
MODELS.

318
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:55,476
>> BUILT ON A HOUSE OF CARDS.

319
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:57,245
MODELS REALLY DON'T WORK.

320
00:09:57,246 --> 00:10:00,181
IF I COULD REALLY BE ARCANE, I

321
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,049
COULD EXPLAIN THE MECHANISM AS

322
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,718
TO WHY THEY DON'T WORK.

323
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:04,585
MARK: AS LONG AS I UNDERSTAND

324
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:04,852
IT.

325
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:06,454
>> THE MODELS SYSTEMATICALLY

326
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:07,989
PREDICT THAT AS YOU GO UP IN

327
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:10,091
THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE TROPICS

328
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:11,959
WHICH ARE 40% OF THE EARTH THAT

329
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,528
THE TEMPERATURE SHOULD RISE

330
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,029
DRAMATICALLY AS YOU GO FURTHER

331
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,364
UP IN THE ATMOSPHERE.

332
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,566
SO WHEN YOU GET TO THE LEVEL OF

333
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:21,602
THE JET STREAM, THE COMPUTER

334
00:10:21,603 --> 00:10:24,138
MODELS ARE PREDICTING SEVEN

335
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:24,438
TIMES.

336
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:27,608
I DIDN'T SAY SEVEN-TENTHS OF A

337
00:10:27,609 --> 00:10:29,177
DEGREE, I SAID SEVEN TIMES MORE

338
00:10:29,178 --> 00:10:32,480
WARMING THAN BEING OBSERVED.

339
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:35,216
WHY AM I BORING YOU WITH THAT?

340
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,718
THE VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF

341
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:39,020
TEMPERATURE DETERMINES

342
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:40,521
PRECIPITATION, AND GUESS WHAT?

343
00:10:40,522 --> 00:10:42,757
ALMOST ALL THE ATMOSPHERIC

344
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:45,459
MOISTURE THAT WE HAVE AROUND US

345
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,327
TODAY IN THE HUMID WASHINGTON,

346
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:48,296
D.C., THAT COMES FROM THE

347
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:48,763
TROPICS.

348
00:10:48,764 --> 00:10:49,997
SO IF YOU GET THAT VERTICAL

349
00:10:49,998 --> 00:10:53,034
MOTION WRONG, DOWN THERE, YOU

350
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:54,335
GET ALL THE SUBSEQUENT

351
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:55,236
VARIABLES WRONG.

352
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,338
IT'S A FANTASTIC SYSTEMATIC

353
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:58,839
ERROR, AND AGAIN, THAT ALONG

354
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,375
WITH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

355
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:03,511
SURFACE TEMPERATURES ARE RATHER

356
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:07,215
THE LOWER ATMOSPHERIC

357
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:09,183
TEMPERATURES THAN WHAT'S BEING

358
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:09,984
OBSERVED, THAT'S SUFFICIENT TO

359
00:11:09,985 --> 00:11:11,519
THE CHEMICAL FINDING.

360
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,486
MARK: TO THE AVERAGE PEDESTRIAN

361
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:14,922
LIKE ME, IF YOU GET THAT WRONG,

362
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:16,557
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

363
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:18,960
YOU GET THE WEATHER MODELS

364
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:19,260
WRONG?

365
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:19,927
>> THE SUBSEQUENT WEATHER

366
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:20,228
WRONG.

367
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:21,929
THAT'S WHY, IF YOU LOOK AT ALL

368
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,967
THESE FAMILIES OF MODELS, THEY

369
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:27,235
PREDICT RADICALLY DIFFERENT

370
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:28,069
CHANGES IN PRECIPITATION FROM

371
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,637
MODEL TO MODEL.

372
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:33,274
WELL, PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY GOT

373
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:33,808
THE PRECIPITATION

374
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:36,644
INITIALIZATION OUT OF TROPICS

375
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:36,944
WRONG.

376
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:38,145
PRECIPITATION IS IMPORTANT.

377
00:11:38,146 --> 00:11:42,250
I OFFER YOU WILMINGTON, NORTH

378
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:43,818
CAROLINA, IF AN EXAMPLE

379
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:44,518
PRECIPITATION IS IMPORTANT

380
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:46,053
COMING FROM THE TROPICS, GET

381
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:47,255
THAT WRONG AND YOU GET THAT

382
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:47,555
THING.

383
00:11:47,556 --> 00:11:51,058
>> IS WEATHER GETTING WORSE?

384
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:52,293
>> NO.

385
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,294
I LOVE THAT QUESTION BECAUSE

386
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,330
WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO LOOK

387
00:11:56,331 --> 00:11:58,799
AT.

388
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,668
ROGER PILKE, JR., AT THE

389
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:02,069
UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DOES.

390
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,671
THIS YES, THERE'S MORE DAMAGE

391
00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:04,872
FROM WEATHER BECAUSE THERE'S

392
00:12:04,873 --> 00:12:06,073
MORE STUFF AND PEOPLE AND

393
00:12:06,074 --> 00:12:07,975
PROPERTY IN THE WAY OF WEATHER.

394
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:09,543
SO WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO LOOK

395
00:12:09,544 --> 00:12:12,046
AT ARE WEATHER DAMAGES AS A

396
00:12:12,047 --> 00:12:13,614
PERCENT OF GDP.

397
00:12:13,615 --> 00:12:17,118
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THAT WAY,

398
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,185
THERE'S NOTHING WHATSOEVER.

399
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:20,121
I'M SURE HURRICANES ARE GETTING

400
00:12:20,122 --> 00:12:20,421
WORSE.

401
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:24,892
I HEARD THAT ON EVERY LEGACY

402
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:26,460
NETWORK DURING FLORENCE AND

403
00:12:26,461 --> 00:12:28,396
HARVEY AND ALL THAT STUFF.

404
00:12:28,397 --> 00:12:30,264
WELL, FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

405
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:32,600
THERE'S A GUY BY THE NAME OF

406
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:37,238
RYAN MAUI, A HOT SHOT YOUNG

407
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:39,340
TROPICAL METEOROLOGIST, AND A

408
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,609
SCHOLAR AT THE CATO INSTITUTE.

409
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,744
HE TRACKS THE ENERGY IN THE

410
00:12:43,745 --> 00:12:45,479
TROPICAL CYCLONES.

411
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,814
SINCE WE GOT GLOBAL RECORDS

412
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:50,651
THAT BEGAN IN 1970, AND YOU

413
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:52,153
WOULD THINK THERE WOULD BE SOME

414
00:12:52,154 --> 00:12:54,588
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT

415
00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:55,556
INTEGRATED ENERGY AND GLOBAL

416
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:59,760
WARMING AFTER ALL, IT'S ONLY

417
00:12:59,761 --> 00:13:00,094
LOGICAL.

418
00:13:00,095 --> 00:13:00,861
VICE PRESIDENT GORE SAYS THAT

419
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:03,931
MUST BE THE CASE.

420
00:13:03,932 --> 00:13:05,399
IT'S NOT.

421
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,701
THERE'S NO RELATIONSHIP

422
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,470
WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THE

423
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:10,671
ACCUMULATED CYCLONE ENERGY AND

424
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:12,273
THE SURFACE TEMPERATURE OF THE

425
00:13:12,274 --> 00:13:12,707
EARTH.

426
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,175
IT'S JUST NOT THERE.

427
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:16,644
NOW, WHAT -- WAIT A MINUTE, J

428
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:19,213
DOES OUR GOVERNMENT SAY THIS?

429
00:13:19,214 --> 00:13:22,450
THEY SAID IT IN THEIR LAST

430
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:23,217
REPORT CALLED GLOBAL CLIMATE

431
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:24,385
CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED

432
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:24,719
STATES.

433
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,954
THEY SAID, OH, THERE'S BEEN A

434
00:13:26,955 --> 00:13:29,223
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN

435
00:13:29,224 --> 00:13:31,058
HURRICANE POWER IN THE ATLANTIC

436
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:33,828
OCEAN FROM 1970 TO 2009 OR

437
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:35,396
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

438
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,465
1980 TO 2009.

439
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:37,932
WAIT A MINUTE.

440
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:40,167
WHY DID YOU STOP IN 2009.

441
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:41,869
IT'S 2014 REPORT.

442
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,872
BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE THE DATA

443
00:13:44,873 --> 00:13:47,007
AFTER 2009, THE INCREASE GOES

444
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:48,376
BACK TO WHERE IT WAS.

445
00:13:48,377 --> 00:13:50,544
WHY DID YOU START IN THE MID

446
00:13:50,545 --> 00:13:52,413
1970s, BECAUSE WE HAVE RECORDS

447
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,781
THAT ARE REALLY GOOD BACK TO

448
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:54,248
1920.

449
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:56,650
IF YOU LOOK AT 1920 TO 1950,

450
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:58,352
YOU SEE AN INCREASE THAT IS

451
00:13:58,353 --> 00:14:00,588
EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ONE

452
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,822
THAT OCCURS.

453
00:14:01,823 --> 00:14:03,023
MARK: SO THE INFORMATION

454
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:04,725
THEY'RE PROVIDING US --

455
00:14:04,726 --> 00:14:06,560
>> IS SKEWED.

456
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:07,061
IT'S SKEWED.

457
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:09,663
THEY'RE CHERRY PICKING.

458
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:12,867
MARK: HERE WE RELY ON THE

459
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:14,301
CLIMATOLOGISTS AND THEY ARE

460
00:14:14,302 --> 00:14:14,769
HYPERPOLITICAL.

461
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,104
TONIGHT GET BACK TO THAT AS

462
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:17,872
SOON AS WE RETURN.

463
00:14:17,873 --> 00:14:20,207
>>> DON'T FORGET, LADIES AND

464
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,009
GENTLEMEN, YOU CAN WATCH LEVIN
