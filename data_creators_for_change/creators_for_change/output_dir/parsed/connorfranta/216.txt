yeah hey what's up you guys it's Connor
and am in a spinny chair okay everyone
so this week we're gonna get a little
personal I'm going to be digging deep
within my brain and bringing out some
past memories for you guys but so the
topic of this video is death morbid I
know I'm going to be telling about the
many times in my life that I have almost
died we've all had these experiences oh
my god today hugs almost died like me
and death were stuffs closed today for
sure one of my first memories of a
near-death experience is when I got
stitches right here on my forehead I
don't know if you can see it I have
stitches in the shape of a see bidding
but yes so the story goes something like
this
when I was younger I was playing tag
next to a dark parking lot having such a
good time of course yeah until I was
running running running looked back to
see if someone was chasing me saw them
looked forward and hit a no parking sign
I repeat I hit a no parking sign with my
face I don't think I was the brightest
child but yes and basically my head
exploded and I got blood everywhere but
you know I lived another time a couple
years later I was riding my bike down
the middle of the road again not the
brightest child and the story goes I was
on my way to the pool so I had a
swimming towel and for some reason I
flipped the towel over the front of the
bike it got caught in the bike wheel and
I literally flipped forward smacking
both my face and every other part of my
body on the pavement yeah I found the
story kind of funny because I proceeded
to lay in the middle of the road and be
like and my friends were like okay we
know it hurts but you need to like get
out of the middle of the road because
there's sort of cars coming and stuff
yeah way to go Conor way to go another
time I was tired happen to be biking
again but I had nothing to do with the
bikes so basically me and my family were
biking on a bike trail and we stopped
for a little break it just so happened
that the exact spot we stopped at there
was a rattlesnake I do not I literally
almost stepped on it but I got away no
danger over here
you know that also happen to be one of
those moments where I like ran away and
not realizing what just happened and
then like two minutes later it hit me
and I freaked out oh my god oh my god
that was die at times good times moving
on to more recent times so there I was
in the backseat of the car while my
sister was driving it was a cold winter
about I'd say 2009 everything was going
great until we hit black ice ran into
the side of a bridge ran into the other
side of the bridge and then went into
the ditch I remember very clearly that
when she hit the brakes and we slid I
hit my head against the window don't
worry I was a hundred than fine but it
was kind of funny right now I don't know
I feel like every near-death experience
is funny later on in life I got away but
I totally almost died yeah and a very
more so recent deer death experience on
my road trip to California this summer
we kind of ran out of gas and it kind of
was in the middle of the desert and it
was in the middle of the summer so it
was really hot really sunny and I don't
even think we have water foods what do
we do now after some reason I was really
calm like the dumbass I am I got in the
middle of the road and I took this
selfie hashtag stranded Connor now is
not the time really really my life but
some more everyday occurrences for me I
pretty much almost died every time I see
a spider
I used to die just a little bit every
time we had a lecture in school and the
biggest cause of death still gets me
almost every day is boredom I almost
died from boredom I have nothing to do
but sleep oh well ah God there's
something wrong with me but okay you
