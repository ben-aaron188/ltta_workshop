okay so hey what's up you guys it's
Connor and if you follow me on Twitter
you've noticed that things have been a
little different lately I haven't been
as positive as I usually am I pretty
negative and just kind of down in
general it's because I've been like
hiding something from you guys and I
really I really just need to get it off
my chest and tell you so this has been
going on for a while now it's not
something new it's not something that
just came up I've thought about this for
a while I've talked to my family I've
talked to my friends and really there's
only like one thing that keeps coming up
and something I keep coming back to yeah
it's you know it's really hard I mean
it's really hard to tell you guys
something I know you don't want to hear
but I just I've got to say it I've got
to get it off my chest
it's literally driving me insane I think
about it all the time and I can't stop
thinking about it see if you don't know
already I'm a full-time college student
and a full-time to sport varsity athlete
and with this youtube stuff I don't have
much of a social life I mean it takes up
so much time I don't even know if
however you realize it and lately it's
really been bothering me so it's really
hard I'm I'm quitting I'm not quitting
anything

today and um I had to get you did I get
you huh who's crying who's crying what
those tears away I'm totally kidding I'm
not quitting YouTube don't worry about
it but I really do need to tell you guys
the truth as the title says really the
truth is I'm yeah there's a guy you

not wearing socks in a video it's not
gonna be a serious video I have a wolf
on my shirt so you know that's pretty
cool okay really I just wanted to point
that out it has nothing to do with the
conversation at all oh well you want
shame on me will you twice you're a
dumbass mmm I don't think that's how it
goes
but real talk there is a lot of change
going on in my life and I'm sure there's
a lot of change going on in yours I've
been busier but cheer
more edgy McCadden yeah I should
probably just stick to YouTube but
speaking of YouTube one big thing I did
for it is I went to playlist live in
Orlando Florida spring break it was
amazing so much fun I bet so many of you

like did you guys were like and then I
was like and on top of all that I got to
make some new YouTube friends and meet

little crazier and a little more weird
