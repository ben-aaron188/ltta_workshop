hey what's up everyone so this week I'm
gonna do something just a little bit
different I'm actually just filming this
on my phone we're gonna film this very
real very raw little bit whispery so
this week I'm doing something that is
totally out of my character a little fun
fact about me I have never really done
anything to alter myself
I've never gotten surgery I've never
gotten a tattoo I've never gotten up
here saying I've never even dyed my hair
today I'm actually going to go do one of
those things it is such a small thing
for most people but I've never done it
so I'm really excited today I'm gonna go
get my ear pierced that's it I'm gonna
go get my ear pierced and I'm really
excited because I'm again I've never
done anything like this before so and I
just I don't know to expect I'm excited
I thought I'd fill it for you guys cuz
it's kind of like a life moment why not
let's do it a lot of you have been
wondering why I like already seem like I
have an ear piercing it's because I've
been wearing a fake ear piercing for
like a month now this is the one right
here it's like a little clasp and I've
been wearing it because I didn't know if
I wanted my ear to be pierced so I just
went out one random night found a place
that was selling fake earrings put one
in and I loved it I don't I loved it
good so fun every morning when I got to
put it back on I was so excited and
that's how I knew I wanted to get it for
real so I'm gonna bring you guys with me
let's go
holy shit I did it it didn't even hurt
you told me to carve it I'd like that's
like a rite of passage that you have to
hold someone's hand while you do things
like this I wish I could have gotten
like a hoop
I almost got a lightning bolt but I
wanted to get a hoop or something but
apparently can't do that first time but
look at that I'm so excited I'm yep I'm
still obsessed I'm looking oh look how
red my ear is oh my god and that's
really hot okay I'm gonna finish this
later
I just got back home oh don't look at
that look at it I am so excited oh my
gosh I really do wish I could have
gotten a hoop or I almost gotta like I
said I almost got a lightning bolt but I
thought I'd just go super plain and
simple for for now and then you know
I'll update it later and my ears really
red because he was like clamping it so
for anyone who hasn't gotten up here
saying it was also interesting because
I've never been with someone to get a
piercing I've never been to get a fear
seeing myself they have a whole case of
just different earrings you can get like
they have really cheap ones really
expensive ones and then you just pick
one and then you feel like sign your
life away and for this particular one
you couldn't film on the inside so I was
like well I'm already here sadly I can't
film but it was like quick I filled out
the form I walked to the back he heated
up all of the materials like he heated
up the earring he heated up the needle
he heared heated up everything so that
like it sanitized it and then he clamped
my ear stuck me and I was done it took
like two seconds I'm also just so
surprised because it didn't it didn't
even hurt I it like I feel like I've
heard people build it up that like you
feel a pinch or I don't know that it
like hurts a little bit but for me it
honestly didn't hurt I don't know I
think the only part that hurt was the
process after
words like not the actual piercing part
but maybe like taking out the needle I
couldn't see what was going on I don't
know though frog happened so if you're
if you're getting this pierced it
doesn't hurt all the rest I don't know I
mean like I'm assuming that that would
hurt real bad there was a girl that I
met afterwards it was getting her septum
pierced I'm like no I did it it's you oh
I'm so excited I'm so excited I did
something it is so out of my character
this is like a bucket list thing for me
I was oh my god the guy I put a hole in
my body what does it look like on this
can I do that is that kind of like hurt
it this is the most unflattering angle
in the world BAM
