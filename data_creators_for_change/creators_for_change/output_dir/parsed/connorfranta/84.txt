music taste we like music smokes a
little so basically uh Marcus and I are

so this is who knows the top 50 songs
and world the best game game can go oh
oh we need rules how deep I could throw
up okay so my buzzing noises - huh oh my
god okay whoever buzzes first you got me
the judges whoever buzzes first you go
say okay you tell me I just rather than
shouting out oh god I'm stressed already
at this game ready yeah ha ha you first

me Pete it's the time run out he'll give
me 5 seconds run away No get away
no she lent just money or no money no no
no no money Oh point eight well I guess
no points each because we both got half
or does that mean I get it no no okay
now here's how we'll do it get half a
point you're the artist halftime of the

you have to do it's gonna be right here
I'm gonna be keeping track as an editor
on I'm going best dad I know I'm to blow
boom 50 as well this is hard I know I'm
there's gonna be some that I actually

try and make people feel mad for you ah
work from home fit harmony gun does done
then I was alive I believe it's tied if
that was a sprint race you'd need that
the finish line um I just I all I hear
is the sound of a tie so let's just calm
