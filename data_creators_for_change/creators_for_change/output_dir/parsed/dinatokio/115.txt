there you go thank you so what this is
really hot tea oh I've got some Queen
Earl Grey tea here in my Kylie Minogue
mug in my Kylie Minogue glasses anyway
just before Christmas Sid and I got to
go to the launch event of Kylie
Minogue's I wear collection I'm a bit
late so we go in
Liat did with me is off oh nice
hi dude hi so let's go in it was at the
Claridge's Hotel it was the first time
I'd been there because I'm not much of a
posh nosh you see it was very fancy
fancy let me just talk about why I wore
first of all think of it without that
Claridge is I thought let me make a bit
of an effort obviously so this is one
wearing this is the cloakroom whether we
can do this all right
oh my decided to wear really nice
roughly trousers and in dark navy dress
paired with it and I wore this really
nice time auntie choker but I got so
many compliments for so we went inside
went to the cloakroom put our coats away
in fact they were separate cloakroom
there's one for ladies and one for the
Sun the men's nakum's that way though so
said bye-bye
when inside had a good old mingle we got
to have a look at the full collection
which consists of 30 pieces altogether
25 optical glasses and five sunglasses
that was the second most fun part of the
night please to love and look at these
back they're amazing
we spent ages trying on almost every
single pair that they had there oh that
right I ended up trying the pair's I'm
wearing now guys I might not me
the rest of the event and of the pilot
pilot like Eileen actually chose these
because you can't disagree they look
fabulous on me I'm going to run again
but the way that they had the collection
displayed was super cool it was almost
like honeycomb display with the glasses
in each one
they were honestly so many glasses that
I was absolutely drooling over let's say
I decide I neveri want them all but
these ones for now I decided to get
these at the ends because to me these
are classic they suit my face I love it
when they're a pair of glasses with a
clear frame eliteness these ones in
particular are the Kiley 13 glasses
these are a champagne acetate if I just
come up a little closer you can see that
hint of champagne around my eyes I just
think I mean listen I could talk all day
about how much I love these glasses but
instead I'll just wear them with almost
every outfit but there were so many
glasses that I really wanted to Nick but
seeing is where the Claridge's obviously
I wasn't going to Nick anything right
also it's illegal what I did manage to
do is take a selfie with every pair that
I like so what out for those pictures on
Instagram to date anyway after having a
look at the whole collection and meeting
new people and trying very interesting
canapes we were all led into the main
room where we actually got to see the
collection in action in a fashion show
posted by the one and only Emma Willis
can see the preview of the Connie knows
I won't mention spectators one
aerated practice that will appeal to
stylish concert women they wanted a true
global fashion icon
obviously Kylie know for that person not
typically expected as well you can
either to a 90 day and six apart in
Europe to collect a secret service that
is 25 optical and 5 sunglasses and there
it looks absolutely enter each occasion
and reason to finish supple modern
classics and all of the styles have a
sense of elegance and femininity here
though is quick taster as what you are
asking there were three categories that
all blinged reinvented vintage and
modern classics by far my favorite was
the reinventing about that I thought my
favorites were the reinvented vintage
glasses they were just a hundred percent
döner written all over them except they
had kindly written all over them because
obviously they can't even Oh glasses
ha shisha was amazing it was so fun to
watch really lively really upbeat the
atmosphere was above them then once it
was over Kylie Minogue herself came out
audience got to chat with her and Emma
willand where she talked to us about the
collection how she got to designing it
her love for glasses and all things
frames I'm very very proud of his room
his glasses are at the Parkway of their
lives and if you could pick anyone who
would not be wearing a bucket decide to
use because I learn me um it's a Queen
of England
commencing a victory round if you
shorted out 11 amazing time of night I
know my my phone is very much looking
forward to choosing probably one of
everything from the range I'm a Roman
citizen any family has verses yes always
boy thank you for being with us today I
mostly find something that you like on
the city walls thank you very much
it was so fabulous to see her in real
life she's very genuine very
down-to-earth as he went on the stage
when everything was done and had a
cheeky photo session there you know
whenever you find perfect location guys
from Instagram opportunity you must take
it so I did
obviously Kylie Minogue is a fashion
icon actually inspires so many women not
just through her music but also through
her Styles you've got very very classic
look and that really really came across
in her glasses even if it wasn't
something I might particularly choose
there was something very classy about
every single pair I also really loved
how much of a variety the collection has
and I feel like Kylie managed to cater
for all women with this collection which
is I think something that's actually
quite hard to do but Kylie I respect
savers managed to do that together
pretty well if you asked me a lot of the
glasses are also designed specifically
for petite faces because Kylie herself
is quite petite so obviously she felt
that that was something that was much
needed we also got to meet the
Specsavers team and they were so lovely
they really have great van I'm very very
accommodating which is always a bonus
when you go to these things unit we have
some more time mingling I confirmed what
glasses I wanted which are these babies
over here the candy 13 remember the
style for when they launched on the 14th
of February then we have to go so on the
way out I got a goodie bag mate - goodie
bag once a dude but what's it gonna do

what I would do is open the goody bags
