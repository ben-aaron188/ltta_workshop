is like the engine is on fire I thought
you were joking oh my gosh
bro dude that could literally the whole
van we could have lost the whole van der
stone oh dude we could have just been up
in in flame imagine if we were climbing
a hill and we just have to like bail can
we use group can we just group group as
we're alive for a life bully oh my god
you're shaking right you're shaking
magistrate get into a restaurant
hold the freaking fire extinguisher off
of the wall oh my god what are you going
to do I'm going to I might try and drive
it back if it turns over really yeah
are you going the keys so the others
have jumped in the the fire guy's car
and
I'm gonna take the one the bug for a
little little cruise up this hill I
think and then we're going to be fine
guys he's saying just beyond here the
air gets a lot cooler just put some
fresh oil in there I think she just got
a little bit too hot and
and over here I don't think there's any
problems and we just take it nice and
easy now
I've got to say I panicked a little bit
when I saw the fire and then when I saw
when I opened up and saw the plastic I
was like this isn't this isn't serious
damage
we're absolutely
she's just cruising up these hills now
yay it's running fine bro yep you girls
want to get in here run inside so Marco
and Dave have come to save the day
markers joining me for the drive back
I'm not sure that's why I said yeah when
we pulled up everyone was like we're
outta here
and look at the girls a bit a bit shaken
up I think we're fine we just need to
take it real easy but we're luckily
they're behind us they can cruise bind
us Louie you are the eternal optimist
yeah I'm saying though I think I don't
think this is one of those situations
where I'm not taking reality into again
I think I'm just give live gumption I
think the word gumption is like oh we're
going we're there were there okay well
we have successfully arrived or Airbnb
with no further problems as I suspected
it was just an unfortunate set of
circumstances that caused the fire
and the and the panic but Oh
all is well we're just unloading now and
setting down for the night this caught
us five I've been up editing I'm still
trying to catch shot myself seal it with
if going on a road trip but I'm doing my
best and I'm glad the one the bugs still
on the road surviving we're going to try
and pop into the mechanics tomorrow just
to double-check everything or crazy
night catch in the morning peace out
enjoy life and the adventure but
