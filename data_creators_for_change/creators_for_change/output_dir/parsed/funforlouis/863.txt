picture of Louise right here as I bends
over my quad bulge out he's got very big
muscley legs and it's all my jeans but
then everybody advised me I'm not gonna
be able to sew him up so I thought I'd
cut them to make jean shorts Roy ever
brokeback that might sound and
apparently I've gone a bit too high and
now we're gonna be more like just a flat
so as much as I want to be an optimist
