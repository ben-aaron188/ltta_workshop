about a lot of things sleep well night
guys
right back my parents after a long
evening with Nick and and working on
some secret projects which I may be able
to tell you guys about seen but not yet
and I love hanging out those too and I'm
sure you've seen from in my videos they
are both super cool and I just wanted to
tell you guys that they inspire me I see
a lot of like bad relationships around
me and as a married couple they inspire
me it encourages me gives me hope that
one day when I get married marriage
could be pretty fun and pretty cool
which it doesn't always happen like like
that you know and I see people in very
controlling and restrictive kind of
relationships say no I don't know it's
good what I'm saying is it's good and it
was also fantastic to hang out with
Jackson I haven't seen him in like like
the night mumps like months probably
VidCon it's cool to hear waves up to
your projects he's doing he's about I
should have charged him or earlier but
we were just like deep in conversation
but he's doing this cool Skype
collaboration project where he's gonna
be filming some different documentaries
and stuff I'm sure you or some of you
may have seen his latest video
announcing that and we I don't know we
were just saying that even though we
don't see each other for ages we still
can just pick up from where we left off
you know we can just there's no
weirdness with our friendship you know
it's cool even a real child among some
months months
but we hopefully will get to hang out a
bit more regularly and do some fun
travel projects together we're just
trying to figure out how that can all
come together and fit together with our
to the crazy schedules but overall great
day
with great friends and tomorrow another
great day
I hope capture their peace out into her
life and live the adventure
