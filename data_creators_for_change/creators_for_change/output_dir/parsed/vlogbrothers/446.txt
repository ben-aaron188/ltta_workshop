I've decided that I would have a lower
third how about this no that's that's
just for farts I briefly heard that you
guys promised that she would eat a bowl
of crickets if we raised $10,000 bunchy
that's a lot of fingers happening now oh
good as I can do I guess I probably
should have unzipped it my mom does not
know who you are
if you donate $10,000 in the next hour
Sara and I are going to cover our faces
in peanut butter but I got to take off
my shirt if I'm gonna dance this is the
perfect opportunity to confess my love
for John Durr
keep your Batman mask on though so you
can be the masked Avenger oh never do
this unless you have explicit permission
how about my cheek is that enough or
should we do more so this group I had
this was a phase of time when I didn't
have a beard just to let you know we're
talking about but it's a hiney I dare ya
donk a donk is my favorite that's the
scientific term we're just a hundred and
sixty dollars away from a million Hank
so when we get to a million grace is
gonna dress up like a Christmas tree and
Sarah is gonna do my makeup and you can
do whatever you want it seems to me that
the donations have slowed dramatic

able to donate in nine minutes we just
