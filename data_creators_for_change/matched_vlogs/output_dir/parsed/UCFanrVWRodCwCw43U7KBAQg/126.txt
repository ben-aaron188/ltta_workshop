dollars I think $25 cloven challenge
from eBay but this time is from related
but haven't seen this before and I am
slightly nervous because I know a lot of
things on eBay tend to look completely
different in your life and I feel like a
prom dress is normally quite expensive
so I don't know how you managed to get a
prom out there for $25 what I could say
is good luck like nothing we're the ones
that should be now yeah I do know who's
gonna win I am NOT nervous whatsoever I
have to know like I won the other
challenge of one bet if I were the magic
in when the other challenge if I change
it half because even if mumbles and I so
like yours could look worse in real life
yeah so it's like I don't know who's
gonna win half a wine bottle nicer or
nearby and in real life well we don't
know yet they haven't even opened up the
parcels so they can open up the parcels
