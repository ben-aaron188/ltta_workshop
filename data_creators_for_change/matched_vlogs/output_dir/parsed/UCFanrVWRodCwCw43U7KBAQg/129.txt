hi everyone and welcome back to my
channel I hope you guys is danger so for
today's video I'm going to be doing a
get ready with me
understand so I be requested ever since
I got my last one like or actually
really mm-hmm
the almost forever ago now I didn't last
get ready with me I've done was on New
Year's Eve so such a long time ago but
ever since then that you guys have been
requesting for me to another and tabs
events festival seasons coming up and
high pots so many festivals to attend I
thought why don't do it get rid of me
like a flexible Cannella because yeah
and I need to practice mermaid cobbler
I'm not actually going anywhere today
but I thought like oh practice my hair
press my makeup just so when I go I'm
like fully prepared and I know exactly
what I want of it like I guess so nice
for my hair and really quickly run
through I pretty much just got like a
half up half down garment people at my
favorite things ever because certainly
you get to the hair like out of your way
so it's so like it feels so nice but
then your hair so down you don't look
like particularly like board like scrape
back and then I just put like a few like
cats and stuff with the hair as well I
pretty draw everyone could do a plat so
yeah this is pretty much what I've done
with my hair I'm going to run for it
today everything I'm going to be doing
with my makeup and I've also got like
glitter and stuff that I only do as well
so like it's pretty exciting if you guys
enjoy this video then please smash I
like it or to subscribe down below if
you guys haven't already as that further
ado let's get into the video wonderful
my grandma I'm going to be using the
illuminating makeup Primark by nuna the
reason I chose to use this one is
because it's four vessels I love like
wearing glitter and I'd love like a
little highlight and I feel like it's an
excuse to wear so I highlight so I
thought this plan will be great as
obviously illuminating so it kind of
gives me that extra shine under my
foundation also it's a pretty good
primer as well because it does make your
makeup last quite long and also feels
like moisture
thing on your face and also another
bonus that's pretty affordable so I just
saw a win-win my face either like a
straining goddess right now I know so
shiny and I do just want to say I I
don't know what is I feel like I stated
every single makeup video but whenever I
going to film a makeup video my skin
decides to break out I don't know why I
was up this morning I was like why the
daytime so many get ready as made of my
skin happens like this so please excuse
it but for foundation I'm going to go in
with the unique of your affection and by
nation this is one of my favorite and
I've been using this pretty much
everything good early to me so I'm just
going to go in and do my normal
foundation routine so it's going to thin
I'm going to be using my Beauty Blender
and by the way this is down because I
feel like every single time Video Maker
to have Beauty Blender people like you
know Elsa you should dump it in like I
do I did always forget to tell you that
I've dumped it but it is done okay so I
think that pretty much my foundation
blends days I wanna make sure it's
blended into my neck because as I've
said my neck is kind of a different
color to my face at the moment so I just
want to make sure that it's completely
blended what I think it is and I don't
even see comparing to I'll apply for for
foundation on this is a very high
coverage foundation it covers all my
spots well I'm still a couple shouting
but it pretty much covers majority of
them so hence where they're mrs. Anna
shade 14 vanilla it's great now I'm
going to go on with concealer to
highlight my face and I'm going to be
using the Too Faced Born This Way
concealer is quite thick but it's so
much creamy bit easy to blend I'm going
to be applying this where I always do
which is two triangles underneath my
eyes do the sides of the most on even
triangles or might highlight we're just
gonna we're going to make sure what we
got
so on the bridge of my nose are then on
the tip of my nose a little bit about my
Cupid's bow again some on my chin as
well as you can see we got a lot of chin
spots at the moment I'm giving that just
like soaked into my skin for like around
like two minutes but I want to basically
tweet on Twitter saying if there's any
questions and sprouts that you guys want
to ask me for this video then ask away
so I am going to be answering some
questions and stuff majority of the
questions are about a book and bringing
out which is stuff a bunker that is
realized which I am so flipping excited
for if you didn't know already and
bringing out a book I did like to give
like an announcement video on it so if
you haven't seen that and I warned it
back down below
I am so flipping excited because I love
what the book is about and if you want
to be another video then you will
understand what the book is about
currently our most ominous that still
some signed copies there I'm actually
going to be doing a book tour and I
basically asked in that video as well so
you guys to let me know where you want
me to come and visit so again same thing
I'm still undecided where I should go I
want to go up and down the UK like I
want to go everywhere like England
Ireland Scotland go I want to visit my
way how good is it learn it just look
like fresh as the life of Selah just
make all the difference when
highlighting your faith and then when
you contour it gives that extra life
definition because you obviously how the
highlighted point and then you know you
draw a line looks like you know you can
cut forward with it so to contour my
face I'm going to be using it be to me
chubby stick I've gone back to this this
bad boy because this is literally like
the easiest thing to use if you just
starting out makeup then this is one I
would definitely recommend to try
because this how easy it is follows what
I'm talking I just don't really like
focus very well I just like like you're
on and super excited all the festivals
I'm going to be attending though going
to wildlife or one of the days it's like
a weekend festival but I'm only going to
be there for one day or one of my
friends displays coming me okay I have
to hang out for a bit
'we can see like when it's uneven to
find it because my mask and my laptop i
Macedon file under my hat but it's going
to replace it now anyway carrying on
from what I was saying so it says a
weekend festival but I'm only going for
one day because I'm going to summer time
for the other day and I think something
like a lot on a Saturday so I think
we'll go to wildlife on me Sunday so
that is going to be like such a busy
weekend kinda more acceptable some
attending next year I'm definitely
attending Coachella
because Coachella looks like the best
fun ever
I don't do that a festival a lot and it
just looks like a Michael like vibe
everybody likes with so much glitter and
everything so glammed up and yeah I find
it very me so next year I would
definitely attend back nearly blended it
all and I'm just going to blend in in my
forehead now so that you can see how
easy it is to learn this stuff that you
just learn so nicely and it sounds like
a warm kind of bronzer like it's not too
harsh and I always say this forget it
it's just like it's one of those ones
that's just so so buildable but if you
want to get to really like to find more
cheekbones your jaw line then you could
easily do that but it's just one of
those things that's just like so
beautiful it will never kind of get
cakey we're going to using the laura
mercier setting powder this is a set
setting powder
I've ever ever used and the other kind
of paint to use in my video because how
expensive it is but I have this for
probably about eight months now and it's
pretty much full to the brim it lasts a
long time it's one of those things ivory
is worth the money
like I'm so glad I spent money on this
it is honestly amazing again I'm
literally just using my Beauty Blender
I'm just like dabbing it on the powder
and then I just go the apply this
everywhere that I applied my concealer
so it's look you can just see like under
my eye oh my goodness
sorry I jumped I saw in any filter now
apply my setting powder I'm gonna let it
like pay for my favorite
I'm 10 to 15 minutes I'm just going to
answer a few questions while it's being
would you ever consider getting a tattoo
if so what would it be and why I do
actually want tattoos when I'm older I
want kind of like a few but honestly at
this point I have no idea what I won and
I really don't see the point of getting
a tattoo if you don't know what you want
because it's going stuck there for the
rest of your life so if you're just
going to get happy the sake of it please
don't please it kind of like it makes me
cringe because a distinct life you could
hate that because like that has no
meaning to you or there's something
really simple like I don't know I know
kind of like everybody has it but I love
the simple like outline little heart you
know that everybody has on their fur or
like on the back of their neck I don't
know I think I'd be pretty cute I would
want one probably on my Stern I want one
like on my middle finger like going
through here and if they've actually
rubbed off like after I don't know a
season ten years or so and I'm just
going to buff out my power that's kind
of like start to bake on my face because
it's been about 10-ish minutes right now
twelve Russia I'm not like a huge huge
fan of Russia when it comes to festivals
I'm like yeah love a bit of blush
because it just gives like a pop of
color to your face there's one I'm
obsessing over recently and this is
benefit new one so I'm going to rosy
kind of like pale pink but how about
Goldie bits in it homework how about the
smell is but it's smells so good and I
need it to another like when you open
the pan you can immediately smell it for
Hire I'm going to be using it the Becca
moonstone highlighter just because this
is one of my favorite highlighters ever
of all effective highlighters that I
tried this one's definitely my favorite
because the other ones are more kind of
like a golden kind of shimmer and when I
have like spray tans and like Raytown
one of these can in general it does
every shot so well so why should kind of
shimmer shows up better for me I like to
apply it on the end of my nose and then
and I might build it up you know to the
bridge of my nose as you can see and
then I walk by some on my chin on my
Cupid's bow definitely this makes all
the difference
LLM class and go be applying some on the
top of my cheekbone as well because and
they're so pretty
it definitely need to be blended in and
you can see I've applied to college my
face I'm I know finding what to do the
glitter now or to do my eyeshadow I then
do the glitter afterwards I don't know
what to do if I would be more practical
to my eyes UFOs but I really want to go
into the glitter so I think I might have
to do the rest of us it's big like that
I'm going to be using and this is go get
lift up this is a song i forgiven to
when I attended like an event but this
week that is one of these so so pretty
so I've chosen it the silver glitter
today I also got glitter glue this is
one by toothpaste it is pretty good but
to be honest I think you could
definitely get better glitter glue but
this is just one that I've cut it always
hard and has been in my cupboard so I'm
going to use it anyway so one going to
do is apply some to my hand but I'm just
going to be applying the glue to the
brush and then applying the glue to my
face so pretty much everywhere that I
put the highlight I will be applying the
glitter so kind of jet flies that come
down my face I'm just going to be
brushing on the glue which looks very on
right now
but the good thing is you can see that
the glue shows up so therefore you know
exactly where you're going to be
applying the glitter but I want to kind
of do it up to my forehead a little bit
and have it just across the up so now
I'm applied to do I'm just going to be
dipped in different different now I'm
just going to be dipping my brush into
my blicket all and then yeah just a fine
anywhere
I took the glue it's so easy a lot how
effective it look it already looks so
good oh my god actually flipping lovely
stuff god I love this so much I think I
might have to fight
my face and it's actually much otherwise
I love this so much I think I am just
going to leave it it's just the one side
of my face but as you can see it looks
so pretty so effective so easy and I
felt like I have to the glitter class
because I don't know I'm used to looking
at me like you're just sitting there and
I was thinking I want to do it so it
supplies I think they're going to be
using a Mayan morphe 35o palette I have
a user in the longest time but it has
some such beautiful shades I love like
the orange II and reggaeton shadows
figures more up close so as you can see
right now I'm just blending this
everywhere on my eyelid I such it's such
a pretty Orange I didn't realize how
much shimmery it would look it has a lot
of shimmer in it and it actually looks
so pretty just the times in it I just
think makes blue eyes especially when
I'm green I just think it makes it look
so effective so I've always kind of
wanted to wear orange and I never rehab
because I've never really thought I have
up a nice orange I could use but this
palette has proved me wrong and I really
like this so I think I said that was so
easy I just put it everywhere on my
eyelid and underneath my eye and yes I
found such a pretty Orange I'm now going
to go with like this son of a darkish
orange in the corner it's very obvious
like the brightest color in the palette
I'm going to use the same brush as well
just because I'm being I feel like being
lazy today and I'm just going to put
this and it's the free supply layer you
kind of just like the meander out just
so it gives it a little bit more
definition and just makes it look a
little bit more like wow oh wow I love
this color
my friend it would be a lighter orange
I'm going to kind of do the same thing
and just apply it underneath my eye but
I think I'm just going to do the outside
of my eyes at the dark orange you know
you can kind of see like the dark orange
and then it kind of like phase into the
lighter orange which again I think is
pretty effective now now you're just
going to apply it with the same palette
again a really pretty like shimmery
white gold on the bottom like the base
of my lid it's this one here I'm now
going to go in with the brush that I've
used originally in the first place and
I'm going to be using the same like
shiny gold shimmer and just playing it
in the corner of my eye which always
looks so good oh god what is that is
that sleep I think that is and I can't
get off yeah I've had sleep in so long
so yeah I'm just going to find this in
the corner of my eye and discovering I
have so much sleep for up close we might
as well attempt a winged eyeliner and
I'm going to be using it the Rimmel
liquid in London liner going to be going
in where's the toothpaste better than
sex mascara but this is the waterproof
one because as I said you do not want
especially believe in England like it
rains a lot you do not want your makeup
going everywhere and you don't want
you'd like to get wet and you know your
mascara to beat up and down the face so
I'm going to be using a waterproof
mascara this is actually the only
waterproof mascara and own hence why I
chose it but it is a pretty good mascara
there is my mascara jar I'm going to be
clearing out the excess inside and
there's a glow but like up here and it
kinda needs my eye so I'm going to be
getting rid of that and then I'm also
gonna be applying at these backstage
lashes these are the Chelsea lashes so
I'm going to stick those on to my
eyebrows and then come back to you guys
today I put on my eyelashes and I've
done my eyebrows so I look
all better now but that was like a lot
of lb so boring to display on camera so
just quickly gather off camera now the
final thing you're going to do is my
lips so I'm going to be applying this
Mac of leapers around and this is in the
shade three basically I just imagined
used kind of matte color I want my lips
to look outline so I'm just going to
apply this all over it it's kind of like
a darkish kind of rate I'm going to do
it so we look just like the bottom done
like numbers on the top now I don't look
so purple right now want you to do this
combination in a pretty good so this is
the velvet lip cream from a pretty sure
this is from new look I look it looks so
white and wave like that but what you
kind of you blend it in your kind of put
it down exactly one of my favorite
little combos of all time and where
there's so much sometimes focus like
apply it gloss over the top I'd always
be Matt but it looks so good so the
final thing and it's actually perfect so
I've been kind of like on Instagram of
stuff I don't know what this is called
so laughs of me or whatever I don't know
what to call it
people have like this gold or silver
like shimmering line kind of like going
down their neck and it looks like so
like tumblr call while I see everybody
lipstick I'm doing it so I thought I
wanted to create my own but I have these
other two K liquid moonlight dust
shadows kind of like a felt-tip applier
so it's really easy to apply those all
this would be perfect for it so why not
give it a go so I'm just going to go
down the middle of my lips and this kind
of really matches my lip color as well
so I don't know if you can see but this
is so simple but it looks so good the
only I would say is a kind of wish I
used a different color because it
doesn't show up too well on my lip I
think a snowball would look so good
I'm kind of debating whether to put the
glitter on top of this line you know I'm
not really giving it a go wow this looks
so cool I especially love the lips
some of them are a big you look so cool
overall and I
definitely will be wearing this to my
next festival and kind of sad so like I
wish I was actually going to a festival
right now
because I love my hair and makeup so
much so I'm kind of gutted but I'm sure
I was family guys with a lot of pictures
over on my social media so you should
follow that the fit look that Cuban it
real guys here is the end of the maze of
learn and I hope you guys will enjoy it
if you need to smash a big thumbs up and
subscribe to sample though maybe know
your opinions on this makeup look and if
you recreate this list and also please
let me know I felt like this was such a
long video because I just kept chatting
and chatting and chatting but overall
this makeup look I honestly could have
done in the barber space of 15 minutes
and I would say I'm going to be making
order products I actually use it down
below in the description box so you
