which to be completely honest it's kind
of what I just done roll out of bed
Tyler stop shove my hair up as you can
see I've got no makeup on right now and
this is this with me today I'm going to
be doing it the stripped-down challenge
if you don't know what it is basically
it's a challenge on YouTube and
basically you have to speak for ten
minutes without stopping
no cuts like no edits no color
correction completely natural so
everything in this video is going to be
completely natural as why I have no
makeup on right now and yeah I mean a
lot of people that know me will probably
think I'll suffer like this is going to
be easy for you because you can ramble
on and if you follow my vlogs you
probably will think that as well
actually I'm really nervous for this
video just because I've never done
anything like this on this channel
before I not have a little bit of my
vlogs but never just like I have to
challenge like this so I am a little bit
nervous and but yeah I just want to keep
it real on my channel and I want you
guys to kind of see another side to me
if you follow my blog then you will kind
of see the side to me more but on my
main towel I've never actually really
done anything like this and so it's a
challenge for myself and I can't wait
for you guys to and just see me ramble
um I guess yeah so I hope you guys enjoy
the video if you did please bash a like
and subscribe down below if you guys
haven't already and yet also I have a
vlogging channel that you guys can check
out and like see me more natural like
this right now but yeah so I need to set
okay I need to set a 10 minute timer on
my clock and then I guess we're just
going to go from there and see what this
video basically brings us okay so let's
set a 10 minute timer
okay ten minutes is about stop now I
don't know what you can see because the
lights color effecting but ten minutes
has literally just started and so let me
just put my phone down and then yeah we
can get started okay so for people that
don't know me or if you do know me my
name is saffron Barker my full name is
actually saffron autumn vodka and I am
16 years old basically seventeen I
consider myself to be seventeen because
every I feel like I don't know I feel I
can I act to the older and also my
friends were older I'm newly 17
basically so I like to consider myself
17 and so yeah that's why I consider
myself 17 but everywhere I go people
always assume and so much older than my
age which I used to find strange now I'm
just like so used to it I went to I was
looking at buy my first car the other
day and the man goes to me also I seem
that onto the 25 and I was like ha ah
whoa but obviously that's because I wear
makeup and stuff at that as well so now
I've got no makeup on I'm sure I look
very young my age it's not even younger
right now and yeah this is me I've been
doing YouTube for about and to say for a
year and a half now nearly 2 years which
actually excites me so so much YouTube
is actually one of the best things I
have ever done in my entire life like
it's brought so many amazing memories it
has so many opportunities because of
their I've met so many amazing people so
many amazing friends from it I have you
guys now which I never would have before
if it wasn't for YouTube and for that I
am so truly grateful for so YouTube
honestly for me has been the best thing
I have ever done in my entire life
however when I started YouTube I didn't
realize how many people had so much hate
with people that were reaching success
and for me I still find it strange now
because if somebody's doing well I'm so
happy for them like I feel proud if my
friends doing good I'm like I'm so proud
of them I'm happy like yes like you do
you you do what you want to do and if if
your reach and success from it is good
for you but some people don't feel like
that and I think that partly comes from
jealousy and obviously comes through
like other things as well and but that's
kind of one thing that I never really
noticed before I started YouTube and
obviously when started YouTube I've got
so much support hence why I kind of am
where I am right now it's all because of
you guys but also yeah I do get hate I a
lot of people write like on my videos
like why does saffron get so much Hey
and honestly I actually don't think I
get that much hate like I don't want to
compare myself to other people but if
I'm not comparing but the I don't
actually think I really get that much
shame like one or two other people's I
really don't think I do and obviously I
definitely do get hey and it isn't nice
but it's kind of one thing I just like
learn to ignore like giving them a reply
and stuff person's up to what they want
so I really can't be bothered to waste
my time doing that and but you guys want
to see the sweetest and even though like
there may be a thousand nice comments on
this channel
there could be one bad comment and
that's what affects somebody like no
matter who it is a thousand eyes comment
for that one bad comment will affect
somebody and at first it deployment
affect me as though oh like oh no it's
sad you know how somebody can write that
about you and it isn't the nicest
feeling as I've kind of grown on YouTube
and as I've been on YouTube longer I've
kind of just learned that slide and then
that person's always going to be wasting
their time doing that and you know I
mean that they want to do that go for it
and I know I have you guys so it doesn't
really make me upset but it definitely
does hurt people and the one thing I
will consider myself not to be is fake
and that is a word I get a lot a lot and
that is the only hate like hate comment
that you have it doesn't affect me
in a way and but it doesn't annoy me
because I wish these people could
understand who I am as a person
and the one thing I'll consider might
have not to be fake because for example
I saw my life every single day every
single life I saw my life I I show you
when I'm sad I show you when I'm happy
actually when I'm moody I tell you if I
just hasn't all grouped my brother I
tell you if my mum's annoying me I tell
you as much as I really can about myself
and for that reason I consider myself
not to be fake this is who I am I am Who
I am
I'm never going to pretend to be
somebody else because you know I believe
in what I believe in and I would say
what I think and I would do what I want
because that's who I am
and I have the right to do that and so
being fake is one thing that does annoy
me because it's like I'm really really
not this is exactly who I am and but
again it is something I just kind of
learn to ignore
go back to like nice comments and stuff
and I get a ton of nice comments which I
am so grateful for honestly to everybody
that's ever said a nice thing about me
thank you so much obviously it was the
biggest smile on my face but I
definitely still have insecurities and
that's one thing if I don't talk about
enough on my channel and I think the
reason being is because I try to tell
you as much as I can about myself but I
don't want to put it down or other
people's day and plus if I ever try and
say that I'm sad or anything I just get
called I'm attention-seeking when that
really wasn't my aim my aim was to let
you guys know that you're not alone and
but yeah I do have insecurities there's
some mornings when I wake up and I look
at myself in the mirror and I hate every
single thing about myself like every
single thing about myself and sometimes
I just I don't even want to get all of
the day but then I know I have YouTube
and I know I need to carry on and that
kind of lifts me up but I definitely
have insecurities for example I hate my
nose I've always hated my nose and now I
kind of just die
I have like a bump on the side of my
nose and now I just make a drink out of
it and even my friends do which I just
find funny like I call it like a glasses
seat now
because I have glasses and that's kind
of one thing I've learnt to live with as
one thing I always suffered with and I
know you guys and this is the thing you
guys I know a lot of you would think
there's nothing wrong with it but me for
myself I think there's something wrong
with it
so no matter what you say it won't make
me feel better
obviously it's so sweet and we does in a
way make me feel better but like it
won't change how I thought about myself
like all my life I've hated hating my
body and I think just because I hate the
fact that I can't have a slice of
chocolate cake without put in a way if I
have a pleasure talking I will put up on
constantly whether I have friends that
give whatever they want and I'm actually
I envy them so much they eat whatever
they want and they won't put away and
that's something I've always I've always
kind of always upset me and I've always
kind of had like an ongoing battle with
myself because I'll go to the gym I
think yeah yeah I want to lose weight
and then I like I eat chocolate cake and
I'll have a battle myself and so yeah I
do have insecurities about myself as
well but I don't feel like people see
and but again like there'll be another
morning when I wake up in the mind you
know what this is who I am and today I'm
going to love myself because this is who
I am and you get over the day and yeah
as I said I'm not talking like
attention-seeker anything I've always
have to explain myself
that's one thing as well I always have
to explain myself as well and because
like I just do like a thousand things
right and then I could do like say one
bad word do one tiny thing wrong in
somebody's eyes and they will hate me
for it and I'll get so judged for
everything and so that's like that's
something that comes with YouTube as
well and but actually right now I'm in
my happy estate I have so many amazing
people around me my family my friends
you guys genuinely mean everything to me
you guys make me happy and and so I'm
not trying to like just like murder
you think but and yes what were the
people that so like oh I have this
perfect life and stuff no I really don't
i'm literally an average teenager i am a
normal sixteen year old teenager that
films i live
there's no difference between you and i
asshole I'm just yeah I'm a normal
person and I think because some people
see me on the screen they're doing for
lifetime this real person that has
feelings and yes I do have feelings I
completely have feelings but yeah that
is kind of that I also recently for the
first time ever I actually suffered with
anxiety and now I'm not saying I have
anxiety and I'm not saying I have
depression but I did suffer with it for
a little bit and this is when I recently
watch it's not so recent now and a lot
of these guys may know that I had like a
really bad like breakup and it wasn't
quite a long time ago now I don't hate
anyone like I'm so over it honestly like
I know my happiest things right now as I
said because I have amazing people
around me and amazing people that use I
to support me and yeah I was I saying oh
my god what the same all the same oh yes
when this Skype kind of happened for the
first time I've always been like a
really confident person and oh my god
okay
my time is up I think people just carry
on this sentence I've always been like a
really confident person and then when it
happened for the first time ever I had
like I deny self a little bit anxious
and I know it like there'll be some
times when I didn't really wanna walk
out the house and stuff because they
just didn't feel myself and didn't
notice it was kind of weird because I've
never felt like that before and that
going to happen I try to explain to you
guys how I felt on my vlog my fake you
guys don't meet with you a lot of you
understood and but I always but people
would compare me to other people like
for example zoella gets anxiety or she
has a 90 and she's mentioned that a lot
of times like in their videos which is
so sad to anybody that has that honesty
Isis I can't explain how sad that is and
I don't obviously completely understand
because
never had it in the way that you feel it
but I'd have a little glimpse of it and
it's horrible and you know people will
compare me to other people as well and
just a judge before they actually know
like Who I am as a person and but yeah
when I try to explain that it it didn't
go well
everyone just was like oh my god you
don't have anxiety you don't know what
it's like and it's like I'm always
saying I have that I just I had it for
the first time it was horrible and that
was like one of the worst points in my
life like I've never felt like that
before but now it's good I've lifted
myself up I don't really talk too much
rather than the timer and my life I've
got amazing people around me I'm not
saying I've got a bad life I have a
great life I have great people I'm so
lucky for that and I honestly couldn't
be happier right now
and so thank you to all of you guys yeah
this is kind of the uncut version of me
there's no edits no color correction
nothing else I don't really know what I
rambled on in this but if you want if
there's something to get from this video
it's to definitely not judge others and
always be kind to others as well because
you never really know what somebody is
going through even if you feel like you
do like nobody really shows absolutely
everything so that's one thing I would
say but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed the
video anyways and hopefully I would see
you guys very soon on this channel
people are to like and subscribe down
below if you guys haven't already and
also I have a voguing channel as I said
that you can subscribe to as well and
yeah here's the uncut version of me and
I'd go enjoy a healthy brain soon bye
