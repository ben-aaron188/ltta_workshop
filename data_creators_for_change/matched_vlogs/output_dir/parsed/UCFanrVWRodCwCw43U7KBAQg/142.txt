to be testing out H&M makeup by applying
a full face to my face so every hope you

patient M goes I absolutely loved it as
a brand I shot that all the time however
I've never actually shopped for their
makeup I've never tried any of their
makeup items up before so I'm very
excited for this video so it's going to
be like my first impressions and I'm
just going to testing it out on my face
this video has been so highly requested
by you guys and in fact so hands just
testing items and makeup in general so
if there's a certain video and like this
that you want to see maybe testing
another makeup brand then let me know
down in the comments below and if you
guys enjoyed this and please smash a big
thumbs up and also subscribe it down
below if you guys haven't already and
without further ado I hope you guys
enjoy I am super excited for this video
so let's get into it I have so much
makeup here this is so flippin exciting
and by the way I don't actually have the
receipt on me so I'm going to leave the
prices somewhere on the screen for the
first thing that I do want to talk about
is how amazing the packaging is only one
took what this for too long just
dropping everything because I know it
can be kind of boring but the packaging
is literally so so nice for all of this
it looks very high-end this is actually
the only prime mother I saw in the store
that wasn't much variety and I don't
really tend to use mattifying primer I
beside Primal it's more moisturizing on
my skin but I'm sure this will be great
so I'm very excited to give it a go so
let's open this bad boy oh oh it's
pretty though I really like this is like
a matte black which is so nice I'm just
going to put a little bit on the back of
my hand
and then just rub it around my face or
actually in that's quite moisturizing
like you'll is kind of like creamy mmm
it feels quite creamy as well which is
quite nice so maybe it's going to rub
this
around my safe it already actually feels
a lot nicer than I was expecting it to
which is so so good I mean as far as
primers go I can't really you know I
can't really be the one to say oh it's
absolutely amazing because until I
actually apply a full face of makeup
I can't many say what this is like but
it sounds so actually quite nice on my
skin it's also quite moisturizing which
I wasn't really expecting it to however
it does feel kind of sticky but I guess
that means it's going to work now moving
over to foundation this is the all day
liquid foundation with a flawless finish
tightening it's going to last all day is
a very big claim so I'm really flipping
hoping this works again the packaging I
would say is absolutely amazing like it
kind of reminds me about this Chanel
packaging I know if you guys have ever
seen their foundations but it looks very
similar to this and overall which is
very simple just very pretty and this is
actually in the shade soft sand now I
haven't actually tested this shade on my
skin before so I'm going to ignore this
because I'm not the best when it comes
to picking shade so it could totally be
not my skin color but we just will make
it work so I'm just going to put a pump
on the back of the lid here and then I'm
going to go in with my Beauty Blender oh
yeah by the way I didn't actually pick
up hnm brushes I don't know why I did I
use a Beauty Blender a lot so just kind
of like should I should nice so that's
something you guys would want to see in
the future then also let me know down
below but I'm just going to go in with
this foundation and okay the colors
actually works quite well and I'm just
going to dab it in it with my Beauty
Blender
well the first thing I definitely want
to say is it blends and really really
nicely and also the shade I picked our
or goes up the add leaves are really
really nice shade and also works very
well for my skin this foundation I'm
loving because it's like a very creamy
moisturizing I've said this before that
I don't actually have like very dry skin
but I just like my skin to feel like
nice and moisturized and this is
definitely work and perfect for that
okay so now as you can see the
foundation is blended on my face
overall I actually read you like the
foundation and I definitely would use it
again as much as the foundation is
really nice and creamy where the primer
is so much like it it was a little bit a
dry on my skin which isn't like the
nicest feeling I can kind of feel it
like tightening up but I really
definitely would use the foundation
again it's really really good so now
we're going to go where the concealer
this is a concealer pen I've never used
something like this before oh this is
kind of cool though I've never actually
used a concealer like this before so I'm
very excited you just pump out the side
and then I believe it comes out white
it's not it will it will so I'm hoping
because it's quite like a matte finish
so far I'm really hoping this is a very
preemie concealer
oh okay quite a lot has come out on one
go since going to spread different size
okay so I'm going to apply it like a
triangle underneath my eye the buns have
made it really easy to apply though what
I'm really liking about it and it
definitely is creamy just how I want to
get to be so I'm really hoping this you
know makes them looks not so mastered at
some shade of it I'm not a massive fan
on I prefer if it was more like whitish
so I mean I do like it it feels nice for
my skin it's quite hard to blend like it
was why would it blend in that's really
strange so this isn't very blendable
because as you can see it's giving me
quite a hard time normally my concealer
doesn't take me this long to blend in I
really like the little bit and I really
like how it starts out on my face but
for some reason it just I don't know
it's given me such a hard time it's not
fun
in my face I think I'm just going to go
in with a brush and just hope for the
best because the Beautyblender is really
not doing it so I'm just going to go on
with this like foundation that's buffing
brush and just hopefully just try and
like buff it all out because it's really
not wanted to blend or my skin so it
definitely is working better with a
brush the words a Beauty Blender I don't
know why like I feel really sad right
now I expected this to be amazing but if
you can see close-up like it's gone so
dry almost I don't even have dry skin
and it's gone so dry on my skin I'm
really I don't know if it's the
concealer or instant primer okay after a
while we have got some where it's
blended away skin now it's pretty
average taking me about 15 minutes and
that's no exaggeration I don't really
know why it's because it just didn't
really work for my skin but now I'm
going to go in with the translucent
setting powder this is high definition
invisible powder now I'm going to get a
baker there from it she's just going to
like put my brush in it and just you
know just put it on my face so I put it
up on the lid I just got my powder brush
and I'm just going to brush it around my
face so I'm just going to put a little
bit on just to set my makeup that was
really really nice and the good thing
about it as well is I find it very hard
to find a powder that actually is
translucent because a lot of them say it
but you know they still kind of give you
that like whitish finish that you don't
want you want it to be completely
translucent you know and this one
definitely works like I cannot see the
powder and my skin feels a lot nicer now
so that's a good whole bronzer I've
actually got like a cream a bronzer now
this is actually what it is called this
is called the light and shade contour
duo this is defining and highlighting
creamy and blendable which is great
because as you guys know I like things
and I would creamy and a blend very
easily so I'm hoping this one work for
my skin now again the packaging is so
pretty thin a little compact
and what I love about it as well as the
fact that it has a mirror I love
compacts that have mirrors like it just
makes the palette so much better overall
so as you can see it has like a bunsen
shade then it has a highlighting shade
so I'm actually just going to use the
Brunton shade for now I think I did get
a separate highlighter only because I
don't like cream highlighters again that
they really don't work my skin however I
can actually use like cream contouring
palette and cream bronzers so I'm going
to have a go out with this bronzer here
so with this little brush here I'm just
going to give it do it Dublin across and
I'm going to put some on my cheek bone
always come out quite dark I think I've
got a little bit too far down my cheek
I'm going to put some on my jawline to
contour where I'm going to do the same
for the other cheek maybe not so much
that time I applied way too much I know
guys please like the most uneven lines
but by the time I blend it I should I
should look good now I like this cuz so
far this is very blendable which is
really nice and as it actually says like
on the front cover it is very creamy as
well which is also very nice so so far
I'm really liking this
honestly this bronzer is so beautiful
it's given me the perfect bronze and
it's blended so nice life's good as well
again is so creamy I'm going to do a
nice circular motions we just made it
quicker to blend but it is blending so
easily and I don't know it's definitely
contour my face very nice and also it
made this book look very highlighting
and glowy so I'm really feeling the
bronzer over I just really loved that
palette I just think it's such a pretty
palette I'm going to go in and blend it
on my forehead now this is the finished
look with the bronzer I am really
feeling actually as contour my skin is
so nicely and I definitely would use
that again guys I just realized I
completely forgot to tell you all but I
actually lost my blush now there was a
hole in my bag and I lost my blush and I
only realized when I came home in a
minute goes by yes I picked up the
prettiest blush and actually I forgot it
so it's the only thing I can't apply to
my face so I mean if you're just going
to put a little bit of my own blush just
to you know give that extra pop of color
so just amazing and our third test so
you can see like what it would look like
so this is just a two-faced blush I'm
just quickly applying a little bit on my
cheekbone now this is one of my favorite
items I bought and this is their
highlighter this honestly the packaging
I love so much again I'm really loving
the black and white theme with the gold
on it's like a very philosophy packaging
again and it is their highlight are in
the shade delicate pearl and it's so
pretty so literally one swipe of the
hand and look at my finger it's so
pigmented which is like the best if
something ever is more of like a pinky
kind of shimmery highlighter because
it's kind of got those is pinky
undertones which I think break-ins
really going to make my cheeks pop and
you guys know me what would you do well
you will know that I've slip in loved a
lot of highlighter I'm very critical
when it comes to a highlighter because I
have used some good highlighters over
time and I never really like using the
others but this is so stunning look at
that highlight
it oh my goodness it definitely used to
be rubbed in but it is like popping on
my skin right now and now then apply
some on my chip oh my Wow oh my
hallelujah this stuff is great that
needs to be loved too is so pigmented
just above my keep it's both a little
bit on my nose
I'm walking in the window and then I'm
sure PI teeny bit on my forehead
honestly I really really raid that
highlighter it's so nice like everything
about is the packaging the price I kind
of remember exactly how much it was but
it was so affordable definitely we'll be
using this again and it could even sneak
its way into my everyday makeup routine
as well
now it is probably made any book in
channel then you would know recently
that I actually got my eyebrows my
provided so I never really tend to fill
them in anymore so I'm going to go to
straighten with the eye shadow oh my
goodness the actual packaging over the
the eye shadow packaging is just so so
pretty
it really reminds me of the Kylie Jenner
and I should have had that she's brought
out recently and this is just that eye
color palette in the shade I think it's
like Oprah being a dream I I might be
wrong I don't really know but it is such
a pretty palette now I thought I would
go a little bit outside my comfort zone
oh you ever quit me about the packaging
it's so nice about the eyes and it's
very like Kylie Jenner aside so yeah the
palette that I picked up there was so
many different planets actually again
there was so much like with variety this
world like a purple toned palette but I
don't know I just thought I could make a
really pretty simple look with this
palette I don't know more of like a
burgundy kind of purple smokey eye I'm
all ready to go do too much because like
that's kind of like my weakest point
when it comes to makeup but I follow you
definitely make some like really pretty
look to this
I've never really seen colors like this
before either so this is why I actually
went towards this palette again it's so
nice it has the mirror in it as well so
I'm just going to apply some of this on
my eye
hi guys let me know the clothes are on
the screen right now so
I'm gonna fast Oh what color are we
going to go with first so I think I'm
going to kind of go with like this in
new - one here just for the base and
like I've got like a big kind of like
powder brush just to blend this in so
I'm going to put this on the base of my
eye all this come a lot darker than I
was expecting
it's come out of I was asking and I'm
expecting and I'm also going on with
this shade here which is more like a
ready kind of purple this is a very
pigmented palette I'm actually really
rating it so far I think I'm not going
to also have to go in this shop and pick
up the pinky palette as well because it
was anything like this palette I
definitely will be using it a lot so I
know this definitely won't be the most
amazing look you've ever seen in your
entire life but it is so simple and I
only use two colors for this look the
eyeshadow palette is amazing it's so
pigmented I definitely will be using it
again and I think I might have to go
into the store and get the other
palettes as well because they're so
affordable for the amount of shade I
think there was like 12 trays inside and
I really loved the look that I created
now going in with a mascara I
automatically fill in absalom SCARA
because I really liked the size of the
wand it looks really good I can tell
already it's going to be like a quite
condom Escarra
but that's fine I didn't actually pick
up any eyeliner but I'm just going to go
straight in with the mascara now I'm
actually really liking this mascara I'm
really liking the fact as well that you
get a lot of product on the brush
because that finds with like cheaper
mascaras the only problem is is you
don't really tend to get that much
product on the brush
however this one's actually working
really really well I feel like they
totally misjudged this mascara because
actually it's not as combi as I thought
it would be really actually spread out
my eyelashes and it was really really
well I really like this mascara I'm now
going to go in with eyelashes now there
wasn't much variety when it came to is
is and I'm more such a fan on the
eyelashes that I pitch but there's like
the best ones there right here it guys
I'm going to apply some eyelash glue
let me eyelash and just try and stick
these on camera right eyelashes on one
really good thing about the eyelashes is
the advantage of the eyelashes were
really thin and small that they were so
easy to stick on my eyes which is great
if you know good eyelashes try hating
them ones out because they're so easy
the band is so small certainly when of
my eyes really easily I really like now
I'm going to go with my final products
now I have got a lipstick and I've also
got a lip gloss now this is called in a
nutshell and it's a nude in the shade
oh 10 and this is the lipstick I'm going
to be using again the packaging Lister's
so flippin beautiful I love the gold so
much so when my maragon again I'm going
to be applying this on my lips oh the
shade I love this this is their and lip
gloss in the shade a velvet lip cream by
the way this is what I do know this is
not actually I want to think this is in
it but I think this is not something are
up like I don't really know I'm just
going to apply a little bit in the
middle of my lips and see but is matte
but this lipstick I would definitely be
using again it was so easy to apply
I love the shade again there was so much
when it came to lipstick there was a
massive variety like shades and stuff
and I just happen to pick out a really
nice one now I'm going to go in with
this velvet lip cream yeah I believe
this is matte so I'm just going to apply
a little bit to
Umbro my lips and apply a little bit in
the middle this is like a lighter kind
of shade again so pretty what so there
you go guys there's the end of my full
phase of only using hmmm makeup overall
I really rate this makeup the only thing
I drove right I would say is the
concealer and I think I'm partly going
to blame that on the primer as well
what's all of it kind of
to a bad start but towards the end we
kind of you know lifted off and ended up
being a really pretty makeup look I mean
I really like the way this looks and to
be fair my skin now applied like you
know the bronzer and stuff my skin
doesn't feel so dry anymore so it does
feel very nice and quite light on my
skin as well which is always good so
yeah this is the end result of using
