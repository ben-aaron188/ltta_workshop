hi everyone and welcome back to my
channel and our happy wherever the
delegate is I'm uploading this video
right now it's a Saturday for me but I
like so I was just like live on my
Instagram I've just been saying like how
lost I am with the days recently ever
since I've been traveling and stuff so
much I just don't even know what day it
is anymore
I hope I do know today's Saturday but it
feels like a Sunday but you probably
don't even care anyway
happy whatever the day of the week if
you're watching this video right now
today I actually pratik scientifical I'm
actually gonna be giving you guys a
drugstore haul now one of my favorite
places ever to shop which I know is
going to sound kind of crazy it's
actually super drug the reason being is
because it's one of those places where I
love love love my bra straps that and
totally needs to go they'll just wait
what what is it that is awful okay that
live awful organ so no you're just gonna
flip the hair like that okay okay
anyways is one of those cases where I
don't go in for a while and then every
two months or however I need so many
things from super drugs so I go for a
massive super drug splurge like it's one
of my favorite things to do because it's
all like the extensions I really really
really need and I've been holding on to
for quite a long time so every two
months or so when I go in there and get
everything that I need I walk out and
it's like such a relief and it's like
the best feeling ever
so that's basically what I'm going to be
showing you guys today obviously as well
this is like a drugstore haul so you
don't have to shop a super drug to get
these things like I know not everywhere
has a super charge we can get these
stuff from boots and like some other
drugs sold as well and I will try and
link everything down below for you guys
if I remember
please remember Sovran but yeah anyway I
hope you guys enjoy most likely be going
to subscribe down below if you guys
haven't already and let's get into the
video
I'm getting so off with the boring self
that you guys probably don't care about
that much but the first thing I always
think up some super drugs are face wipes
I always use faithful I want to use face
washes as well by always always have
since like these
the anivia face wipes of these are
three-in-one gentle cleansing wipes I
actually now I know a lot of people use
simple face wipes and I have used those
before and I do love simple as a brand
but for me and Lydia face wipes
definitely beat simple just because I
don't really know what it is but every
time I give simple face wipes it
normally like breaks out my skin so I
tend to use these ones as I a little bit
more like softer and as it says in the
name they're gentle on your skin let's
actually start with something I haven't
actually tried before this is one of
those things that YouTube definitely
made me buy and this is the Maybelline
new baby skin instant pore a resurface
is a lightweight
primer now I actually love Maybelline as
a brand and I love like their baby skin
what is the like they're like lip got
some stuff for a boy might as well give
the primer ago I've had some really
great things some of my favorite
youtubers have like raved about this
primer so I'm very very excited and I
also love a primer that's very
lightweight and I'm hoping it's quite
moisturizing as well oh it's more like a
gel okay so it doesn't look very
moisturizing but I will give you guys my
opinions over on my second channel but
yeah and super excited to try this out
oh and Gi flip in love this stuff this
is shampoo and conditioner this gives me
so excited I genuinely don't think any
other sharpening conditioner would get
me this excited and this is renewing
argan oil and Morocco oil this is the
best of ever if you guys are looking for
good hair treatment definitely go out
and get these now you can actually get
just the treatment separately to the
conditioner and shampoo but I just love
the conditioner and shampoo so much
whenever I use it my hair feels so much
better like so much healthier it's a
sticker just everything about it just
feels so much nice blending look so much
softer as well so I literally love this
stuff and I definitely would recommend
and really it's not very pricey as well
now I do go through it quite quickly
because I have super long hair at the
moment and so I do actually go through
it quite quickly but to be fair the
bottle is a pretty reasonable size so I
have to pick up some of these also
three like buzz today I need is cause
like I thought I feel like a look quite
summery I saw quite summaries so that
would be wise you guys definitely would
have heard me speak about this on my
vlog channel so many times I'm sure you
guys are not surprised
and this is the official Arcturus
bronzer and highlighter now I've
actually used the bronzer many many
times before I think I've actually used
it on this channel as well and I
literally love it
bonusing as well it smells like
chocolate which is amazing so cuz I love
this bronzer so much I thought I may as
well get the highlighter ago as it
actually comes in a duo palette so yeah
I fit this one up as well and again I
will give you guys my opinions and
thoughts over on my vlog channel every
single time and I literally mean that
every single time I go into Superdrug I
always get and I've got three of them is
the collection lasting perfection
concealer now the reason I bought three
of them is honestly because when I run
out it looks so heartbreaking
I've genuinely never loved to concealer
more than I love this save a cute
collection for this because this is
genuinely I couldn't do my makeup every
single day without this concealer it is
so so so nice I do it in the lightest
shade which is fair one I think they
only have three shades which is slightly
annoying I may be wrong on that don't
promise anything but yeah I see there is
only three shades which is quite
annoying but I mean I'm good because I
really like the fairest one I just love
it to highlight my skin honestly no
other concealer highlights my skin
better than this one and also it's very
full coverage however it's also
lightweight on my skin as well so
honestly everything about is concealer I
flip in love yeah that's where I have to
pick up sorry so to be fair hang on if I
fought like one concealer like in a
high-end it's going to cost again these
four of these so I feel like it's okay
for me to buy three I really needed a
clear gloss I haven't actually tried
this before but honestly finding a clear
gloss is actually pretty hard but I've
generally searched well I before I went
to superdrug a search online clear gloss
and
the only one I can find and then I went
into super jars and I asked them all
like you have any clean glasses and this
is the only one they had to show me so
this one's actually from Rimmel and it's
called almost gloss I mean not really
much to say about it I've never used it
but you can't really go wrong it's
literally just a click off dragon's
bladder fix pump in mask now this is
actually another new Z so I picked up
some super drug I'm elated by it in it
and fat I've really been trying to look
for really good skincare items because I
find my skin is kind of a cave but
recently I have been breaking out a
little bit more so I wanted to you know
make my skin as fast as I could or maybe
treat it a little bit better so I picked
up this face mask I've heard so many
great things about nip and fab and I've
never actually had the chance to try
them out so I'm really looking forward
to trying this out I can actually see
even though I haven't even opened it yet
I can smell it and it smells honestly
insane so it comes in this little tube
here and it's a hydrating face mask
which is really nice as well because
wherever there are so many holidays and
it's been so hot my skin has really been
drying out and my skin isn't really like
that like I would say how was normal-ish
skin I never really I never have oily
skin don't we have dry skin I'm kind of
in the middle I can't get this bit off
so oh oh oh come on our mouth
I was so bro okay that was not nice it's
kind of like a gel formula everything on
the top of skincare I have two other
items I never actually buy this much
skincare items but I really haven't been
feeling my skin recently so I thought I
really just go out there so I actually
got the simple kinds of skin hydrating a
light moisturizer and I have actually
used it before this is really really
good every time I use this my skin feels
so moisturized like so smooth so I love
using yet Webber again away if it's the
what's together sis or what I have used
before yeah and it smells so good as
well the only thing I would say about
this is if I don't know like it really
makes my skin really nice and smooth and
like hydrated
I find well thing is I'm beautiful okay
so this is so long I've used this before
but when I did use it before my skin was
at its worst it's ever been and I had so
many sports and sports wasn't really
going I don't really know whether to
bring it on this or not
I really don't think it is but it did
get to make me make my skin's all you
know smooth and moisturized so it's
definitely a win win on that and I'll
let you guys know because I don't really
know I think it was just at the time at
most p.m. which is breaking out whatever
I put on it I put so many treatments on
it and I really still want that to
happen again
hence why I've got so many different
treatments for most skin so I picked up
this moisturizer which is always good
and they also picked up another
moisturizer which was a little bit more
pricey but I've heard so many great
things about this brand I've never had
the opportunity to try it and this is
their 8 hour cream by Elizabeth Arden so
this is what it looks like and I think
it was around 19 pounds which for me I
do actually think is quite I mean it
isn't really but I don't really spend
that much on skincare so for me this is
kind of like a big deal but I thought I
might as well give it a go because again
I've had so many great things about this
and I just want to moisturize are the
work for me so hence why I've got a
couple to give a go hmmm it's also good
as well it smells like I don't know what
it's called
does anybody you all know what I'm what
about guarantee you can literally get
this from anywhere and I do have it
myself but I've completely forgot you
know like that like lip balm straight
lip gloss the comes on like a yellow
tube was like the red lid it smells
exactly like that
so if you guys not on what about please
let me know down in the comments below
so I don't sound really dumb
now I'm left with some makeup bits to
talk about I find this is way more
interesting so the first thing I
actually picked up is the Maybelline New
York of the four C's push-up drama
mascara now I have actually tried one so
ridiculously similar but it's like kind
of purple tube and it's generally one of
my clever on me my job it's actually one
of my favorite mascaras ever now so if I
can also find that that I will link that
down below but that's what I've been
using a lot recently but the most of
this one and this is their newest one so
I thought well I will
give this one a go just in case I wasn't
feeling this one I also picked up my
favorite mascara of all time and this is
the Maybelline volume express mascara
the cat eye mascara this is amazing
especially for like under eyes because
it's so thin the brush you can really
like I don't know just tell them money
made your I actually like clumpy and
stuff it's really really nice to like
spread out and it's a very easy mascara
to use basically if you guys haven't
noticed already I really think that
Maybelline wins with the mascara is that
one last thing what the heck okay the
last thing that I'm going to talk about
is the Rimmel London Sun shimmer
bronzing compact powder now I have used
this before it is really good it's
really not very pricey as well you can
actually get like a lot bigger pan of
this as well which I actually kind of
regret not buying but the reason I
actually bought this isn't actually for
my face I've actually got it for my
chest because this is one of those
things that's great for the body because
it has such a shimmer in it it's so nice
to just put all over your body and like
when your luck with patching a little
bit purely like myself and peeling here
from I don't know this is from Egypt
Sweden LA where I've been recently but
just suddenly really started peeling
here so I thought I always like users to
cover it up and it's just great yet
overall here if you just want a little
bit of a bronze but you don't really
want to like fake town in case it goes
wrong then this is actually really good
because it's like really shimmery and
pretty and it gives you like that bronze
kind of glow right put a lip of the
drink what so guys that is the end of
the video I find I definitely I don't
know I think I chatted quite a lot but I
had quite a lot to say about the
products I guess um I didn't maybe
that's why I was rambling on about
things God knows why I hope you guys
enjoyed this video anyway these are
doing on these are my favorite products
that I usually always pick up some super
drives like the concealer the shampoo
conditioner the bronzer or basically
pretty much everything I showed you is
what I always seem to get from Superdrug
