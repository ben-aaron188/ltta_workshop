tell you know people wonder people so
guys I am back with another hall again
don't be silly I have actually start the
floating ball that I thought is
accessible when it was the case because
that I'm closing hall and this is a maze
on pool so it is not cool and obviously
I have shopping so I mean I'm going to
do a hole once I've shot I mean calm
guys so recently I happy brought quite a
federal team a part that I am very very
very excited to try out most of it
exactly from Sephora I mean there are
some other products at all from Sephora
majority of it is as I did make a shoes
before order literally like I was
amazing so long whether to do it and I
tweeted out and users like you bitches
do it now unmissable out of it so
basically that is what I'm going to be
doing today throughout this video but as
I said there are some other bits of
artists before I just because these are
like some makeup products I just feel
like I need to talk about the code is
previously for a super super super I am
very excited to try our moment there's
quite a lot to go through sojourn around
the multitude on IndieGoGo so if you
smash a big thumbs up or this matter
like if you guys want to see more hauls
and also let me know down below if you
guys would see models as well but I'm
never going to I hope you guys are doing
under skin this video my big boss from
Sephora bursting so I'm actually going
to talk about is the anasazi are
certainly a liquid lipstick finally then
it was it said our most favorite thing I
would honestly preserve up to top there
the best favorite liquid lipsticks of
all time records they're so easy to
apply and as well and all the colors are
literally husband so physically I have
actually tried before so when I ordered
this and universally loved it and this
be in the color strip it is the most
gorgeous nude ever
it's a canoes it has like a light pink
undertone and I think it's so pretty I
asked the another packaging with the ads
quality of ebony a little bit as well
overall like when it when it sticks just
they do so much justice make about my
hands are here again I put the modern
renascence palette now this I've
actually had so many good things about
this color is really really pretty roses
are on YouTube and honestly it's such a
gorgeous palette I never knew that it
was actually suede on the front which as
a mouth and just think it makes it a
little bit different every other eye
shadow can its I own the inside which is
obviously the best part every single
shade in here is so beautiful and I want
to be seen even though there's quite a
variety
I would genuinely use every single one
because for me I'm not using like on my
everyday make that will clean either
like news or gloves indeed red or orange
tone colors and that's pretty much what
this planet consists of so I'm super
excited to like try them all out now
that's my feedback on change and these
primavera
as soon as how you pronounce it I try to
over those shades together before the
pigment in them are absolutely like
outstanding so and this item to try the
rice and yeah I'm sure this is down that
they become part of my everyday makeup
routine next notice is I want to talk
about is actually fade love now I've
actually used to be playful by Sephora
before or haven't actually used like
these people so these are different
scents that do kind of different things
since no one here is great for pressing
and fighting the skin and then I'll be
one here is great for paranoia and
detoxing your cool and for detoxing your
skin so exuberant why do I keep doing
that I'm super excited at red roses news
now I'm sure you see me on my dens on
try and leaves out I mean a totally
different like sheet masks before and a
lot of them don't stick to your face but
the reason I actually like those ones
and a nice keyboard is more is because
they're really great sitting on your
face and they're really
portable as well they're $6 which is
like three powerful passing see Laura
Murphy our new setting powder again I've
heard so many and native things about
this on YouTube this is like social
roots as a whole it's like not just on
YouTube in life in general this is
supposed to be insane and I know this
kind of commonplace
I actually have never want to see use a
second powder on my face before I just
so use one of my everyday makeup routine
but I thought why do I need to because
every time I do like my everyday makeup
routine videos whoever you both always
saying to me that one why don't you use
setting powder so I picked up this one
which was ridiculous expensive like
little solar pricey
honestly I've really treated myself as
this one so I'm really really hoping it
was guys pray for me
pretty neat envelope or just let me know
if you do use them and if you have used
it and what you think of it I mean I
have heard so many amazing things about
it so I just thought I'd splurge out and
just just give it a go from Sephora also
ask you've got the toothpaste little
glance now I've actually never advocate
to glue again before I just never really
needed it before
originally I actually ordered some
really pretty glitters that I've got to
talk about throughout this video and but
I'll talk about it now I will different
kind of like enamel and they stop when I
go out that's a bit more dramatic so
little bit more different you know
people have to go oh my god sample of
skin from you know and a one little bit
more Sparkle so I ordered those
different letters and I need to submit
the glue and my friend has Calvin and
Anastasia here on YouTube they actually
display and they say it's really good so
I'm saving that word for the quizzes
that I was talking about they actually
got to go with the good
obviously I need eclipses to go with it
this is another thing I definitely
treated myself do so I actually got the
ACE like crystallized
glitters she's also quite easy i
exceeded their where your private
however I still bought them because I do
want to see the
they are amazing and yeah I mean they
just give you that extra something now I
find my friends Justin and Anastasia
stand for and suspect I tried them out I
was like I need that in my life so I
ordered sorted for shame I've got angels
tips which is the one I've actually
tried a sense before which is a
beautiful God's gift up I got two of
those and what darkstar and I asked me
cause my my heart was ten Queenie which
again actually ruin others gorgeous
split up it's pretty much like anal tips
that the particles are like a lot
smaller took a lot more glitter and
gives you a bit more was the last look
yeah they're really pretty really
overpriced though I like type of thing
as well which looks me like another $20
one pop so yeah really splurged out
there really treated myself but it is
what every really nice when I just like
premium stuff you just look a little bit
more different and we want it nice and
then I'm in a little bit of sparkle and
run in my life so yeah I think something
next thing I got was the quite a lot you
forgot I got buff super happy dive I did
get into another Anasazi a liquid
lipstick again the exactly interchange
Dulce and it is such a gorgeous pink now
for me I find it really hard to find
like pings honestly the hardest
lipsticks in fire I don't know what it
is but I'm really funny about my thing
for me it is like a nice light bright
pink like that how I would describe it
and once we have cocktails or my
teachers and my overall I just think
it's such a pretty color and I know I'll
get a lot of youth element definitely
more in the summer as well like I feel
it is like a various holiday by dollar
speeches how can the local pretty random
without one lipstick also makes me think
about it sexy you know
another victory if you must Jacob
remarkable foundation I really wanted to
try itself because again it raised about
all over YouTube and I honestly
the packaging Asilomar my first thought
on this foundation was the packaging is
so pretty like a coke simple but it's so
pretty I tried it today on my skin and
so far and absolutely loving it because
it's very very full coverage which I
know I only have everywhere like full
coverage foundations every single day I
nobody feel like I need it every single
day but you know what I want to go out
like on a dressing night out all of the
goal night out and whatever and I know
if I want to go out like in the evening
and dress up a bit more then it's the
foundation that I think they definitely
would reach to yeah I mean I use the
tiniest bit alive skin this morning and
so far it's offered me all day I really
like I don't know I really kind of
hoping that I don't like this foundation
so I can go back to my old brands which
originally use which is like half the
price so I'm kind of hoping to a joke
idea but so far I'm absolutely loving it
however one last thing I will say about
it I put in the shade 14 ivory medium
it's a lot lighter than the normal
foundation that I use on my skin but I
mean I caught on a bronzer and I saw
like I thought okay lipstick a right now
so let me know down below what you guys
think makeup off your face again I
actually got this Too Faced Born This
Way concealer not really much to say and
I mean it's a concealer I got it in the
shade light again it has so many great
things about it however you don't have a
read this problem trying to choose the
right shade on the website all the
things really hard to see online I
actually got the shade light
I thought I could definitely do with
like a lighter shade on it there were
three shades lighter but they have my
pinky tone in it and my fingers that
really do well my pinky toned and
debates in it if you bettors like yellow
times and
what the life is yellow cones one that
they've done and I feel like it's not
light enough but I mean I'll give it a
go and yeah I'll let you guys know my
thoughts on that overall my second
channel the final balloon from Sephora
is the Kat Von D tattoo liner again has
so many great things about it these look
like you sure you can get in the UK many
example if you can but I wasn't making a
massive order of Sephora I just sort of
picked it up as well so I thought the
cap on be higher because it's meant to
really last well and that's what I find
with eyeliners even though the one is
probably using it is absolutely amazing
it doesn't because of we've not
something than three hours but it fades
really quickly but the breaking
resistance is meant to last really well
so I've got the jet black color and
really hoping it does seem legit so that
was everything from Sephora we are now
going to want to sub it but I got and
it's got most of these like a couple of
weeks back and it's trying not to use
but not so I prepared for this video so
the both BMG tartan green palette which
hasn't really sucked my world fire
because they use it once and then I
ended up using it every single day since
and it's just become a part of my
everyday makeup routine now this color
the size is going to say I actually love
the packaging I just think it is so so
stunning
inside though is even better there's
actually 12 different shades in here I
think this was thirty-six pounds as we
got my from Amazon Prime I mean I have
amuse me every single day because all
the shadows in here are just very
neutral shadows as I said I love using
news and like Fergie shades so as all of
that in here all pretty neutral and then
it also has like dot black and light
dark brown and birds new shades as well
so kind of comfortable and everything
but a bit of everything from every daily
routine and I pretty much tried
everything for saving here they are so
pigmented the pigmentation in this
planet is absolutely unreal like
honestly I swear by this planet now
next up Carmack I actually got these
present prime v + R a now I actually got
sent this by Max so it's only so much
that I wanna see so so grateful as IV
amazing drivers again I mean I have a
get to try out for and I've never really
used anything like this before so I mean
something extra add to my collection and
I am actually really intrigued to try it
out let me know down below if you guys
use it or if you have uses the floor I'm
just thoughts on it and maybe as well
jazz alert like what sways you think
best to apply it because I really want
to go up observers dead like I've never
actually used anything much and with
these final things I'm going to talk
about our falsies now I am in love one
brand courses at the moment life are
pretty much worth every single day
because I just think it made all the
difference in the world but these are
actually got sent five some eyelashes
that : UK which again I'm so grateful
for the safety so marked and these ones
are a little bit more extravagant future
weren't really wear like on every daily
like day to day basis
these are more like a night out like
going up to friends with in the evening
like dressing up more but these are just
football apps if you studies I wanna
commend to me throughout the video sees
that I can provide these brand health of
lashes which have never tried before but
has so many good things about and the
reason actually picked these two out
within bourgeois and iconic is just
because too many verses look very like
wispy which I think the greatest good
pair of eyelashes and not the eyelashes
and even though they are very still and
very heavy looking I think maybe this
very lightly at the same time and I
asked us to need that still light and
that you probably feel are the best buy
it because there's nothing rather than
wearing my next is that you can just
still and like annoy your eyes and
irritate your eyes
so these ones I mean they must
amazing and I do have to mention them
and again and for my second channel I
will let you guys know I actually think
of these local minutes I've actually got
a premiere tomorrow so I'm going to be
wearing either one of these pairs so you
will probably have seen over all my days
on the channel when I think of these
that you have different sizes I mean
they look absolutely stunning what you
know most guys they really hope you all
enjoyed the video I mean I absolutely
not dominus video because honestly I
love talking about my socks so bad and
now I've spoken about it I can use it
all which is even more exciting so I'm
so excited to try the bit style I
haven't tried that before and they give
you guys my opinion from stuff like that
I'm just so in love with honestly
everything I bought and and certified
just give it a go and I'm so excited to
go to bed because it's so light also
solid it is like practically 12 cm right
now so I'm going to go to bed and you
already make up in the morning and it's
going to be like the best thing ever
