happy Christmas every one of you guys
having the best thing Christmas yet I
have had an awesome Christmas so far
even though it's only like 12 or
something I feel with this video even
though it's Christmas Day because I
wanted to get it up on Christmas Day for
you guys to watch so you kind of feel
like you're part of me opening my
presents and you're part of my Christmas
as well if that makes any sense stood
over it really does just wanted to
upload this video today because why not
so today I'm going to be telling you
guys what I actually got for Christmas
2016 now that I have actually missed out
little bits like stocking fillers and
like little bit saw one of my snaps and
stuff I kind of like missed some of
those out but like the main presents
that I got I'm actually going to be
showing you today and by the way guys
disclaimer I wanted to see so going full
of everything that I got and so lucky
I was so spoiled this year and I was not
expecting to get half the things that I
got so that's a little disclaimer for
you guys but without further ado let's
get into the video so the first thing I
want to show you guys that I got which
I'm so excited about and I'm showing you
guys is first because if you guys follow
my daily vlogging channel I've been
doing vlogmas this year and there was
this one present and I was really trying
my hardest to guess what it was because
my brother and I both had the same
present and we've both been someone
decided on what it was and I thought it
was going to be a record player
Mary Chris man why you gotta say look
out for the vlog yeah yeah she is so
cute
so I thought it was going to be a record
player because we both had the same
present but it wasn't and is actually
something even more exciting because I'm
actually currently moving rooms again if
you follow my daily vlogging channel you
would know that and I wanted to have a
bit more color to my room so the first
thing I actually got is this picture
here it's a huge Chanel picture and it
has like dome aunties all over it and
it's really colorful and I absolutely
love it and I cannot wait for it to go
in my new bedroom which I'm so excited
for I saw this in a shop with my mum
about six months ago and kind of forgot
that I even wanted it because I wasn't
then gonna end up changing rooms but now
I am and I'm so grateful that I got this
one cause it's so thoughtful and
secondly
cuz yeah I really wanted this many
bedroom and this will definitely be in
my new backdrop of my videos when I
moved to my new room so make sure you
guys in the cut for that cuz you're
gonna see this in it and then also
whilst I'm showing you that one I also
actually got another one really similar
I'm not really sure which one I prefer I
achieve a further one I just showed you
my mumble as this one and it that both
so call again has so much color to it
look and like the Louboutin lips I just
think yeah it's so cool and I cannot
have yourself in my bedroom I'm so
excited just to have like a bit more
color like I love my room so much right
now I want more of like a colorful
backdrop for YouTube and the swarthy and
these are gonna make a great touch for
it so that I actually got for my mom and
my dad yeah and I'm so so happy about so
the next thing I'm going to talk about
was like my main main present and this
is actually a holiday so I got this it's
actually quite a funny story because we
all opened it separately and when I
opened it up I opened it up first and I
was saying oh and mum was like don't say
anything it told the boys open there so
I was like okay and then the second I
saw them open theirs we all just
screamed and it's on my vlogging channel
again oh but yeah so we actually got 11
nights in an all-inclusive hotel in
Egypt in March and I'm so excited I
cannot wait to go like I love going on
holiday and yeah I'm just so so excited
and before I opened this as well my next
present which I'm about to show you
which again I'm so grateful for I
actually got this carry-on by Ted Baker
which I thought was absolutely beautiful
and I keep saying to my mum next year I
really want to go traveling like the
stony places I would love to go so it
kind of thought it was for that reason
but I'm guessing like she thought you
know for Egypt I can take away this
suitcase so this carry-on suitcase is
from Ted Baker it's so pretty I love it
so much it's great but like all the
little flowers on the bottom as well it
has like these copper wheels which are
absolutely love and then on top as well
oh my goodness I am in love with the
handle the handle so pretty I love how
it's like all copper is amazing I'm
I was a happy that I got it one thing
that I can't work it out so it's
actually like a lock and you have to
enter the code to unlock it I have no
idea how to unlock it because it's
already got a code and it doesn't tell
you what the code is so and you could
probably go on the website or ring them
off and ask about that or if you guys
have a Ted Baker suitcase or a Ted Baker
like carry on like this and please let
me know because we have been trying all
morning to unlock it and I just have no
idea so the next thing that I got you
would have seen in my Christmas wish
list and this was this light-up mirror
I'm going to take this off so I was
saying to you guys ah look you can see
my reflection I was saying to you guys
how badly I want this light-up mirror
you just like put your finger on it and
it lights up and I just think it's the
perfect size to your makeup and I'm so
excited to use this to do my makeup in
the morning like it's going to be so so
helpful and yet this was something that
I honestly really really really wanted
and I honestly didn't even think I would
get this I just kind of thought that my
mom would forget and it's quite hard to
find on the Internet as well but yeah
I'm so happy that I got this this
actually came in my sack from Santos so
yeah I'm really really happy that I got
that so I got the light-up mirror but
let's move on by the way guys I don't
really want to like talk about it for
too long just because I don't really
feel like it's needed I'm just gonna
like go through like the presents I
absolutely love so the next thing I got
was this little beanie and it is from
H&M I love this beanie is so funny cuz
in the morning I put it on Jordan and he
looks so funny with it I would put it on
now but I feel like I can't move ruin
the Christmas vibe and not wear my son
to hat and yeah I got this little bobble
beanie and I got this in my sack this
year which I love love love love the
color
and then also from my best friend
Georgia she actually got me so many
things like little things she got me so
many but I'm only gonna show you two of
the things that she got me so she got me
this knit personalized cinema box which
I thought was so so thoughtful because I
think it would be so nice in the back of
my videos again and in my new bedroom
and I've actually always wanted one so
I'm really really excited to use that so
thank you so much Georgia for that and
then also Georgia which is
literally made me have tears in my eyes
so I actually got this memory jar inside
it has so many different photos of
Georgia and I like throughout the years
Georgia's been my best friend for like
so many years now and I just thought it
was so so thoughtful to get like the
pictures printed out and to cut them out
put them in the jar they just put like
chocolates and stuff inside as well and
I just thought is a really really nice
and thoughtful present and yeah like it
made me super super happy when I opened
this so thank you so much Georgia she
did get me like tons of other things as
well but we'll be here forever if I
showed you literally everything actually
got this really really nice bodysuit
which I love I love it so much I love
the factors off the shoulder I love the
fact that it's red for Christmas and I'm
probably gonna wear this today and
because it's like quite dressy even
though last year though I don't know if
you followed my vlogging channel last
year but I actually got something so
similar like in a burgundy color and I
wore that on Christmas Day I feel like
I'm gonna be wearing the same thing
again but it's not so cool so yeah I
think I might wear this today I got this
from Baroque art it's really stretchy
and I love the material
and it's a bodysuit I'm really into body
suits at the moment so I think this is
what I'm going to wear today which does
remind me currently I'm wearing this
stagg top which is by Justin I feel like
yeah I'm trying to show you it's the
purpose tour March also got this for my
mum and dad so thank you so much again I
have been wanting this for such a long
time and I'm so happy that I got this
I'm wearing it right now but I don't
want to wear it all day actually got
makeup here and I thought maybe I could
get away of it in the video or maybe I
can't I just told you all now so
probably can moving on love this top
anyway so I also got this for my mom and
my dad then the next thing I got this is
one of the things that my best friend
Libby got me and this is so so cute so
Allah begot me these the yes pajamas
which are so pretty I love the fact that
it's a vest as well because even though
I do love wearing onesies and stuff I
get really hot in the night and I hate
it and really really hot in the night so
this I thought was so nice and of course
we all know that I absolutely love
Victoria's Secret so that was one of the
presents that Libby got me so thank you
so much for that also comes the sleeping
mass another thing I got to show you oh
yeah this is from Georgia again this is
this beautiful choker which I think I
would definitely wear today I am
obsessed with chokers and it's like gold
I Monte's around it and it's so pretty
so it also got that from Georgia and I
still yet have to open presents from my
auntie's and my uncles and like other
family members my nan and my granddad
but yeah like that was everything I
actually got oh no no that wasn't
everything I got oh my god what my
favorite present yeah it's because it's
not next to me oh no it is next to me
okay
how did I miss this out I have no idea
so the final thing that I actually got
from a Tiffany and Co now I'm so happy I
don't even know how I forgot that I
would have freaked out if I finished the
video don't remember this my mum and dad
got me these Tiffany and Co earrings I
have been wanting them forever they're
the little silver love hot ones that
just have tip knee and co on them I'm
going to show you but they are so tiny I
don't even think you will see on camera
but I have honestly been wanting these
for ages I know that I would wear them
every day and like and never take them
out they are so pretty and I'm so
grateful for it
how do I forget that no way so yeah I
also got I'm trying to put it back in
the little bag wait come in I don't want
to lose these imagine losing these oh I
think I cry my eyes out but yeah I also
got these Tiffany and Co earrings do not
want to forget about those I probably
forgot about something else oh I just
