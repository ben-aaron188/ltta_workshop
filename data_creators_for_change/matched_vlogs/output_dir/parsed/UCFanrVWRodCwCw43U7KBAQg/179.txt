channel so today I'm gonna be talking
and chatting through my favorite things
I've actually bought this December and I
really hope this video does help you

that i've actually got is under 20
pounds so it's super affordable and a
great gift ideas and also great stocking
ideas as well i would love to receive
everything that i'm gonna be showing you
guys today so hopefully you guys will
too
and hopefully this will help you out if
you're buying for your friends family
girlfriends boyfriends etc I think I've
got something for everybody in the
family so hopefully this video does help
you guys out if it does please slash a
big thumbs up subscribe down below if
you guys haven't already and without
further ado let's get into this video so
the first thing I picked up it's more of
a stocking filler rather than just a
present alone this was six pounds I got
this from Topshop and this is festive
selfie photo props
I think this overall is just a great
family present I think everybody no
matter how old or how young you are or
love this I'm gonna have so much fun
with this I think this is just great
around the table on Christmas Day I
think this is just so much fun in
December I love to take photos like have
photo shoots my friends and staff and I
feel like this has just brings so much
better fun so yeah this is six pounds I
definitely think it's worth the money as
you can take some really awesome and fun
funny photos with this and they make
great memories as well so I think this
is just a great stocking filler and
could be great for anybody any age
secondly you don't want to talk about
this for too long as it's very similar
again just another thing you can have
with all your family no matter what age
you are
I think this are hilarious I just need
to fit it around my nose okay wait then
I change as you move so I'm not really
sure which one is on right now these are
just the 3d motion face coasters I think
these are just really off rip my nose
ring out I think these are just
brilliant because they can make
everybody laugh there's so many
different mouths on these and four
pounds such a bargain does that look
good does that leg good is my head too
small did you say these are funny get
the four pounds Matalin I got these from
and I saw another shop that had them as
well so you can get them from pretty
much anywhere really easy to get hold of
Intermezzo next up I got this from new
look this was $12.99 and I think it
looks a lot more expensive than it is
this is just a light-up
chalkboard I just need the lights around
it looks so pretty and I think the great
thing with this is if you're very
forgetful like myself then is a great
way to remind yourself and also looks
very pretty either in your bedroom or
your kitchen or whatever in your house
also anything this is one of those
things that you wouldn't really go and
buy yourself so I think it's a really
nice thing to give somebody else and if
you're I don't know feeling down that
Dale whereas I think writing a positive
message on this it's just a nice way of
used to walk into your bedroom or your
kitchen or your lounge or wherever if
you walk into a nice positive message on
this I just think it will matter no I
think it'll make me smile I just think
it's just yeah overall a really nice
cute ornament and 1299 super affordable
a brilliant gift this was 15 pounds I
also got some Topshop I think this is a
great gift for a boy or a girl
even though I would actually probably
give this to my brother as he loves
candy and he loves watching American
candy videos I think this is great just
because I think you're getting so much
more than 15 pounds in here like I've
used to buy these sweets alone
especially of you in the UK it's a lot
more expensive just because this is a
really UK candy it's real American so
you have to go to like American candy
stores where they sell it for a lot more
expensive so I think in here 15 pounds
will get in a lot more than really
you're paying for and I just think it's
a really nice gift even though it's food
I just think it's so nice like all in
one box
so yeah this looks delicious I wouldn't
eat it myself but I'm not going to
because I'm thinking of actually giving
this me younger brother for Christmas
because I have no idea what to get him
and I just think this is a great gift
idea again I think it looks more than 15
pounds so yeah these cameras I think are
adorable
I feel like I've mentioned how momma's a
lot in my recent past videos recent past
videos in my recent videos but I am
obsessed with how momma's I just think
they are great on the go if you guys are
still going to school or you have
towards a college whatever
then if you're feeling cold how mamas
are amazing because they just warm you
up that's so easy and they're so tiny as
well and especially when you get cute
ones like this
I mean how can you not want to take them
out yeah really affordable again and
looks pretty cute great your stocking I
would love to receive this for Christmas
so if you guys I don't know if you want
to buy for yourself or if you have a
friend that's brave similar to myself
then yeah pick up one of these
especially if you guys fill the cold
easily then yeah grab some of these
because one they're cute and secondly
they do the job this room spray my
friend Roxy actually got me as an early
Christmas present because I saw her and
I fell in love with that and I was like
I need that in my life so she got me
this is the present and I just had to
mention it because it is the most
amazing smell if you guys love baking or
if you just have a really sweet like if
you're on lover for sweet sense you are
going to be obsessed with this so it's a
Bahama London it just cookies room spray
its aren't that believable I love the
glass packaging as well it's so simple
but I just think I just I don't know I
think it looks so cute
and this was six pounds I believe from
TK Maxx this literally I know it's
called just cookies but it just smells
like cookies like it smells like one
spray of this by the way it is so strong
it could make the whole kitchen smell
like you've been baking all day it is
incredible and you need this during
Christmas time so if you guys can pick
this up from TK Maxx I definitely
recommend you guys to because it's the
best scent ever also again really great
for pretty much anybody like I know my
nan my mom my I don't even have a sister
but if I had a sister my sister would
love it too your auntie you've somebody
else your somebody else and you're
somebody else your best friend your
cousin don't really know who else to say
no but anybody I feel like anybody can
do with this again six pounds you get so
much in here how many milliliters is
there I have no idea oh no it doesn't
say but you get a lot in here and one
spray will last a couple of hours at
least it's so strong and smells
good I feel like a Ramadan about this
but it's the bomb I can actually that is
the best now oh my god I love it I love
it when my face is filling smooth and
I've just had like a pan the evening
like it's just a lovely way to treat
yourself so I'm here top these face
masks I got them from Topshop they were
three pounds which is such a bargain so
a great stocking filler also if you guys
to do an X Secret Santa and you're
looking for a gift under five pounds
three pounds like it's it's brilliant
I mean firstly they look adorable I'm
loving the pan too one so much but then
I love this one too but perhaps to
choose it's gonna be the party one if
you if you got a moment I'll think okay
if you have a friend that suffers with
like black cats if you don't want to be
like in a rude way and you wouldn't be
nice and safe here you go these face
masks are great because they're three
pounds they're really good at getting
rid of blackheads and like putting them
around your nose also I think because
they're because it's like a charcoal
face mask it looks really funny as well
so if you and your friend want to have
like a pamper like a night routine then
I just think these are great as well
great stocking filler and they're really
cute next gift idea is this Merry
Christmas set and it's by the body shop
and I firstly again think it looks super
cute it's really cute the packaging I
love how it has all the lips over it and
I just think you're so cute or is shaped
like a little lollipop and then inside
it has five different lip balms I love I
think at December time not even December
I just like overall throughout winter so
January February cetera why my name in
the month don't really know but
throughout winter I really tend to get
cracked lips and I felt like this is
something that everybody can relate to
during the winter time and say that but
really it's like an all year-round thing
because everybody loves the lip balm if
you're going on holiday or somewhere as
well but yeah lip balm everybody loves
having your lips feeling nice not
cracked dry lips so this Merry Christmas
sir I think it's great ten pounds so
each lip balm is costing you two pounds
of working it out Thea
just feels great because it has five
different flavors strawberry is that
cherry grape I don't know what that one
is orange I think it's orange it looks
really cute as well again really
affordable and I think it's a really
lovely gift don't even think it used to
go in a stock in if I was just gonna
give this to my friend I think that'd be
really great for as I just think it's a
really nice gift powerfully for me I
would rather receive something that has
more meaning so this I think is a
present with a lot of meaning and this
all $6.99 so not too much but this has
so much thought that can go into it and
you can really make it really personal
to basically it's a scrapbook at the
moment obviously I've put nothing inside
a bit but it's just a plain scrapbook
but within this scrapbook or actually at
the front it says remember this and I
think it's really cute I'm really pretty
a little little gold stars around on the
front cover but inside you get like
stickers and stuff something to say
besties so if you is to give this your
friend if you so maybe like stick it I
don't know if you have a Polaroid and
you want to put in some my polaroid
pictures just stick them in and then I
don't know have this little sticker this
has besties an area I just think you can
make this scrapbook so pretty and you
can make it so original like make it
your own and it has so much thought that
goes into it it has so many awesome
stickers like my squad throwbackthursday
boots or things are really really cool
sticker actually definitely will be
using this one doesn't even have to be
just for your best friend can also be
for your boyfriend or even for your
girlfriend and for anybody your mom your
granddad your dad so I think it's very
personal and obviously it would be a
lovely gift to give to somebody I would
love to receive this myself as there's
so much thought that goes into it
and obviously you don't even just have
to put photos you can maybe just like I
don't know write your favorite memories
in there and it could be like a
scrapbook over the past year like when
you first met each other or just even
like throughout your lifetime but like
you don't even have to do this yourself
I think what is great as it comes like
in a whole set there's a lot of things
to do in here you could just give this
as a present and they could do it
themselves to put their own memories in
there with everybody not just you and
that person if we're not that close so
yeah I think it's a great gift and it
can have a lot of thought I meaning into
it next I have this trio set if you guys
are a makeup
or a lipstick lover this has three
different colors it has a curved red
anymore nudie purp Andy toned color and
then a lovely light pink and I think
this is great because all the colors are
very different to each other and I
actually really love the NYX matte
lipsticks and my favorite lipsticks out
of all of their lipsticks that they
actually do I can't exactly remember the
points of this but everything is gonna
be linked down below this is something I
would personally love to receive because
we all know I have an obsession with
unicorns and I have an obsession with
buying cups like I don't even like tea
or coffee but I love why myself a good
mug so there you go so I picked up this
unicorn mug which is super cute it is so
pricey for what it is it's 16 pounds but
if you're obsessive unicorns it's gonna
be worth the money
see I goes from Urban Outfitters this is
what it looks like such a shame that
it's not the colorful unicorn that is
actually on the box so I don't really
know how they're allowed to do that it
says color-changing yeah guys I just
realized it says color-changing I was
just about to complain to you guys
saying it's such a shame it's not the
colourful one on the front but it says
color-changing so I think when you put
hot water if you've got the kettle
it might oh it's so not gonna do
anything no is it maybe it takes time
okay right is it it's not actually
boiling though is it
yeah it's not very hot though I don't
think it is changing oh my good it is
changing it's going at pinkie but this
isn't boiling point and water
avocado okay this is also my food this
is worth the money definitely what I
should make the color change in a bit
bigger because look how small it is on
the box is that literally tiny
color-changing and then people open it
up and think oh it's purple it's mostly
colorful take two we are putting boiling
water in now please don't spit up over
my fingers oh my god that's awesome look
okay that is actually brilliant Wow
I want to get one of these for all of my
friends
apart from the fact that the hot water
is like splashing over my finger okay
that is amazing that is actually amazing
I'm actually like blown away the final
gift that I've got is it was nine and
ninety nine this was from a new look
again this is a gift that could be very
personal but it doesn't have to be if
you don't want it to be it's a little
photo frame with little PEZ and then it
has different pictures inside so you can
really give this for anybody your
boyfriend/girlfriend friend mom you know
anybody I'm actually gonna give this to
a gift for my friend and I've got some
of the in Sepik pictures from my
Polaroid and I'm gonna put someone in
here just to make it a bit more personal
but again as I said you can keep these
pictures that they already have or if
you want to make you more Christmassy
like more Christmas if I'd then you can
just like print off some squirrel or
pictures some Christmas related pictures
put them in here and then they can maybe
change it up every season hang this up
on their wall so yeah I just think it's
a really lovely gift it can be personal
if you want it to be but doesn't have to
be and it's 999 what slow was I really
