hi guys I'm Harbor back to my channel so
for today's video today is about to
school video it is actually like a tips
and a half to score so I'm really
excited about it and I'm really happy as
well because this video is kindly
sponsored by staples yeah makes you say
in 2 p.m. because I've actually got like
a really or can give away with them or I
get into this video I just want to say
whether it's a new school that you've
just started or a new college or you're
just going back for another year at
school or guide don't be nervous don't
overthink things
everybody's in the same position as you
and I think that's what you put a like
think like everybody is on the same
phone so go out make new friends and
enjoy your time while you're at school
so my first tip for you guys is to start
going to bed earlier a few days before
you go back to school
and also everybody helps if a few days
before you set your alarm in the morning
because then getting used to waking up
not more time not like really really
late any time and I definitely know in
the holidays you like to be a little bit
lazy you like to have lines and you get
end rolled up for her tapas and when you
go back to school it can be a massive
shot getting up in the morning
my tip number two when setting your
alarm to get you up in the morning
something that I really find helpful is
to say your lure with like your favorite
song or a song that you really enjoy and
a song that you don't mind like being
repetitive because let's face it none of
us like waking up to that because come
on just what I love your phone a console
wrote me like oh it just puts you in
such a bad mood from the minute you get
up so if you have a song that you enjoy
when you get off its gonna put you in
like such a better mood
my third tip get yourself a planner
slash diary this one from Staples
actually is like both it has a notebook
it has a planner and I read it has
everything in it so it's really really
good
this will honestly be one of the most
useful things you will ever ever get
like if written school or college I'm
not really a poor guy's person so I
found having a planner really really
helped me whereas in school it's really
good because you could just write like
assignment days when you have things
that are due in and those and stuff that
you can just like easily look back on
number four so preparing things in
advance making sure you have all the
essentials that you're going to need so
things that I would always take to
school would be a line notebook of
course biro pens pencils rubbers
highlighters I find these are so useful
for school color pencils or far tips
whichever you prefer obviously you're
gonna need a pencil case otherwise all
just going to be like scattered around
your bag and then of course a calculator
number five so this is like a revision
tip if you have an exam coming up or a
test coming up basically if you get
post-it notes and you think of around
your room somewhere like the really
obvious where you're always looking or
save result like your tube brush on your
phone if you're right on there what you
need to know for example when I done
Spanish in school I wrote down like all
the words I needed to know and I stuck
them on my door the first thing I looked
at when I open my door was a sticky note
so like it reminded me then it went
indoors when you're going out sit in a
picture on your lock screen on your
phone I think I mentioned this in
another video also really really hard if
you're like me ill up your phone 24/7 so
it's the first thing that you look at so
it's really really helpful
number six so preparing healthy meals or
like healthy snacks and right before I
find this really house because if I
don't prepare like a healthy snack
before I go to school I end up just like
grabbing the first thing I see because
I'm most likely be in a rush so it end
up being like a sugary quick ting that I
let you just grab out the drawer which
is really not good for you because it
makes you feel tired and sluggish for
the whole day so grabbing something
healthy is so much better for you so if
we prepare it the night before it just
gave me so much easier and it's going to
be the first thing that you take out
also try and have a healthy breakfast
because it's the most important meal of
the day it's actually my favorite
holiday write in the comments bellow if
it's your favorite milk because it's
mine just one so this is a matter of
opinion but if you guys are trying to
eat healthy and you'll have your like a
really like bland or like plain
breakfast but do fruit on top of it I
never thought it would make such a
difference it tastes so much better
especially banana in cereal oh my
goodness it's the best
Ginty suitable bag I didn't realize into
a year 11 that a backpack is so much
more useful than a hand bike I carried
out five from year 7 to year 10 and then
in year 11 I discovered backpacks and
they were the best thing that's ever
happened to me they're just so much more
useful and like so much more comfy as
well so this back bike is staples
actually said to me and it is so
practical it's so useful it has so many
different compartments and at the
backing even fit a laptop up to 16 inch
which is really cool as well so have
like so many different like pockets in
it is so practical so I love this and
I'm also going to be including this in
my giveaway at the end of the video so
at the cover
number eight so this is like the top tip
for you guys if you have new school
shoes what I recommend you guys to do is
wear them in a couple days before you go
back to school so just weather around
the house for a couple of hours because
there's nothing worse and going back to
school and getting solicitors buy your
shoes where you have home or move in and
they just end up rubbing and it hurts
you don't want to end up spending the
rest of the week just by limping around
trust me and speaking from experience
number nine so don't be afraid to ask
questions because I know when I was at
school sometimes I'll be afraid to ask
something I feel embarrassed but one the
teacher brie doesn't care they suffer
when you ask questions and get involved
and I'll just that as well pretty much
every other kid in khartoum I guarantee
if you don't know it they're probably
not going to know it too and they're
probably get it wrong barrister asks as
well so just put a hand up and ask don't
be afraid because you're not going to
get touched by it
number ten so this is my last tip for
you guys impossible arrange to meet a
friend before you go into school because
it's going to make it less daunting when
you go in but if you don't know anybody
at the school if it's a new school don't
worry you're definitely going to make
new friends there are so many people who
are in the same position as you as well
Celebi are that's my 10 top tips and
