hi guys welcome back to my channel so
summer is here well kind of if we're in
the UK it's kind of fierce and all of
you guys will be going on summer
holidays and if you're not going through
on some other day you might even just
live in a really nice hot sunny country
that I'm very very very jealous so
whatever you are doing this summer
hopefully this video will help you out
these are definitely some of my favorite
some items that I have picked up so far
I hope you guys enjoy and let's into
this video mercy before I start telling
you guys about all the like gorgeous
things are happier I'm gonna talk to you
about a really pretty exciting and let's
just say an amazing apps I just
discovered basically Rimmel London asked
me a while ago if I would check out the
new app called get alert I did and
there's just say I love it so so much so
really want you to share with you guys
because I've been using it quite a lot
and it's not just something I would just
use in the summer and then I use it all
throughout the year and try out new
lamps and create new styles so basically
how this app works is say for example
you squatted an Instagram feed and you
see someone you are like damn their
makeup is on fleek and you want to go
create their makeup look or let's say
for example your friend had a really
really good makeup or you see a
celebrity in a magazine
wherever basically you can literally
steal their look or work this out don't
what you do is you open the Rimmel get
the look app and then you click on
silver look and then you hold the camera
over the place so you're trying to copy
the makeup look from and you hold it
there for five seconds making sure the
whole face fix in the oval and then you
wait for it to turn green when that's
done you click on the try on button and
the camera switch is round 2 in selfie
mode and takes your pictures and then
repress the look on you which i think is
absolutely amazing
I found this especially good for trying
out lipstick
and different eyeshadow colors and
promises that I absolutely love them
there cough not only that this app shows
you what promo products she would need
to recreate the look and also you can
order the products like on the app which
i think is really cool so the other day
when I was recruit another a lot of you
guys actually really noticed you guys
were like on my bro continues like go
your eyebrows on fleek I was like I
stole up so this was actually the
eyeshadow palette that I used and this
is the glam eyes HD and I loved it a lot
and then I was using this mascara the
scandalize mascara and it's also
waterproof and then all my goodness I
actually love this this is the Rimmel
Kate collection of the boho nude oh my
goodness is actually amazing I'm
actually going to show you this right
now because it's such a gorgeous nude I
love it so incredibly much so I'm going
to leave the download link in the
description below so go check it out
I mean it's free so you have absolutely
nothing to lose in fact if you do decide
to recreate a look the entire meal
because that will be awesome I would
definitely be checking them out so check
away the hashtags get the looks to look
yeah that would be awesome
oh by the way guys what I'll do is I'll
actually insert a picture of my makeup
look today and then maybe you guys could
try that out I don't know yeah I'd be
pretty cool it's the time we do do that
moving on so I've actually got two pairs
of sunglasses you wouldn't see me wear
these a lot of you follow my vlog
channel so many of you guys have asked
where these from and I do absolutely
nothing
however I scratch them so badly these
are from River Island I think there was
something like 15 pounds so this is on
yeah yeah it's like a pinky God and I
love they are very different to any
sunglasses that I've had before which is
why I love them
and then also I only got these yesterday
actually I got these from Aldo and they
were 12 pounds which I was very
surprised about because I passed
anything they look so much more
expensive than they are and I love them
they're really really cool so yeah by
the way everything that I'm going to be
showing you guys today I'm gonna
in the description below so you guys can
go check it out like sadly welcome
finally facing I'm so excited to show
you guys I haven't actually had a chance
to use it yet but I am so excited to use
it I'm so excited that I've got it okay
so this is something you definitely need
for a festival or if you're going down
to the beach into something that you
might use as well it's definitely a
summer essential and this is the vampire
everybody needs a bum bag and this is
mine it is so so pretty it has like
silver glitter all over it and then has
a gold tip at the front and then it also
has of gold zip at the back so you could
probably actually bit quite a lot in
here even though it is very small but
yeah it's going to be so useful do want
to make favorite so much sin chills
you're probably gonna need a bikini this
time art I actually have two bikinis to
show you this one's actually my favorite
of the two and this one is from H&M I
think the top was like $12.99 and the
bottom was like $7.99 so it's like a
very reasonable price and it's really
really good quality so it's like this
palm tree blueprint and I just love it
just anything about palm trees or
anything tropical just give me those
summery vibe so I'm like yes I need that
in my life so I wore this a lot on
holiday and just say back from holiday
so I wore this one a lot and here on the
matching bottoms as well Allah says does
like a really reasonable price and the
same exists on this one was 15-pound
with the top and for the bottom which is
actually crazy it came in a set however
it's not actually as good quality as
that one but still it is really really
nice it's from misguiding and it's just
like pink and orange but like is that
bright pink and I love bright pink
it's like fuchsia pink it has like
padding in it as well which i think is
really really nice and then the bottom
is just matching again pink or the two
orange strings on the side a new
obsession of mine that I'm totally in
love with is the Abeka
Japan Herald champagne pop highlighter
I've seen so many people raving about
this so I was so bored to dry it and
what I did I just fell in love like it's
absolutely amazing it's such a pigmented
high
and your house like a mix between a gold
in the white shimmer I love it so much I
put you show you what it looks like
I think it cost me $38 because I got it
in America so this is what the packaging
looks like and then it just got like
such a strong amazing so much I'm in
love
also masters in America I've got one a
lot of makeup but do someone like your
necklaces I absolutely love they broke
my Anastasia Beverly Hills and naked and
also milkshake now naked is like a duty
color and milkshake I have always liked
a gloss on top it's like a really really
light pink honey
so gorgeous it's so nice for the summer
so if you go on holiday to find a
Sephora or you go online and like get
anything from Anastasia Beverly Hills I
definitely recommend these colors
they're very summery
and they are gorgeous now if you think
he's gay and you're not going on holiday
then this is something I definitely
recommend and this is the Garnier body
summer body moisture added in some kids
look it is amazing I've actually use
this for years
mm and I abused this for so so long
you're not using it now okay oh I'm not
very private oh so basically what it is
it's a tinted moisturizer so it's kind
of like a mix between like a fake Chad
and of oyster Iser so like is really
really easy to apply that's why I wake
up thanks to using fake tan I both bake
time could be very scary
so biggity with this is like you can
build up over day like after day this is
really good if like you're starting to
get a tan because if you apply this it
just kind of builds it up so yeah it's
really good to build so I'm just gonna
throw this in here and this is the bath
and Bodyworks antibacterial hand spray
now in the summer my house can get rid
sweaty I don't know those really grows
that fight pretty much everyone even in
my hand so it gets ready to get I just
like to have clean hands like I'm always
using an antibacterial like gel but then
I found this spray which I was like
majorly so talked about I was like no
where do they have a spray I've never
seen an antibacterial spray maybe you
guys within the love
I never had before and I saw embark upon
e1 I think it was $3 it was hard prices
you owe me $6 it smells so good it's
like it's just so going back to the
place of always that now you're gonna
need a rain jacket most likely because
it rains every - well every time I go to
a festival it is always always right I
don't think there's ever been a time
where I ever go to a festival and it
hasn't rained so we've got mess up my
rain jacket
it probably won't rain this time now
I've got myself a rain jacket I'm gonna
wear anyway because I love it you guys
might think I'm crazy because it's very
out there and it's very noisy but it is
just me like it is I just love it so
much
I saw somebody else have it and then I
throw it on both her and I was like no
way I need this so this one it looks
like it has to like really big pockets
as well that I find is really useful
because you could fit a lot in it so I'm
definitely gonna be wearing this with my
really adorable bum bag my cat so a lot
of you guys have been asking me where I
got this wrong again it's the bright
pink it is it very me there's not much
to say about it it's a New York Yankees
cap I love it is from Topshop I think it
was something like 20 pounds so yeah
it's very minute this hat comes in like
all different colors so you can get it
for like so many more places and
drop-shot bar that's why I've got my
from and they do so many different kinds
of red blue white last but not least
again it is another bright pink item and
this time it actually is from pink I got
it from pink in America I also have the
matching top as well because I loved it
that much so it's just like a really
night weight hoodie it's actually one of
the most fun girly hoodies my up ever
won and it's so lightweight so like it's
something you can just chop on the
summer and you won't get like really hot
so I'm sure be getting a lot of use out
of this within the next week that's the
end of my video I really hope you guys
enjoyed and hopefully you found this
video helpful as well let me know about
