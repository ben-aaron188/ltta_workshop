hi guys and welcome back to my channel
today I'm doing a favorites of the month
video which I'm so excited about because
I have so many various this month and
you guys have been requesting this video
a lot and I should really do a lot more
favorites videos as I hardly ever do
there in today's video I'm trying to
include a bit of everything from my
favorite app to my favorite makeup to my
favorite hair products literally
everything you can think of my favorite
youtubers etcetera etcetera also before
I actually get into this video I just
want to say I am doing a insane giveaway
where you guys can win an iPad air 2 and
not only that some of my favorite makeup
products that will be popping up on the
screen now so I am so excited so make
sure you come on watching so you can
find out how easy it is to win and let's
get into it okay so the first things I'm
going to speak about us to makeup items
and the first things are the lime crime
lipsticks oh my goodness
I am obsessed with these honestly this
is the best liquid to matte lipsticks
I've ever tried
I actually prefer them to the kylie
jenner and the jeffree star ones they
are so good and their colors are amazing
the color I'm mainly obsessed with is
bolete I wear all the time
I don't actually have one now but it is
amazing and I got these from dog skills
so I will link them in the description
below and then also I just want to talk
about this color from NYX it's such a
nice lip gloss I'm actually wearing it
right now like recently everybody has
been raving about this hair straightener
brushes over on Instagram and YouTube
pretty much everywhere so I thought why
not give wanna dye their eyes I'm
missing out so I ordered one from
stitcher color and let's just say it
really really does do the job this is my
brush here I used it this morning to
straighten my hair it really really does
Wow
basically it does what it says on the
box that says save time no more phones
in a rush this brush it does is that
free that it's so good it doesn't burn
you obviously because it's just like a
hair brush and I'm just that as well
also save space because when you're
coming out you don't need to bring a
hair straightener and a brush you can
make sure you just bring this as it's 2
and 1 all I can say is I've been using
it a lot I definitely recommend it to
you guys
another good thing as well is it heats
up pretty fast though I'm loving that so
yeah if you haven't already use one of
these why not go try one out because
they are really really good oh yeah it's
so now I'm going to talk about my new
favorite athlete uh ball which honestly
I am so excited to speak about because I
only just discovered it don't actually
have any followers on it yet because
I've only just started using it but it
is so much fun and what yeah Bal is it's
a new social messaging app for groups so
you can upload photos and videos and the
cool thing about it which is why it's so
much better than other apps in my
opinion you can add stickers and emojis
on top of the pictures which just looks
so cute I'm put this picture here as you
can tell I'm sticking my tongue out so I
put a pair of lips where it's sticking
your tongue out so I love this art with
so much knowing that as well on this app
you can do voting on pictures so on this
bitch a new video question mark types of
or whole and then if you guys follow me
you convert which videos you want to see
next so types of or a whole that was
home and also you can add like locations
and videos so it's really really cool
and then there's also like an explorer
page where you can explore other
people's profiles which is actually
really cool because I'm quite new to
this app like there isn't anybody that I
actually knew had this app then I was
scrolling down as like a company how
many people I know one here so yeah I
really Pierce if this is gonna be like
the next big social media platform
everybody's going to be having it so if
you haven't already downloaded it
definitely go do that and go follow me
which brings me on to my competition
basically how you win all these amazing
prices that I mentioned at the beginning
of the video is you just have the
downloadable follow me on it and then
obviously subscribe to my youtube
channel and then on this app on Thursday
the 9th of June I will basically be
announcing the winner on my profile so
go follow me if you haven't already just
want to point out as well is that was
really really easy to use just download
it from the App Store create an account
which is so easy and then just like any
other app you just click upload and then
it says photo video etc set that
so I really hope you guys going download
it because to be honest I'm really no
need down here by myself because I have
new followers
so my name is Salim Barca that would be
really meaningful to face primer now I
got this about couple of weeks ago for
makeups it's so nicely on top of it and
it's amazing packaging as well so love
this you've got to give this a bit
moving on
so this oh my goodness I have this
cropped silk cocky green bomber jacket
well let me just say so so so many of
you guys all do where this is from when
I wore it last weekend like it was crazy
how many people asked me and this is
actually from Zara I loved it so much I
just think it's so trendy and it's so
cool and it's so key then it's cropped
and then also when I wore this last
weekend I also wore there's camouflage
top that's from River Island and so many
of you guys are aware this is from as
well they go so well together by the way
and yeah this is from River Island also
at love it again everything's gonna be
linked in the description now I haven't
actually got these in the packet as I
wiring them right now but I hardly ever
ever wear fake eyelashes it hasn't
really been a thing for me I'm kind of
just find them too hard on that I never
really wear them but I have been using
the petite 107 ella is a how you
pronounce it
I think I'm guessing these are my
favorite eyelashes at the moment they're
like quite petite they're not too much
and they are so so my favorite youtubers
of them on now I'm not gonna go on and
talk about my all-time favorite
youtubers like a leech Marie because I
think I mentioned her and many other
youtubers like that in every video so my
favorites of this month I would have to
say I'm absolutely loving Miss Hannah
Beauty she has 80,000 subscribers and
her channel is awesome like I love it so
much
every time she uploads I get so excited
so I'm gonna need couple though her
videos are really good also I'm noting
Tara Michele
heavy is are so good and have logs are
so awesome as well too
but that's like really it I haven't
really got any like new youtubers that
I'm loving though just kind of like
stuck to the old ones that I really want
to find out some more so if you guys
have any suggestions of any youtubers
they can be small they can be big they
let me know in the comments below
because that would be really helpful for
me and then I can go check them out and
hopefully hopefully subscribe spectrum
brushes oh my goodness look how
beautiful these are rose gold and white
my favorite colors you can't get these
the different colors but I chose his
colors as they are my all-time faves I
have been wanting to use these in such a
long time now I've had these for two
weeks and I haven't been able to touch
them because I wanted to keep them brand
new for this video
because they look how gorgeous they are
when they're brand new I get everything
messy so I just couldn't touch them
although I - but they were like too
small I was like you can't really notice
that much but there are just so gorgeous
I was so happy
I know these are gonna be amazing
because the two that I use and then also
when they're I got this gorgeous marble
bag that I think was like 1699 oh my
goodness you guys know I love marble as
well so this is just like them as a
perfect makeup bag and brush that for me
don't brush twice and light myself then
definitely go check out their website
because they have so many different
colors with so many different designs
another positive thing about this as
well is they are vegan and they are also
43 so yeah that means a lot or so just
who you want to mention these that shook
about hair determined again because I
mentioned them cover them on fat and
then I completely ran out because I hate
them too quickly good yeah these are be
my favorites of the month again because
I really do feel as if they make my
hands thumbs on the car so easily again
yes sir
last but not least hello my new daily
vlogging camera now I kind of wish I
didn't have to buy this but I lost my
 camera so I had to go and get a
new one and then I kind of got a bit
carried away and got this camera which I
prefer so much more to the canon g7x
which is what I did have this is the
Sony rx100 Mark 4 and the quality is
insane like I love it so much and it has
like a slip up spring ring tonight and
I'll set that up it has awesome slow-mo
it's just amazing and I finished it
my vlog is going to be even better
quality now so yes you haven't already
subscribe to my tunnel and make
sure you do that it's in the description
below as well as everything else that I
mentioned so from Basco vlogs go check
it out the only downside of this towards
for that it was so expensive it was like
a big investment for me but in my
opinion it's definitely worth it because
I've left school now basically I get to
blog a hell of a lot more so yeah
definitely worth the money but oh so
that's the end of this month's favorites
or should I say like the past couple of
months because I haven't done one in
such a long time so I hope you guys
