channel and welcome to my room tour
finally finally I'm doing this video
which I'm so excited for as I said that
kind of time it is my most requested
video ever so thank you guys for
requesting this video because I'm so
excited for it and not only that if you
guys watch my blog channel you want to
own those untidy person in the whole
entire universe like my bedroom is
always messy I seem to be tidying it all
the time but it never ever seems to get
the spot that stain and right now it's
spotless I spent all day tidying up my
mom is so pardon me she's like oh yeah
and I'm like oh yeah and voila oh yeah
so I hope you guys enjoy this video make
sure you smash that big thumbs up if you
do and let's get into it
the first thing you see when you walk
into my bedroom is my bed and it takes
up most of my bedroom and then of course
I put my unicorn sigh loved so much and
if I'm not editing or filming or
vlogging then I probably start going up
to my uniform
so my curtains are from Ikea and the
curtain tiebacks are from home scents
and they were 25 now I also have a plain
white black our blind which you can
practically get from anywhere but I
think this one was for Margot
don't let me down
so this desk area here is where I do
most of my editing and filming and
school worker bits like that so inside
my desk here as you can tell I have lots
of like revision booklets mainly maps at
the top here it just knows if I work and
pen fits like that I need to do for
school my desk honestly I cannot
remember where it's from and neither can
my mom but she actually got it off a
shabby-chic shop on ebay if you tried
shabby chic on the Internet
honestly all of my furniture came over
I'm including my bed - it is one of my
most asked questions ever supplemental
bed from typing shabby chic on the
internet on eBay and you'll definitely
be bound to find it like differently and
then on top of my desk I have this glass
top that my dad actually made for me
because the only thing with this
furniture is it can get really dirty
especially when you love makeup just as
much as myself and I tend to do makeup
all over my furniture which I really
shouldn't but yeah it seems to get
really dirty so my dad made me there so
it is like oh I'm so glad it's just made
things so much easier and then on his
desk I also have lots of like perfumes
and scarf this Jimmy Choo Ross and
perfume I actually got in December I got
for Christmas actually for my auntie
it's like my go-to perfume I love it so
much every time I wear it somebody
complements me and every time I also a
lady minions somebody complements me as
well so yeah that's why I got my persons
what most my perfumes I get from
fragrance direct just as it's like so
much easier just ordering online and
actually going shopping get in it and
then I have my Burberry sunglasses that
I absolutely love oh cause my Polaroids
I absolutely love taking polaroid
pictures the only thing is they are so
expensive everybody knows that so like I
only do it on like really special
occasions as you'll see on a minute the
mirror over there is like covered in
oats in Polaroids so I love this it is
very dirty but I really want to get like
a light blue or like pink one but this
one actually got from Urban Outfitters
and then of course this candle oh my
goodness I love this one and the one
over there so much farther Bodyworks is
the most incredible shop and
unfortunately we don't have here in the
UK and then this eunuch on tape I just
generally thought was cute and this is
from Luna and then finally of course
because I do all my editing here on my
laptop my laptop cases from unique finds
just going to be honest with you the
laptop cases are amazing their watch is
not a lot of cases the laptop sticker
they are amazing but they are so
expensive the delivery and the tax
charge are like awful like is so bad and
then this Michael Kors laptop case
really wasn't expensive it's from TK
Maxx and I think it was 25 or $29.99
which for Michael Kors is seriously not
a lot of n obviously more revision and
booklets there other than this being to
see that I sit on this is also a really
cute storage box and as you can tell
it's like in the shape of a love heart
and in here I keep my things like scarf
hat gloves just like accessories and
stuff and this is actually from madam an
and then these really really cute
unicorn servers that RT from Amazon they
were present for my nan and I live in
dying me is these are my favorite things
ever speaking Sinhalese couldn't tell me
who's chilling with this home
and Disney can try stop you off you got
your head so obviously he's my wardrobe
but on my wardrobe I have this adorable
hat from nice store in America I don't
know why it's adorable
but I love it so much yeah this is one
of my latest purchases this is from new
look I love this if you see my Instagram
you know that I'm wearing it all the
time now obviously actually getting on
with my wardrobe so I have a little pose
here this is just like clothes so I need
I can not that can't fold it up and then
to be honest I do have quite a lot of
shoes shoes alike my favorite thing ever
you just can't have 2 mintues and this
coming do just has like jumpers and
joggers here and then fare somebody at
the bottom and up here is a right mess I
really really need to sort this out this
just has programs of like West End shows
I've been to and concerts and stuff like
that and then of course I have my loser
McGuire movies is actually really funny
because a minute ago my mum actually
asked me why have you still got the MS
McGuire move and I was like that was the
show and I was younger you know
so obviously I'm still gonna have them
in my cupboard in case I want to watch
them again so comment down below if you
used to watch this McGuire and if you
didn't go watch it like on YouTube or
something because it was the bomb it was
the show that everybody watched so this
is my main Chester drawers and my TV
which to be honest I hardly ever use or
hardly ever watch TV and as you can see
I've got a few ornaments and pictures on
the job
now
don't let me down
me down
so may I have these makeup holders and
makeup drawers from Amazon I wanted them
for such a long time
they're lifesavers definitely worth the
money and then in here I just have like
a load of lipsticks mainly Mac and then
a few L'Oreal but I'm not going to go
through like all windows things now so
if you want me to do like a makeup
flexion they let me know in the comments
below or vote on the poll up there and
then just like some foundations now then
I'm the type of holder that use holds
like brushes and stuff this is like the
part is where I'm really doing my wife
to put I just jump in there and then
obviously more perfumes and spray this
is the other don't fall this is the
other perfume I said I live and die for
it amazing and that is 280 million and
again I got that for a good direct and
then I have my everyday makeup bag I
like tend to swap them round cuz I like
wash one and then put the makeup and the
other and vice versa like all the time
these sunglasses I got from boohoo there
were only six pounds and then this here
I have analysis so many times for the
works so much is actually from a race it
was originally my mom's but now we share
it because I kind of stole it and now we
share it and then this here was from PS
pink and then of course I have all about
my Polaroids and little pictures I
absolutely love up here these are my
friends I haven't stick in so long it's
the battery car that they bought me so
yeah this is my friends that I met on
holiday and I love them so much though I
love this so much and obviously here
those are polarized anyone I went to
Egypt with my family this is me and my
older brother or his dad by V that was
so much fun
don't block that guy no I do oh my god
guys I just when did I fall then and I
just thought I hadn't even started
YouTube then in May I still had been
done YouTube which is just insane that's
so weird
so yeah that was so much fun I wish I
could have booked that I hadn't even
started YouTube them I'm gonna go up a
few or and to show you
domi chillin this always is in these
drawers here this drawer is just full of
tons and tons of makeup to be honest I'm
not like every other youtuber there
their makeup looks so organized and Sony
and so good all the time
I am very unorganized and messy so my
makeup drawer looks well very very messy
by definitely I'm trying to be more
organized so I definitely will sort this
out very soon then this bottom drawer
here is literally just full of makeup
bags and wash box as you can see I have
a bit over love for wood bar to make us
bad I just can't resist
I just don't really think you can have
too many and then this box over here was
a box of old maid cart that I used to
have years and years ago I don't use it
I kind of just use it as a little stool
to put my curling tongs and my hair
straighteners because that's mainly
where do my hair and then them towels on
top are just like for makeup if I ever
decide to do on my floor and then I have
two towels there because obviously I've
got white floor whenever I decide to do
my makeup on the floor lay those towels
off so basically my fault doesn't get
dirty so that was my bedroom I really
