hi everyone and welcome back to my
channel so today's video honestly I have
absolutely no idea what I'm gonna call
it yet because today's video is about
all the things that I've had maybe for a
long time maybe an open on our talk but
that I wear a lot we doesn't even have
to be things that I wear it could just
be things that I use and stuff that you
may have seen my flaws and this is just
a video about the things if you guys
constantly tweet me or ask me or like
comment on my vlogs and stuff and say
where did you get that top from where
did you get it from
and I reply to you guys nodes but
obviously there's more of you coming in
all of the time which is amazing and
therefore I mean you guys don't know
whether I transform even though that's
very myself like a hundred times today I
thought why not do a video about all the
things that you guys constantly ask me
these are there's like top things that
you guys asked me where I got it from if
there's something else I haven't
included in this video then make sure
you let me know in the comments below
and hopefully I can reply to you or like
Ally somebody else's comment it's like
do you agree with them so therefore I
know that's the thing that you really
want to know but to be honest I think
I've covered like the things that you
guys mostly want to know it's kind of
like the famous video in a whole video
so I hope you guys enjoy it and let's
get into it so I'm gonna start off with
like my most requested off the thing
ever and this is my uniform my little
baby I love her so much
J taught me this and this is actually
from Toys R Us I think here originally
was 60 pounds exactly now on sale to go
up on what you can they are amazing an
oddity I sleep with mine because she's
so calm for you to so much more comfy
than a pillow so I love her definitely
recommend especially if you have a
unicorn obsession like myself the next
item is possibly also and the most are
things I've I've had this for probably
just over half a year now a very very
long time well actually it's a long time
basically this is this cop tonight
jacket it is amazing I love it so so
much but unfortunately you guys can't
get it because they got it from like a
vintage retro shop so therefore they
only had one of like every item so I
have no idea where else you can get it I
tried to like a google it and see if
there's any more bar I can find any
anywhere so no tip for you guys is make
sure you go check out like these vintage
Metro shop because obviously from the
outside they really don't look much but
when you go inside and you have rummage
you can find like one of things there
for being things that other people can't
go get so it's really really great and
you can find really really cool things
that I love going there as well there's
so much fun just like rummaging through
your notes I don't really know if you
guys have mini like retro shops where
you guys live in vitam we have loads and
loads and loads so if you ever get the
chance to visit Brighton definitely go
check them out because they're very
really cool okay so my next item is this
burgundy and orange for my jacket
although when it's on to burnish you
can't really see the orange that much if
you actually regulate if you watch my
blogs you definitely would have seen me
in this loads of times it's so warm and
it's so so comfy and let's just say
bomber jackets are so in this season in
fact those the last season as well and
the proper going to be in in summer so
in fact they're probably going to be in
the whole year I love for my jacket so
so much I also think we had this one in
a car key green color as well and it's
definitely reasonably priced as well
it's between like 15 to 25 pounds I
think so I'd definitely link that in the
trip to below because yeah I've worn
this so much and it so can't say oh oh
my boy and this one I just want to say
where it's problem because I completely
forgot what the whole video is about and
this is from misguided I would
definitely link it below okay it's so my
laptop cover know this isn't really a
case it's just the sticker peppers
anything it looks amazing a lot of you
guys are through though is it cracked
no it isn't cracked because my laptop is
not white because it's an Apple map
although with a great four bits wife but
it's not this laptop sister I got
watching my mum got from unique finds I
absolutely love it they have no
different colors they have it in black
they have I given effects and stuff
although to be fair it was very
expensive and after we receive then they
decided to
charges taxes then met my mum ended up
paying an extra twenty five pounds which
is absolutely ridiculous
so this possibly was the most expensive
laptop sticker ever bigger again is very
very very very nice this I love this so
much this is one of my favorite items
ever ever ever this is a camouflage
denim looking cropped jacket oh my
goodness the second I saw I fell in love
and now I'm still absolutely love it I
wear it all the time
it goes well with so many things and
this is from booboo I think it was 25
pounds definitely worth the money it's a
very good quality
it looks like it's denim but it isn't
it's like a lot thinner material and
others so much you would a silly wear
like my Instagram pictures and stuff so
like I'll pop some pictures up there of
me wearing it but yeah this is
definitely one of my favorite ways I
think ever the other thing is this black
top with white stripes I also have it
white with black stripes it's the thing
that goes well with pretty much
everything I've worn it with this jacket
a lot and this was 10 pounds from boohoo
also and obviously the white one was
from voodoo and then this hat here I get
asked quite a lot as well I wore it in
the summertime and then I hadn't worn it
in ages and then I wore it how long ago
about three weeks ago and a lot of you
guys asked for an Instagram picture and
this was just from the night store as it
has the night little tick yeah so the
necklace is I'm wearing right now which
I also get asked a lot which actually
are quite angled right now but I love
wearing the phone because I love both so
much
they are both from Tiffany in color I
got one of them was gifted from my
boyfriend and one of them was gifted
from my mum and dad and I love them and
unobtainable
my final item that I've got ours very
recently where I got it from with them
only had it recently this jacket here it
looks quite weird on camera but it's
really really nice I love this there in
fact that you can zip it up we're going
to be fair I don't think I ever how does
it go but you know what I mean that's
cool
yeah yeah this is ones are this was
roughly 25 pounds Barry I hope you guys
enjoyed this video it was something a
bit different because I thought why not
as long you guys ask me this stuff so so

helpful for you guys I absolutely loved
