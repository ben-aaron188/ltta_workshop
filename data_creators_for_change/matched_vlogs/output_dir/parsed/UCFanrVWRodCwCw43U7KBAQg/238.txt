hello everybody and welcome back to my
channel so today I'm doing a favorite
German audio over and a half of food
prep area so it's not really let my
January or my February favourites just
like favourites of 2016 so far
it probably could change next month but
these are my favorite things I'm saying
so far I want to start doing favors
either every month or every other month
so let me know in the comments below if
you'd like to see that and to think I'm
going to start with the makeup products
so my first makeup product I'm going to
talk about I'm absolutely loving is the
bourgeois one two three foundation now
I'm using this as an everyday foundation
now it's so good for covering it's what
I'm wearing today and it's so easy to
apply
I've always been using powder
foundations as a lot of you may know
liquid foundations have never been good
for my skin I've never been able to like
put them on my skin it you've been too
cakey or too oily or just not like my
skin whether this one I'm loving so much
and it's so easy to apply how I came
across with finding this foundation I
was looking in the magazine my mom is
actually both and it was like the top
ten foundations Misco time it was like
Chanel Giorgio Armani like loads of
really high expensive foundations and
then we came across the bourgeois one
and the reason we chose this because
that video was like in this it's in a
temple market but it's out there with
all the high ends once we've got why not
give it a go
and I'm so glad we did because it's so
good and it feels so nice on your skin
it's kind of like a dry oil
it's just this is amazing I definitely
definitely recommend you the second
product now this is makeup related
although it's an actually makeup and
this is the Garnier cleansing water and
it is amazing that I think it was the
last favorites idea I think I've
actually only ever done one favorites I
had this in it as well and it's doing my
favorites because it still worked
miracles like it's so amazing you just
get some cotton wool and it wipes off
your makeup so easier whereas I find
face wipes really itch my face and like
they can sting off dry make your face go
red and they really dry your skin out
there
goofer in the environment and this is
literally like water or though removes
all of your many parts it Mitch Lee
works miracles definitely definitely
recommend this as well this got here one
you can get from super trucking foods
although I think in Primark they do a
cheaper one that isn't obviously the
same made but it's cheaper and it works
so well as well so if you have a Primark
maybe go stop over there because this is
also really good so my father maker
products are going to talk about are
like absolute favorite is maybelline
instant age I eraser and it's just
amazing like I've been using this for I
think a month now this is my second one
because I work through the first one so
fast this is amazing and say Mike you're
going out and going for much makeup on
you could just put a couple of doubts of
this and your spots on your blemishes
are just gone like that it's it works
miracles not only that as well it's so
good to highlight I get there's only two
shades think there's new tonight I get
the shade light and it's amazing and
it's so good for contouring obviously is
this an IRA is light so dude for
covering the fibers make your eyes and
making it look so much like beak on your
eyes and like highlight it around your
eyes it's just amazing it's $7.99 so
obviously you can get cheaper concealers
but this one I think is definitely worth
every single penny
I've used other computers before and
then I stopped using them which is the
reason why I never use concealer support
what's really like the point but then I
got this and I completely understand why
everyone needs concealer or when they
use this one anyway because it is
amazing but also white absolutely love
about it it's a sponge that it has at
the end it's just really cool it's
really nice in the skin so definitely go
pick yourself up one of these moving on
to my favorite vloggers and my favorite
youtubers I've got a couple in my notes
this is like my 2016 favorite so far
well as it says in the title of this
video obviously my favorite focus I'm
absolutely loving at the moment are
Emery can energy boys dogs I'm loving
dates because he's skiing and I'm so so
jealous and Emily I really enjoyed her
balls as well because they've moved into
their new flat so it's really nice to
watch like how the decorating in itself
and then of course
my favorite ever growing outward if you
don't watch him I don't know how his
family are the cutest and he's always
doing something absolutely amazing every
single day so definitely go check out
his vault because they are actually
awesome they are so cool so my favorite
youtubers
now a youtuber that I've been loving for
ages by really started watching her
videos all the time now is flirty
thought she may need help like favorites
videos and poems and like reviews on
products and like new products that are
coming out so she's more of a girly
youtuber but hers are really really good
and she's always like recommending new
products and stuff so I'm loving her
videos and new youtuber that I've just
discovered as well who is absolutely
stunning I'm not sure why we be able to
pronounce her name
Danielle mansueta I think that's how you
pronounce her name
she's also another really really girly
you too but she does like makeup
tutorials they're like routine videos
and yet hers is just amazing because
she's stunning as well and like her back
ones thank you another youtuber that I
mostly loving at the moment is David our
key so he's like an up-and-coming
YouTube and his videos are really
relatable and enjoyable to watch in fact
how I thought it was because he's always
so lovely and he's always been really
supportive my videos always share my
videos and stuff so that's actually how
I came across finding him and actually I
really enjoyed videos I'm always
watching them so don't you go watch it
if you like relatable five videos
because they will definitely make it out
moving on to clothe items only have two
clothing items but I love them a lot the
first code item is to do with gym wear
and these are a d-dad running sports
McInnes I got these from JD I think what
I love about it is I'm absolutely in
love with baby pink at the moment it's
like my new obsession I love like all
globes are baby pink so when I saw these
I fell in love and I just love padding
up sports work so these were a must the
second I saw them I honestly have no
idea how much
so our links are below and they're
really popular stuff these second item
of clothing is this great jumper here
now it's just like a nicer third of a
sweatshirt I think it was 15 pounds for
pennies and what I love about it is I
must equally a fan of high next at 20
but and love family one so this is that
my neck makes really baggy and sits so
so nice on the bottom in a house like
this cute pull string so you can put it
tight so it won't be like more of a cop
drama why are they pretty cute about
this number also it's this pull string
here and you can put it so it's more
like of a crop jump again again it's
still top crop and it's like shorter or
you can have it do this - it's more like
Becky and I'm done I wear it both ways
because I just think it's really nice
and in its really good both ways so that
is so cute about the shopper as well I
love it and you probably see me wear it
a lot this month because I'm loving it
so much
okay so my favorite music at the moment
now my favorite song at the moment that
I think I'll be loving for a very long
time in seven years by Lukas Graham a
lot of my Guinness it has like time to
chill by yourself don't actually
everybody might have things to be
singing at the moaning it's suctioning
so I'm going to absolutely love the song
lyrics in it which is why I love the
song so much so that is one that I'm
definitely loving love was helped by
Justin Bieber well that's my Gretchen if
you've seen my videos if you've seen my
folks if you've watched it on You Now or
anything like that where there's been a
camera I've always listening to love
yourself by Justin Bieber because I am
obsessed with it and pink is another
song I would never ever get more of like
ever in my life used to come I'm still
Romina sings about something so loved it
third so my loving admire was a tough
one I was going to say stick to special
Mendez so I know he came on at Halawa
but after he came out in 2014 I think
your mind right it's only just going
trucks and I never really listened to it
until they came in the chart and so like
it's a really new song to me but I
absolutely love that as well and then
love the music video so that's
definitely my favorite songs in the
movin and moving all that to it series
I'm already watching too many series at
the moment the only serious I am
is the 4400 the 4400 I've been watching
live Jake I think we on these second
series of it now and it is so addictive
and it's so so good but I can't either
like try and explain to you what it's
about because if I meant to say to you
I'm giving you away the whole story it's
like if I tell you one little thing it's
giving it all away
so I makes me comment it to you but all
I can say is I definitely recommend it
because it's so interesting and it's so
good the last item that I want to talk
about today is there's a Joey Malone
perfume and the scent is let me just
remember actions are the most certain
cardamom it smells so good and it's so
refreshing and I can't believe I just
said the names so right because those to
say the struggles to try and pronounce
thing with this perfume is really really
hard it's a unisex perfume and it's
let's just say it's quite pricy I think
it was like 45 pounds of the small
bottle but yet again it's like a tree
and it smells so good and if you haven't
have germinated before it's really good
because they're like perfume they're
really good telling your over each other
whereas if I had this perfume and say
like some other company's perfume and
laid them on top of each other
it just wouldn't smell good it smell
like a mother on board I don't know so
these are really really good even though
Germany can be very pricey literally
once were laughs for ages and it start
listing is perfectly about this
particular one I think anyway it just
smells so good and refreshing and it's
just so gorgeous I really hope you guys
enjoyed my favourites on 2016 so far
looking around me right now
doesn't finish if I thought too much I
think that might be because December I
got so much and I brought so much that I
don't really feel the need to buy
anything house although next month am i
doing another mockney favorites I'm
guessing I'm gonna happen we double the
amount of himself as the probably will
not be fitting I skipped and I don't
want some new pointed out to try if you

think I should try then every know in
