hi everyone before I start this video I
just want to go ahead and say my eyes
are pretty watery right now I haven't
been crying I have a cold she popped out
of my voice but I don't feel ill so I
plan to do this video and I'm going to
go and do it what your article not this
videos about annoying things that girls
do obviously some boys may be able to
relate just as well but this is like
personal things that I find so annoying
about being a girl I'm sure you can read
to some of these two and let's get
straight into the video the first and
most annoying thing about being a girl
is we are like so critical of myself
we're never happy with what we know like
oh I look so ugly
what does my was to me is right I've got
our hair up no way lipstick I'm going to
teach you my face I think that is a bad
enough what we all be like abdication
not feeling critical about herself we
get it boys rely on another girl to do
it for us oh my god have you seen what
she looks like
yeah what's she thinking what happened
to go of her
so who's ever heard of these line or
experienced this before no she got you
quite good for a girl ah cheese or get
I'm all right you know sorry I thought
this is 21st century for a girl it's
annoying and it's patronizing boy is
good wearing a bra wearing a bra has to
be the most uncomfortable irritating
annoying thing you could ever wear on
your entire body like you have these
straps of pulling up your boobs and
they're like this under wiring here no
no no that's like so uncomfortable every
girl knows that feeling when you manage
to take your bra off at the end of the
day before you go into bed it's like
relief it feels so great and boys you
don't even know what we go through
because there just no point complaining
about it because we have to put up with
wearing about every single
so the really obvious one period so if
you haven't already started your periods
I just want to say my advice to you make
the most of it because you're going to
be having a period once a month for me
what 4050 years I don't know what feels
like forever when I'm on my period and
everyone else I know when they're on
their period like our emotions just
change like that I could be from the
happiest person into the most miserable
moody s like every emotion goes free
when you're on your period I'm not just
that period pains are the Watsons back
pains belly pains headaches like it's
just horrible oh boys don't even
understand what girls have to go through
once a month here's an example of how a
really normal situation from going any
direction whatever you knowing hormones
are choosing that day when you're on
your period
oh my God thank you so much of this
Canada like also thought thought I might
also go as well thank you so much why
the hands you give me a scented candle
you're trying to say that my room smells
something oh my god to resent it
you have no idea what I've been through
strawberries like it's my Toyota and Wow
like thank you so much that you do and
you know that I love strawberries which
is just so nice I ain't going believe me
call me a strawberry sets handle so
that's a great thing about being a woman
if you haven't started your period this
is what we were going to go through for
the next God knows how many years I
literally have no idea how long but I'm
just the thought of it so carry open
periods show us love that one you know
how many experienced it yet no a whole
lot of people that have and I tell you
one thing no one I've ever know it has
anything good about childbirth because
why right you're carrying a baby for
nine months you're wanting to get is
bigger or different bigger do you have
to get out the baby which is supposed to
be the most painful thing Indian throw
up and get spot poison have this grades
it how does that work it forgot thing
again
you boys are not lucky you are
overprotective parents
so you just won't you gotta love them
mom I'm going out Jacob tonight Jacob
yeah is that boy
oh yes same Jacob so yeah I know me so
why cuz you're not old enough I'm nearly
16 exactly Jed's got a girlfriend and
he's younger than me it's different fear
Porter boys new portion go to portion
loves annoying thing about beautiful is
why does everyone want to see you that
us females could be like cooking and
cleaning my room is always trash and I'm
probably not the best cook I was going
to say actually my brother's probably
cleaner than me but no dead doctor than
me or better cook than me and episode
might see as well but I know I had a lot
of oils that are tied yummy
to me I'm not gonna either like I will
good at either one of them so there you
have it that's my only things about
being a girl and I'm sure so many of you
have more annoying things about being a
girl and hopefully we boys get it
related to some of that as well
