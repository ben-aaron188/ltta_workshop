hi guys so today I'm trying bazillion
candy as you already know from the title
of this video which I am so so so so so
so excited for Nicole which is Casey's
girlfriend is behind the camera right
now and she is from Brazil so she has
brought me a big box of brazilian candy
which I am dying to try and I've had
these for so long because I wanted
Nicole to sit how and what to me try
them so she's behind the camera doing
that right now
let's get straight into it take off the
lid I didn't have something like this in
English but I'm going to try and mount
these is it tip you bet for better so
that is in the back yeah okay
oh wait good it is look good then I took
the finger is it good right oh my god
they are insane oh my goodness I think
this is one of the best soccer balls
I've ever drive I'm being serious that
is one in question was over time that is
amazing I'm giving that as a now turn
slow good nothing saying that oh my god
I'm so jealous
I will net hmm try this this is the best
thing ever
you have this a lot yeah yeah oh my god
but used to haven't tried my finger ones
really what's your favorite one-by-one
next the second chocolate bar I'm going
to be trying is this also quickly before
we let it get Robin into this video I
feel so weird right now I haven't got my
necklace on that I always have one I
took off earlier for like the first time
ever and I can't remember where I put it
it's only summer in my house but I can't
remember I seem to go on and film this
video
so I've already Bears everyone just
excuse I just needed to tell you cuz
it's fun with right anyway the second
chocolate bar I'm going to be trying
don't want to negro
be fair that is quite English so I have
a feeling this is dark chocolate is it -
yeah I know but it's kind of like
crunches how did the chance like a
normal chocolate bar but it's long ways
which is quite cool right we just get
one or two
I don't know how I feel about this
I'm really I like it but it's weird just
let it melt in your mouth go hey let me
have another bit you really want me to
like it um no no it tastes like he's
really nice like you go into a shop I
probably will dry air but I think if I
just tried that and I absolutely love
that and I think I would get it an eight
and a half and it's still really really
good it is kind of like story in it oh
really
it has it has a good oh no it's like
crunchy chocolate but then it has like a
different taste but yet again Brazilian
chocolate tastier French and English
toffee but I'm not going to over top it
now I'm going to go for these what are
these bubble gum bubble gum
so fatherland is it somebody yeah family
so this is what I'm going for
it's quite cool packaging mmm they smell
so go I have a feeling this is one that
you can't chew what I'm making to be
wrong okay you can yeah yeah yeah I have
to actually really what you see why
that's so much better than huh bubbles
we have an England
oh my gorgeous handy so my feds are I
want to be in Brazil it's like really
really gooey and really really strong
the middle which is so nice oh that's
hard because I do love chewing gum and
apps and I love bubble gum but I do
prefer the chocolate so I think I'm
going to give this a seven and a half
because it is really good for what it is
like I don't think you can make this any
better it just depends of your upon a
bubble going off
so yeah that's good as well need for my
language
in I'll just pee now I don't like nah no
way I'd try anyway but I don't know
clean eyes well can I throw it it's
different so I have a quick chat let's
get expensive one is it is it cannot
pack of quicker I completely well plus I
keep it how to keep that yeah okay so so
this is B for thought I'm going to drive
looks really cool but I know I'm not
going to like it
because I really do have you know no
paper at all times I try a tiny teeny
teeny finder the packaging so cool I
reckon it's going to be like kind of
fudgy so quite sick yes very strong bike
badging Capshaw you know I hate peanut
butter but that wasn't actually that bad
know what I swear I think all that
really like the texture but I hate
peanut butter but that wasn't actually
that bad
I expect it to be worse although I would
never go in a shop and buy it
definitely not Alan dodo peanut butter
I'm going to give this a 5 and v 1 and v
1 are Santa divorce' Maranatha Cyril
so good welcome that's what I'm trying
there's everyone that oh oh I opened it
really nicely then all these are flowers
inside I have a feeling I'm going to
love this one
I really do it looks like we have these
things in England that look like this
and they're so so good and they're like
not hard to get hold of but not many
shops sell anymore
they're like hippos oh my goodness I've
got no maybe is justified I'm not sure
they look like this bar here let me know
in the comments below because I really
really want to know what it's going to
really annoy me and they actually
possibly one of the best chocolate I've
ever tried and I haven't had them in
years

goodness that's so cool
whoa that's so cool it has like three
circles on the squares so you get stuck

out yeah yeah we the packaging yeah I
think it is enough that is sober gonna
give this a nice ever get time to go to

so good can you say can you sing today

Kenyan butcher is it a gas outdoor
daughter that was pretty good yeah up

business a Brazilian and I'm Portuguese

absolute as again we have these over a
seminar in England like dual strips and
I think I'm going to love these these
are like light pink and they have like
sugar all around and it looks so good
yeah hmm I put on weight but trying one
is the ones that I tried now in this pot
here all the ones that I tried and this
is probably the best candy or sweet so
to say so I have ever tried in my life
like it's amazing I'm going to make sure
I get some poppers oh and ship it over
to England it's that good this light is
11 out of 10 its star so good this is
what I look like inside I've eaten way
too much with it's like it's really
funny it's like really you can tell is
so bad it's like covered in sugar it's
so sweet it's like Cara Mady finally it
is amazing if you get time to go still
please get these because these are
probably the best wheat I have ever
tried in my entire life
I'm literally kind of face so sick at
the end of this video right now and
going back to sweeties gloves these ones
too so adorable it has Mickey Mouse on
the fron
how big a dollar all the bucket has all
different color Mickey Mouse has yellow
orange blue line so like green it says
lemon so I'm guessing it's like the line
for stairs Oh every night please I think
I'm going to give these an island of RVs
so that I can eat you all along hello I
think that's how you pronounce it I want
you to try this one for quite low and
slow just because I don't know it does
like any chakra bar but I've seen in
England you like as well
my goal is amazing and then over
football for waiting
Oh
all person say oh my god oh my god
mama you're showing the best job of all
my line oh I'm destroying the best job
of my life this is crazy amazing you
need to try this after this is that this
is like way past ten out of ten this is
number I'm calling with spent inside
hello Bridget
it's like a really dark chop on a milky
way if that trough those kind of hearty
Spain with second top movies like yeah
that you see thick milk chocolate inside
and then has like oh my god it's just
for that thing I've ever tried this is
the next one this is soap it's a biscuit
and I can imagine this being with Hodge
on top and we get trying then bitty
country very hard it's like a digestive
but a bit more country and yeah these
are really good I think we need to
invest in blend or more Brazilian candy
because it's so much better than arm and
I never thought I would say that the
final chocolate bar I'm going to try it
tears and this is choc eat oh yeah you
can just tell this is like a foreign
candy it's nothing like what our offer
would be here in England so I'm really
interested Seward case I got be quite
crunchy
yeah it's crunchy I was not expecting
this
why do I like your kinda show mark that
taste so much better than it looks
it has like a funny texture in the
middle with the property bits on the
outside but not too crunchy dick
chocolate and once again it is amazing
I'm going to give this a nine and a half
because it's so good and I was right
expecting it to have at the fudging bit
in the middle it'll just be really
crunchy
that is amazing once again as you can
tell I have loved doing this right now
