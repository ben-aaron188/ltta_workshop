time I try to do this every single time
that is so it's 9:40 I woke up really
late today and it's a Friday because we
have an insect day luckily thank
goodness
so I've got extra day off to my week
that I have off so an extra day of
logging and wheatley I want to Whaley
but I forgot those working today so I
put all my makeup on before I done this
vlog because I woke up like half a and
so yeah I'm kind of ready although I'm
wearing my really ugly pj top and just a
jumper over top because it was so cold
this morning and see how I'm doing that
I woke up actually really lay also
because I went to my friend's party last
night had like a cap shop for the girls
it was actually really fun and yeah that
was really nice but now I'm so tired and
I need I've got so much to do today
I need to go to the gym I am going into
town I'm going all the way into town to
get my foundation because I have run out
which is just all for once so annoying
but obviously I need a new one so I'm
going to do that I'm filming my most
requested video that I've ever yeah my
most requested one why am I saying that
I've ever my Mo's request a video and I
haven't done this before
because it's quite a video that I feel
quite insecure about but then I think
you guys are so lovely and you wouldn't
judge me anyway so I'm just going to do
it and a lot of you guys have requested
that so I'm going to film that later and
you'll find out on Wednesday what that
is they don't tell you yet
and it's so requested anyway yeah I've
got so much to do today
so I'd currently remember what I'm doing
because I have so much to do so I have a
little checklist of what I'm doing today
so I'm going to look what I'm going to
do in a minute and as I've got so much
to do and I can barely even remember and
so yeah I need to go do that I'm going
to start off by finishing getting ready
by taking my PJ top off for starters and
get my clothes on and hopping into town
with my mom and hopefully getting a
boost on the way fingers crossed when on
the way but like on the way through into
town hopefully hopefully hopefully my
favorite thing ever
okay so I'm now ready to go to town I've
well nearly went to church tower I've
half done tidying my room and he's got
tidy a few more bits and silicified
draping on the sides and I want it to be
tidy so I need to do that this is what
I'm wearing I've now got my jumper on
and I've just got my new converse which
I love and just some ripped black jeans
on which I wear all the time I'm
obsessive ripped jeans any color I love
them so much they one of my fav things
I'll try and show you them around here
got massive me right here let's go see
okay so this is my jumper on my outfit
it's just yes sir this is it
so really plain boring outfit town but
yeah I love it
um here's my still messy room and the
bed sheets have been all taken off and
because they're going in the wash which
means tonight I get fresh bed sheets
which is the best feeling in the whole
world
always rose amazing I don't have a card
not love having fresh bread seeds like
the bed sheets
I think everyone loves fresh bread sheet
so looking forward to that and I'm now
off to town so let's go
oh my god oh my god we've just got in
the car I can't you my secret identity
alcohol yes you with fever
hello yes I've got my booze - morning
between of course and I've actually got
a new favorite now this is the
strawberry squeeze I used to get the
strawberry and cream
this was actually like a lower calorie
and it tastes actually nicer don't leave
it is what is nice Apollonia yes a
banana as well as well as strawberries
ESCA Sun casts welcome back is so yummy
and I got a lot of shopping today a lot
of new clothes and spend a lot mine
anyway wish I should before this dress
so yeah and also we was in a well we
have been in town a lot longer than we
expected to be in town because we just
got carried away like even just looking
in shop window shopping you look yeah
forgot my purse
so I'm happy to lend me the money for
the stuff but I want to quit and then we
spent ages in the bank as well trying to
stop anymore
yeah so that has been our trip to the
town so I've just finished from my video
and it's three o'clock now as we got
back a really late and I had to like set
up the lights and stuff but actually my
filming room now and it's not completely
ready at all like it's really bare it's
just plain white at the moment but this
is where I'm going to film all my videos
and I'm going to have like Lowe's stuff
up on the wall and then I can just take
them down and stuff when I want to
change my backdrop one of them home oh
my god and so yeah so I've just filmed
for that what am i doing but you know I
came in here for a reason to show you
something I can't remember anyway let's
go get some food I'm really hungry it's
really dark
nice little through my house and okay oh
this is my good eater off okay this is
my goody dog this is like goodies that I
absolutely love but they are healthier
than having like a chocolate bar sleeves
and so in here we have chocolate raisins
and little packs of chocolate raisins I
have these chocolate Y scripts of these
are my obsession
chocolate rice cakes are my favorite
things ever the so addictive and these
only have like 65 calories so there's so
much less than any chocolate bar snakey
bars I'm in love cocoa oven - so this is
it chooses a joke Lauren JH and yo-yos
these are only 30 calories as well
they're so nice then aren't you filling
though and they're more NIC applause and
to be honest I don't like this flavor
but yeah and also we have doo-doo-doo
more chocolate rice cakes so what one do
I have actually this is right I'm
thinking that but then I want to talk
the rice cake but then if I eat one I
can't not just have one so what do I do
today I might get something raises as I
need customers hello hello hello say
hello say hello look at me look at me
look at me this is my dog and she's so
cute

gonna comb messy Amalfi's it's always

no go what is it she kind of runs around
but today no I think she knows skip film
it here we go okay right so it's got the
stairs because tonight I am going out to
one of my friends gigs and he has the
most amazing voice name's Gary yeah he
has the most amazing voice so big shout
up to him I can't wait to go there
tonight and I'm going with one of my
friends a jest that I haven't seen in
ages and now become my room and I need
to decide what I'm wearing because we
are leaving really soon I have no clue
I'm gonna wear an on this oh my god this
scarf that I got today psycho really
drapey scarf so I don't really know how
to explain it to us it's not like a
scarf that we are on your neck you kind
of like have wear it all over I don't
know how to explain it this is so hard I
will show you because I think I'm going
to be wearing it tonight okay so this is
what I meant by the scar I mean it's not
really on properly as I've just like
shoved it on to show you but it does
actually have a word for what it's
called is scuse Allah that's clean
washing and you just have a word for
what it's called like it looks like a
sitting right this side but this side
yeah and he's sort of out completely but
yeah this is what I mean is I could not
really a scarf he does have a name why
how I forgot it I do not know okay so I
am nearly ready to go out laughs oh look
at my makeup oh did you pull that away
and in my bag so undecided no me so much
squatting down right now so I'm deciding
on what bag to take is if I take my
handbag they take a hammer but then it's
really big and anointing or I could take
this really amazing shoulder bags that
have but with this it doesn't look like
great because when it goes on top I
can't put my hand through it so it looks
really stupid so I'm thinking I have to
take a massive bag

light which means it's probably no right
