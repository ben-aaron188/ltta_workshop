hi everyone so today I am going to be
doing a Q&A for you guys and a lot of
you guys have been asking me if I would
do one and I thought as I haven't done
one before why not do one today that was
my phone you guys have asked me over
social media like Twitter and Instagram
that will be linked below so if you
haven't asked me anything on this Q&A
and you want to ask one another or
another video then go check out my
social media can I just say I cannot
believe it's autumn already like it's
time to get layering and have hot
chocolates and I can't believe how fast
the summer's gone yeah let me just stop
rambling and let me just get into the
video so the first question I got asked
was from a girl called grace and this is
from Twitter and she asked me if I could
be any Disney princess what would I be
now when I was younger I always always
always wore Cinderella's dress I loved
her more than any princess she was so
adorable and I don't know what it was
there's just something about her life I
think I just loved the story of
Cinderella I just loved the whole
romantic side of the story
and to be honest who doesn't want to be
living in a castle actually an
incredible castle with the prince I
think everyone does so yeah I would be
Cinderella fashioned this is from
sparkling sulk X and she asked what was
your favorite go-to drink at the moment
now my favorite go-to drink I wouldn't
say this at the moment I would say this
has always been my favorite go-to drink
from when I first discovered these drink
place and this was I don't know how long
ago it was a really really long ago but
boost boost is my favorite place to go
get a drink it's a smoothie place but
the textures of the drink are so thick
that they taste like milkshakes it away
but still really fruity like a smoothie
I can't really describe them they are
basically just amazing and my favorites
are definitely the strawberries and
cream and fruit salads so if you haven't
had a boost and you want to try one go
try them I definitely recommend them
they are amazing what is your definition
of chilling now my definition of
Chanin would be just lounging around
watching Netflix or YouTube I've never
ever when I'm at home not really never
and I said not really never like so many
times I don't know when I'm at home I'm
always watching YouTube in my
subscription box or just looking for new
youtubers - what I love like watching
tutorials and staff and I am obsessed
with watching like series on Netflix
like Pretty Little Liars and I've just
started watching American Horror Story
and it's amazing and I want to start
watching on just the news app as well so
that's some of my definitely to go list
okay so this is actually from Lily Ella
and she asked me what is your favorite
season now my whole life my favorite
season has been the summer because I
love just going out and I love going to
the beach as in Brighton we're lucky
enough to have a beach and I'm not going
down there and going to me again ice
creams and catching a tag definitely
because I'm super super pale but I don't
know what it is this year I am loving or
- even though we've only just started
autumn I think it's because I prefer
that fashion in the autumn then summer
that makes sense just because I love
like layering and I love my quaint
jumpers because they're so smugly and
the hot chocolate and when the leaves
change color is so pretty
and I don't know what it is this year
but I'm loving autumn so much so usually
it would be some of it this year I'm
thinking my favorite season was the
autumn but my birthday is in the summer
so I think that's also what has made
them that whole life but first for
summer as my birthday I love my
birthday's so much I always have so much
fun on my birthday of my friends and my
family but then my middle names altered
so you know it's a bit of both I
couldn't even choose that's haven't
really answered the question this year
I'd say - autumn but Moshi as I've
stated summer this question is from
Katie first 11 and she asked me how I
I'm just talking so much drama
Katie Firth asked me already getting
excited for Christmas and Halloween
brackets PS I Love You Pierce I love you
too and am I getting excited for
Christmas Halloween that should even be
a question I am obviously getting
excited for Christmas and Halloween I
love every event that comes up they're
always so much fun I love Christmas more
than any time of the year Christmas is
so much fun and I love giving I'm
receiving presents so much and I love
love love just spending time with my
family on Christmas it's so much fun and
when like the Christmas lights come out
I don't know it is such a festive season
I love it so much and Halloween yes I
love dressing up for Halloween - so much
and every year on Halloween we always go
to like some sort of like fright place
that always gets my adrenaline going and
I love it so much actually
oh I loved it so much but the years
before I would even Stefon amazed
because I was so scared but this year
and last year I'm loving mazes so it's
gonna be good this year
this was a tweet from Sophie krumin and
she asked me how the viewers got a fan
of names no they haven't
and we need to have find a name I want
to find a name so much just as much as
you guys do so gonna comment some
fashion names and I guess whichever one
gets the most likes will be our fandom
name yeah let's get a fan of men go come
on
something cool I don't know what because
I can't be come on myself but just go do
that so another question I got asked is
what means my favorite thing about Jake
now my favorite thing about Jake this is
so hard to say because I love absolutely
everything about Jake but one thing I
would say about Jake is he's the most
kind-hearted person that I know and he's
amazing in every single way and I
possibly couldn't choose one
well I possibly could not choose a
favorite thing about James but I do that
we smile as well as everything else I
don't know I can't choose but yeah I
love everything about it Jake my next
question is from greatest hope 212 and
she asked me can you say the alphabet
backwards right let me try
said why X no I can't
well definitely not in the time we have
to do in this video if I had it laid out
in front of me then yeah but if not no I
really very calm this is from Mia grace
ward - I feel as if everyone is asked me
questions husband named Grace in it okay
what is your favorite place to shop
now I'm gonna say the really different
places I would say if I spend most of my
money in Topshop because I love so much
things in there they have like such
partial staff and I wouldn't say it's
too expensive but it's not too cheap at
the same time it's just kind of average
price I love it I get my everyday
clothes from there all the time
thought if I'm ever going to London or
summarize that isn't Brighton and
absolutely love forever 21 it's so cheap
and it's so good like their summer
collection is amazing for starters I
always go there in the summer because
that's my favorite time when they bring
in their clothes it's old so nice and it
kind of reminds me of hate um but just
better because it's cheaper but it has
the same self better yes I love forever
also I absolutely love and as you guys
all would know and if you don't know
then I don't know how I'm obsessed with
Victoria Secrets ambach Troy Secrets
pink although it's on the pricey side it
is amazing and just the look copic Troy
secrets when you walk in the shop it
always looks incredible and so I like
the stairs in London's are all
completely mirrored like glass and
crystal and ah it's so so pretty so yeah
I have another favorite shops but they
would definitely be my top three so this
question is actually from Instagram and
this isn't from a person called Kalani
crook and she asked me if you could have
a dream house where'd you put it
by the way love you by the way that we
do my dream house is going to be in LA
I've never actually visited LA but I
know so many people that have
or absolutely loved it and the houses
there just look amazing and obviously
the shops there I think are amazing so I
would love to be surrounded by all those
shops and obviously I've seen it on TV
and like Beverly Hills it just looks
amazing so who wouldn't want to live
there I definitely want any of that I am
going to live there yes Massa asked me
how did take and I mean you should have
already seen this you should have been
on dates channel and you should have
watched the video it says there how we
met it's actually the title of the video
the video is just about how we met to be
honest it doesn't really make much sense
I can kind of understand why you're
asking but what's the video first and
then if you still don't understand then
ask again photos of people vastly more
options I took my TCC's so I chose dance
performing arts and Spanish I'm not very
good at Spanish although I wish I was
because we do go to a lot of Spanish
countries and I love them so much but
I'm not really doing that very I love
love love performing arts and dance so
I'm really really glad that I took those
options so I'm gonna end this video here
now but if you did enjoy once again
please give it a big thumbs up also if
you think this was a good video and you
enjoyed it then let me know in the
comments if I should do another one
because I've got so many questions that
I still want to ask that and I'm
guessing you guys do want me to answer
them so go go go and tell me if I should
do another video like this and I really
hope you guys enjoy the rest of the week
and I will see you very soon with
another video bye you know
get down down low cuz you're the only
one to have me going online like you
don't know
