hi guys so today I'm currently sitting
here in my school uniform and I have
just had my first day back at school and
it was so so boring but it has actually
inspired me to do this video today which
is what is in my school bag all of you
guys have requested or watching through
my bag video and I thought this one was
really really similar so I think it'd be
more enjoyable for you guys to watch as
a lot of you guys have just gone back to
school but here it is my school bag this
school bag is actually from pennies it
was 30 pounds but it was definitely
worth the money and it's really really
good quality it holds a lot of stuff in
it as my bag is so full right now and
not rating with school stuff all just
stuff that I love but I use every day so
it's really really good quality it's
definitely worth the money if you see my
other videos you'll know that I love
sneak bread and it has like the croc
print all over it so I love this bag a
lot the first thing I have in my school
bag which I think everyone who's
watching this video will hop on and
everyone would take one to school with
them and this is my phone my phone I
take everywhere with me if I left my
phone at home I think I would have to
come back home and then go back to
school because there is no way I could
go to school about my phone as you guys
may know I'm always like Instagram and
Twitter and social media so I need my
phone with me so let's see what else I
take in my bag with me water I always
take a quarter of water with me because
obviously I want to say hi draped in the
day and usually I put strawberries or
some kind of fruit in it like grapes or
Kiwi well they're like the main ones I
normally put in them them three today I
put in strawberries the strawberries are
really fresh right now as I had stopped
his pro lunch so I chopped them on the
bar and I put them in the water as I've
already had three butchers today as I'm
trying to stay really healthy and stay
hydrated all day my makeup bag now this
here is possibly as well as my phone one
of my favorite things that I always take
to school I would never
not take this to school and I would
never not take my makeup bag in any bag
like every time I go out I always always
always take my makeup bag with me
because you know in case of emergencies
like it's my Bradshaw or wherever is in
case of Mona T's I take it just in case
so it's always there so always know by
having a breakdown
or my friends having a breakdown about
their makeup that day then I can read
you it in mentor or sometime at lunch
and break just school interested my
basic makeup as I don't really wear
fancy makeup to school I just put on my
basic makeup I don't normally wear
eyeshadow and stuff so I wouldn't
normally bring that to school I just
take my basic makeup with me now as I'm
reaching into my bag I can see my two
lipsticks and these lipsticks I don't
ever take in my makeup bag I always put
them in the side pocket of my bag it's
easier to reach in the middle of the day
and as you guys may know I absolutely
love lipsticks I don't know what it is I
think it just made me feel better about
myself when I wear lipstick like I would
never ever leave the house without
wearing lipstick because I don't know it
just makes me feel like I don't know
gives him more color to my face school I
take my vomit teddy and my myth and
these are both from Mac the velvet teddy
is a dark color but when I put me over
the top it makes it a lighter color and
I think they go really really nice
together although I think if you have a
tan you won't need to get myth because
velvet teddy shows up on its own if you
have a tan just get barber teddy and if
you don't then get myth as well but I'm
just supposed to put on my bag I would
say everyone takes to school with them
especially at the start with the anyway
make it a half way through you end up
asking for a pen in the end but at first
you always take a pencil case with you
and so here I have got my really plain
simple
see-through pencil case I just I don't
know what it is I always seem to get the
same pencil case every year this same
like I think it's like three pounds WH
Smith it's just a see-through pink
pencil case I love the color pink
so obviously the pencil case is paint
and everything inside of it is pink and
I don't just have one of these I take to
school I also have another which is
somewhere in my
yeah and this one is full of felt pens
so I've got a stationary one and one
that has belt pen no wheantr WH Smith to
buy the stuff that I have inside which
are just like pink pencils surprise
surprise a pink rubber a little cute
pink pig sharp not that I love and I
like pink
retractors and rulers and stuff
everything inside of it's pink apart
from the pens itself I spent so long
trying to find pink stuff because I had
to make sure this pink it was cute the
school because I would say the pencil
case that South is really boring
yes so I spent ages and ages trying to
look for my right stationery to take to
school and at the time I was with Jake
when we went to go get my stationery and
he was getting super bored as he was
counting day 1 day 2 day 3 like day 4
and you might have seen that in his
vlogs if you watch his vlogs will see
him coming down the days for me to go
buy my stationery so ok so I did
actually think I still had this in my
bag but this is my empty port it's
actually had yogurt some fruit and
granola and it had fruit it had
strawberries raspberries and grapes and
it was super super yummy it's one of my
favorite things to eat especially
granola I absolutely love granola so
yeah that was super yummy to eat and
this is now my empty pot on my tiny
spoon that I have inside now the next
item I'm about to put up my bag I would
say every single person loves and this
is chewing gum
Oh chewing gum I'm so so so so addicted
to I don't know a person that doesn't
like chew and got my frame on this when
I go and buy chewing gum I always hit
the sugar free ones because obviously
doughnuts rock my tea I always take a
really really big pack of chewing gum to
school because you know when you get to
school and then your sneekly trying to
get the chewing gum out your bag but
then it mixes and then suddenly this
nose of people crowded around you like a
whole swarm of bees and he suddenly
gather like loads of new friends yeah
because you know they all wanted to
income to appease my
I promise okay if you went back to March
they forgot me today and you know they
never give you one back so I always make
sure I take extra bit for and just in
case you know if you like the best
friend's breath kind of smells that day
you know help a friend out give them a
chewing gum hop on yourself it's all
good
take the boot pop my school diary this
is probably the only other thing rather
than my pencil case it is actually
school related this isn't something that
I choose to take to school I have to
take this to school
it just has my timetable on the back
here and yeah we just don't we just kind
of write rubbish like our homework and
stuff my purse now my parents I always
hit to school I don't really ever take
much money in my purse because I never
really buy stuff at school I normally
take my own lunch because I'm trying to
stay healthy I normally just from my
purse in case you know I want to pop to
town after school maybe get something
there inside my purse I have it's like
my really really dirty Versailles today
I have my oh that's a train ticket you
see where this goes - oh this one
actually goes to Harvard so yeah this is
because I use this on the weekend I'm
just going to put that inside and
they'll probably be left there for like
another year or so I have my credit card
and of course I have my boost card
because actually guys may know I am
absolutely addicted to boost they're my
favorite thing they're super healthy for
you if you ever go to boost get a
strawberries and cream or a fruit salad
I really recommend them they are amazing
they taste like milk shea butter healthy
for you I always seem to take a spray
with me to school because obviously I
want to smell an eye for this phrase
actually for a bath or body words and
it's actually one of my favorite sprays
out oh you smell it super summery so if
you want to stay in the summary vibe
which is like me and I love the summer
then definitely get this spray I'm super
recommend it
okay so I actually think my back is
although Hillier now these are tie
rosettes Tyra sets are something I use
very very often and these are sore
throat sweets because I seem to get sore
throws all the time
if you ever seem to get sore throws
definitely get tie rosettes because they
work so well I have these in every
single bad that I own these are the best
things they super help they're numb your
tongue so they're funny to talk to after
as well but yeah these are super good if
you ever get explore throats definitely
get these the final fine I'm fine I'm
fine I'm fine I'm fine a puff of her
vinyl what the how did I just do I do
not know the final thing I may take to
school and I'm pretty sure none of you
guys would take these for school as well
are earphones I take these to school
because I wore to school and obviously I
liked isn't music looking to school
about music is not fun so I always take
these for walking to school and back to
school and especially at lunch and break
and when I'm walking from lesson to
lesson I always make sure I have my
earphones in because I love listening to
music and I'm sure a lot of you guys can
agree on them so I'm sadly having to end
this video here now as everything in my
school bag is completely empty I have
nothing else in my bag just before it in
this video I just wanted to say a lot of
you guys have also asked if I do what's
my makeup bag so I'm gonna make sure I
definitely do that soon so look out on
my channel and if you enjoyed this video
please give it a big thumbs up and I'll
see you soon bye
