of our baths kasi like pretty and today
we're doing the ugly photoshoot
challenge so much there isn't a winner
yet guys you lot of voting who is the
winner and basically I love this video
so much it's been like really popular on
YouTube at the moment so I thought while
I do on my channel but as you guys loved
seeing me my parents why don't you a mom
versus dad challenge so basically my
parents both took photos of me with an
iPhone in the same clothes so it was
completely fair and you guys could get
different locations so they actually
chose different locations for each other
to make it like each difficult you know
and what more did you choose for dad I
chose the dads to photograph you in a
cemetery and a major story car park it
was hard but we got Authority do me dad
you know what we'd pick the best cemetry
we did so beautiful yeah because I'm
converters I think dad what did you
choose for mum I chose for a skip faster
and they were hard very hard so I really
hope you guys do enjoy the video it make

definitely not the prettiest that's all
the marine oh it's very pretty but the
bad part out visit
Wow I mean these rooftop ones okay I
guess yeah you've got a nice issue you
yeah we stood over there that could kind
of be cool last place that we both
decided upon it from here huh so like
basically where both cars come down this
is not what you can also but I do
because I don't want to take too much
control I don't want it to be like on
fire let's move out like oh cars coming
down
in here that's what makes one here this
one here no I don't want either nice at
all
so that starts a challenge complete I
think we did Duke for dad did you girls

he takes our dads great ID is a skip
which to be honest is the ugliest thing
ever a big this is the as well don't
push me

at the graveyard now I don't actually be
very loud but it's actually a really
nice Cemetery
yes actually so so so pretty so what my
mom doesn't know is we actually have one
around the corner and it's so pretty
they have a beautiful church those are
flowers around it so then we can
actually get a good picture obviously
I'm not doing anything on the
gravestones because that's so
disrespectful and I'm never going to do
that but it's only because I had a
school trip here like I came to this
graveyard hasn't looked around the
graveyard I'm like that was off
something really strange anyways let's
start taking the photos you ready let's
do it do it I just hope we can do it
