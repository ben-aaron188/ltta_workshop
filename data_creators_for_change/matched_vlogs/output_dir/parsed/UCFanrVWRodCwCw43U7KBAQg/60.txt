hey everyone so it's that time of year
again I cannot believe how quickly is
come around it is prom season now I'm
actually like a little belt set because
I don't have prom anymore and I loved
prom so much and my favorite part about
prom was choosing my dress I find it so
exciting however it was so hard to find
a dress so I thought this video would
help a lot of you guys out that
struggling to find dresses so I've
ordered a bunch of different dresses
very cheap affordable dresses from the
store
which I've got a couple of actually No
yeah I've done a couple of videos from
which before you guys really enjoyed
them so I thought why not try it their
prom it dresses out now I have no idea
what they're gonna be like because they
are that well they are very cheap to be
honest like if you go to any high street
store they're gonna be a lot more
expensive than there was on the website
wish these dresses look amazing online
especially for $20 however as we know
from parts of videos and past
experiences of myself trying on dresses
from sites like theirs they don't always
deny the picture however as always I
want to be as positive as I can be there
are only $20 so hopefully they do look
good obviously I'm gonna try them on for
you guys and let you guys decide on what
you think are they worth the $20 or are
they not some of them were a little bit
cheaper and $20 as well but I think that
was like the highest the highest point
let me know down below if you guys have
prom this year or if you're excited for
prom or your favorite thing about prom
when you went I also do have the void
can channel you should go check that out
that's linked down below and final thing
before we get into this video
there's a spell button that you guys
should click so you get notified every
single time they upload a new video go
and do it because my videos are never
going to subscription boxes anymore so
make sure you hit that button I hope you
guys enjoy and let's get into the video
let's start with this one the
considering is behind me
this one literally looked like stunning
online so this is a fishtail dress it's
like strapless
it looks really super flattering but
this fish's good sign so far as
impression
as I take it out of the bag Oh actually
looks so pretty these this actually
looks like really similar to the picture
I'm actually really surprised such a
quite nice as well it has like a tiny
bit of padding like we're not have to be
like padding but it has a broad cup you
know what I actually I wanted to keep my
positive on this anyways but I'm
actually so surprised the only thing is
it might not be as flattering as a more
expensive dress also there's this bow at
the back like this I thought was gonna
be like a really kind of thin cheap like
lacy crossover at the back but actually
it's like really thick it looks like
quite good material and then here is the
fish tail at the bottom any downside of
this is I think I definitely ordered a
too big of a size this the size medium
and I think I should have probably got a
size small but this dress is actually
gorgeous genuinely looks exactly like
the picture however it's a little bit
too big for me so it kind of makes me to
double the size I actually am if this is
a small I could actually pull the
strings tighter and feel a lot more
flattering on my body but it's a bit big
so I think is falling down all the time
and so like that so bye guys sides down
like I would a hundred percent give this
a 10 out of 10 the back hair is pulled
so tight I couldn't go any tighter but
you can see it's kind of baggy around
here actually don't remember ordering
them for the picture it's just like
eating it's obviously like the pattern
of it it looks cheap this was only six
dollars so I think that was one of the
reason why I was like okay seriously
what I like try this dress yeah you
can't complain is six dollars but I'd
rather save for six dollars then go out
in this dress it just doesn't really
quite look the same in real life like I
don't know how do you love the color the
color is so pretty however this bear and
this is just kind of like so
old-fashioned
it's like will you imagine in your Nan's
wallpaper to that like you know I
personally wouldn't go out on this
however for six dollars I have seen
worse I do like the style of the dress
like I love a hole to net so that's
actually like one of my favorite dresses
also that backless which is like super
pretty in real life it looks really
cheap it doesn't quite like the picture
the picture to me looks more like
beading and it
it's really pretty again we'll try on it
my lip better everything about this
dress we're making plenty honest I don't
like I just think it's really
unflattering
it's very gratified and I would not wear
this it stripping as well it's that
really too big for me like this top part
is the most unflattering thing I've ever
seen
Jenny we feel bad put this on the
internet so if you haven't heard you
find it funny mommy or not you're not
putting this on the Internet
this just doesn't laugh to me very well
this is I remember so clearly because
isn't actually my favorite online I just
love the color black dude I've got so
boring I love this this is the top it's
so cute I had love that has this bralla
underneath as well this is the skirt
that goes with it
it's a bit weird material or my life to
be fair and it looks I'm really sure
well not really shocked but I'm 5 foot 2
jaw so there's the look really super
long but I've just got a bomb big heels
I guess this looks like the picture the
only thing is the material it doesn't
look too great of it doesn't look
expensive but it was only ten dollars
like I'm definitely not complaining
about this like I do actually really
like this so I'm actually quite excited
to get this one I go and try it on so
here is the dress I asked you really
like this dress you know what it's
better than I thought it was gonna be
however I do you thought I'm going a
little bit more towards the funeral vibe
than a prom it's not really my dress I
thought it was gonna be burying me and I
do love the color black but I maybe feel
like this is just a little bit too much
however this is your style if you like
and you know more like gothic II dresses
then this is the one for you guys for
the money I feel like this is actually
really really really good obviously as I
said I would get it in a different color
but most of well is from the color that
I felt like light I wouldn't feel like
this woman good enough for prom this is
my final dress make sure you guys are
writing in the comments your favorite
dress so far okay
is another two-piece I was thinking of
us a dress but the other dress I applaud
just hasn't actually arrived
I ordered it a long time ago so this is
the top which is like really pretty this
is a really top that I would just go out
and buy but if you did like tops like
this so you pay probably $5 at the top
of lives so you get a skirt free this
guy is not me I feel like I'm gonna look
like a clown in this but some people
will look amazing in this it's a little
bit kind of fucking wet need there's a
lot of different layers like it is
really pretty to be honest this does
look like the picture again the material
is there going to be the most amazing
material of fabric in the world but you
can't expect that when you're paying
five dollars for a dress I just feel
like this isn't gonna look great on me
again we'll give it a go we'll try it on
this is the dress that I hate it off but
you know what I actually really really
really like this I actually think it's
stunning however I'm not sure if you can
see on the camera we realize you can see
I'm wearing pink knickers right now
because it is so see-through also I
can't lift my arms because if I do fall
just thank you you guys could be flashed
seriously like they need some elastic
underneath this because it's so short my
boobs are like hanging out to move the
arms yeah I actually love this I think
it's so nice I wish the quality was
better so I can actually wear it
somewhere but the quality is to see
through so you can whether that was my
wish of prom dress of video and I really
hope you guys did enjoy it I was
actually so surprised three or four of
them I actually really liked which I was
actually quite surprised by let me know
down in the comments your favorite dress
out of all the four that I did trial as
I've actually really intrigued to know
your thoughts and before we hit this
video I've actually got a giveaway soon
that I'm gonna probably be doing over my
vlogging channel and what I'm actually
gonna be giving away at my prom dress
here is a picture of me my prom dress

prom dress did cost me a lot more than
$20 so I wanted to keep it
