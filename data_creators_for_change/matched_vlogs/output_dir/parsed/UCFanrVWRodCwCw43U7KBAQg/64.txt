it clinicals are you just getting ready
with your mates and staff just super
chat so I haven't seen anyone do this no
I can't dragged into it eyes yeah I know
be cool because normally I've been
seeing people do this but like with
their mates and stuff and I thought I'd
be caught in my mom because it's like
different age do you know I mean only
two generation or experience boats
Liberians
and also I feel like a lot of you might
be interested because I feel like we
share quite a lot I'm quite open with my
mom like we tell each other quite a lot
when it comes to boys and surfing not
not everything nearly everything cut but
not everything I want to know everybody
likes to know some things you just have
to keep to yourself
yes but now I think you do no more than
a you don't normal average mum would do
you think I don't know I quite like that
right clothes
we're very close yeah but if I was to I
don't know maybe we'll talk about this
more we get into the video but if I were
to like a guy or something she'll be the
first person to know will you
yeah and judge and judge anyway

video even if it doesn't help you out I
hope here I hope you just enjoy pretty
much such a big thumbs up and subscribe
down below if you guys haven't already
and just one last thing before we do get
into the video
I do have a daily vlog in channel and so
if you want to see more of myself on my
mom then you can go let everyone else
and family then if you can also go
followed that I'll leave it on the
screen and it also be linked up below
but let's get into the video so
basically I tweeted st. weekly questions
for a boy girl talk video with my mama
so there were so many questions what's
this one what's the maximum age an 18
year old girl should date I don't feel
like there's a particular answer
look I'm one of those people I feel like
age isn't a number because age is just a
number
age 18 you are funny yeah you old pretty
much I think you could date whoever you
want me if you came home there's 60 or a
boyfriend I might be a bit I yeah but I
would still be lutely that would be that
would be really strange it would be
really no you would not yeah no agreed
okay so in the summers by birth time
could be 18 and you think a wife come on
six no we don't I know you wouldn't I
know but if I did yeah without I mean if
there's someone like in their thirties I
mean I still you know I just I wouldn't
choose that for you know you can't help
people yeah you can't help so yes
gracious that's what I'm saying I mean I
mean wouldn't go out my sister yo but
I'm just if you really did and you were
really enough of them then maybe let's
scrape it a little bit love with but
yeah we don't think there is really an
eight no not a fiver for like younger
than 18 but for me personality was gonna
judge me for this but I wouldn't want to
really date somebody my age cuz I feel
like I put I'm into guys so I feel like
guys personally have like a younger more
mature yeah but I know that as well as
actually like scientific areas and their
minions as mature as good levels out
when you get to like 80 yeah obviously
it's for not liking every single person
but the majority of my cialis day older
boy is yes rather date like an older guy
and I've
like if I did a lot of you guys to have
a lot of things to say about it but for
me past
I think that's why I've always been like
oh age isn't really a number because it
just kind of depends who you fall in
love with and just what happens that's
our answer
hey I don't not put a number on love no
there you go
would you ever date a boy that your mum
didn't like I actually feel like a lot
of you what you know won't be expecting
the answer but no only because I feel
like if my mum did it like in there must
be a strong valid reason I'm a nice
person
yeah like someone there's a reason care
about yeah no I don't think I would
because also I respect my mom's opinion
to mastership as well like if you was in
a relationship there's something
happened for me not to like and then it
would be harder for you to go I'm not
happy with you now worse if it was a
beginning of relationship and then I was
like why don't like him because whatever
then you take that you take your money
okay maybe that maybe he's not for me or
whatever so it's different it depends on
the circles yeah I think it's exactly
what you've just said like if I was in a
relationship it would be different but
if I was just going into a relationship
or my mum didn't like him they'd have to
be a strong valid reason and trust me
she makes her point so clear that I
wouldn't forget about this reason so I'm
telling you now it don't go be possible
to so the answer would be no ha okay I
actually love this one
but like this is a really good question
and you might have been waiting for this
how would Wendy feel when your boyfriend
sleeps over and if she didn't agree with
this what would you say to her love you
buyers love you too I feel like this is
a good question about if I had a
boyfriend and just in general them
sleeping over and everything else well I
mean you're nearly 18 aren't you yeah I
can't be no really I I would hope that
you've been seeing it for quite a while
before he asleep so yeah but if I had if
I just liked guys there is no way on
this planet you would let me go and see
Paloma knowing that absolutely not the
my roof
no I would haven't been making them for
like a good time I mention that her
ex-boyfriend used to say over but as Li
as you lived a million miles away
normally that would have never have
happened it would have been if you lived
in our area
then obviously there's no need because
you can just go home yeah it's just
normal so yeah so it's that I do also
feel like sometimes when parents
restrict their kids from my their
boyfriends or girlfriends whatever
sleeping over then I just think it
becomes such I don't know it doesn't
need to be as as in a big thing should I
mean so the interface we love someone I
feel like sometimes you just want to be
with them all the time and it's not
exciting only it's not like home uh
parents point of view it's okay what
don't just jump into conclusions what
could happen but for me when I first had
my first well one of my first boyfriends
and they slept over it wasn't for that
reason it was just because I just wanted
to be with them and could you love them
so much
but from a parent kind of usually
permanent it's like you just drop to
conclusions and I know when I have kids
I'll be like no they can't just sleep
over I think I'd like to give that life
like see seen them for a while first
because I'm not one of them people like
chasing up did it you got had like one
girl for next week say there's another
one what is that no no no I might ask
well you didn't up their numbers on that
anyway so how do you stop yourself from
feeling nervous on a first date you
don't you've had more experience you
don't feel enough you should come you're
gonna feel nervous and there's normal
and natural to feel nervous I think if
you didn't feel nervous and you're
really not very excited about going are
you
I think you just have to remember that
the person you're meeting is probably
feeling exactly the same as you are and
what you just think what's the worst
that can happen like what is the worst
thing that can happen like you might
drop food down your top you might rip
over but actually that probably be quite
funny so and at the end of the day if
that did happen you don't have to ever
see this exact site again exactly so
sorry you will be nervous there's
nothing you can do about it but they
feel the same so you just have to go
with the flow just think to yourself I'm
gonna be confident I'm gonna be me and I
think that's what it is I feel like
sometimes when I've gone on dates before
I thought I've got really really really
nervous because like I don't know they
might be expecting something different
who I actually am I'm quite weird and
I'm quite a bit of a freaking air in the
house but then I'd be actually being
myself is who I am and at the end of the
day if just if I if you be yourself like
you become more comfortable as well yeah
you know I mean you open up a little bit
more yeah I think so yeah yeah I think
everybody has
so they're gonna have nerves at the end
of the day and they kind of feel cute
because they're like butterfly nose yeah
oh I wish I have them again oh boy
what is the best trait a boy should have
in your opinion yeah well mom you've met
dad
so what's he got Oh God Oh funny but
darling really isn't funny babies are
cute you know when I was thinking funny
is it amazing
it's Q yeah he was funny when you met
him right no not really it's quite
good-looking them okay no I think funny
to be funny and light and light just
easygoing
it's familiar yeah I do too and I like a
nice thing it doesn't necessarily have
to mean model looks it's just someone
that you're attracted to and in a way
that you find but I think that comes to
your personality because I can look
logic and the fairly comparison the
world and then I get so then I think oh
actually I do we don't find you very
attractive because their personality is
just not so they kind of do you not many
works the other way you can actually
think oh they're not very good-looking
but when you get to know them they
suddenly become like a supermodel to you
because actually their personality
shines through their looks oh yeah a
hundred yes it's so much more important
I think just be nice and kind and funny
definitely they make you laugh yeah a
hundred there but also romantic all
right but you can't make lifelong no no
I don't think you can come here you've
got to train them well but they've got
to start from somewhere yeah if they
don't like open the door feel ease but
for me I feel like I'm the pickiest
person on I yes with me this is what
happens basically go to go basically all
I could be really into someone I'm like
in love with them and then as soon as
they like me back I'm like no yeah a
little bit little bit I'm 15 currently
in a relationship with my boyfriend of
six months I feel as though he's falling
out of love with me and beginning to
realize that he could do better when I'm
around this house ignores me for his
xbox and five other girls what do I do
get the hell out yes girl firstly he
probably can't do better you just feel
like that like I'm sure there's nothing
wrong with you and that's not the case
at all but if he's ignoring you and he's
talked to other girls and stuff
yeah not him yeah exactly that's it like
you deserve better at the end of the day
the first two three months when you're
not with him might be really or for
whatever else and you might be really
sad and alone but the thing is it's
gonna be so much better in the long run
because you're obviously not happy at
the moment anyway so you don't want to
be with him you need to leave I think
the best thing to do is to try and get
over a relationship is obviously you
need to get away from him
and I think just like going out with
friends or even your family I don't know
whether psych your best company just go
out with them and just like Spencer my
good good good quality time I think it's
good to like fancy other people and to
start liking other people yeah but
definitely don't go rush into another
relationship because it literally just
doesn't help don't learn to love
yourself more that's if you're gonna do
that so um mom love yourself and then
you'll find out baby
when did when did lose her virginity I
was gonna say so don't take that
seriously oh my god what's your biggest
advice to try and gain a boyfriend
someone you want expert this I think you
should have I am I'm so good at this so
don't do with me I don't vote on the
best I know I could give advice but I'm
not I don't actually have a boyfriend so
no you go I'm lonely sometimes though we
have a boyfriend but you're not looking
for a boyfriend you know no I'm not
looking for a way forever I always
wanted my friend just hoping it's gonna
happen I just hope it's just gonna walk
into like the man of my dreams is what I
just want to happen to me yeah
thankfully goodbye big don't look too
hard for boyfriend yes yes always when
you're least expecting air and when you
like yeah when you're least expecting it
and also when you don't want to
boyfriend because I feel like at the
moment among
what a boyfriend I want a boyfriend
that's why I'm not gonna get one but
then when I'm not looking for one
they're just gonna pop without their
they call me madam go dry you shiny
horse is that connect you up yeah
oh I like this one can girls ask boys
out to all wait for the boy to ask yes I
can yeah I think they cannot honey bunny
first tree I know you oh yeah
no I think so I'm past I don't know if I
would I don't know buddy
confident stay oh man I got a boy thing
then that's justice
yes no shouldn't no I don't think I
don't you in a hundred percent but Toby
in 100 I don't know if I would be
confident enough I would say I'm quite
confident person you've asked people out
you said I what about food drink oh yeah
I also like to go out but I don't know
if I'd actually ask them to be sure it's
somebody I don't understand how you've
what you called it dating and I think
because I was going to say that this was
Manteca Mesa this person II what I like
him you want a guy who would want to ask
me personally but I definitely don't
think girls shouldn't ask I think it
should be a 50/50 thing I hundred
percent yeah whatever suits your
personality yeah yeah go for it they say
here's a really good well this is really
interesting and this is this makes me
sad because I just felt bad this person
but this is our 15 and I'm gay and I
haven't told anybody yet what can I do
that's really yeah it's a really big
thing personally if you were gay at 15
and you told me it wouldn't make any
difference to me at all no like it's
fine and you'll probably be surprised
because your parents might already know
like I'll have suspicions so there might
not be as shocked as you think but if
you're really really scared to tell them
maybe you could tell like a family
member and email just try and tell
somebody because opening up about it
obviously is a lot less stressful and
kind of gets a bit of a weight off your
chest so then it's easier to therefore
tell your parents because you're
hopefully they would have good reactions
about it so if you don't think we told a
friend or a cousin like that but if you
haven't see their reaction because that
might surprise you you might think Boop
it was gonna freak out I think it'll
stain age do you know most people don't
care doesn't matter it's not a big deal
but obviously some people are really
old-fashioned and kind of or religious
or whatever and can't get our heads
around this so it it is hard it's really
hard but I think you're I think you'll
you'll be surprised at the reaction you
get I think you should just you know
when when you feel the time quite just
tell them just just just say it and can
I just say this I feel really strongly
about this I hate the fact that if
you're gay you even have to tell people
yeah and then you have to come out I
know you've obviously you know I mean
yeah I just hate the fact that is the
thing I really hope that one day isn't
but well it is yeah
the advice that we give obviously their
side and there's more people you could
speak to them yeah there's loads of
other people you could speak to yeah me
I just think you'll be surprised that
people's reaction when you tell them I
don't think they're gonna be as shocked
as you might think they are and I think
nobody understands I mean even if
they're not you know like straight away
then get them around yeah they love it
they're calm down don't say is that at
some point you're gonna have to tell
them so if it's upsetting you mowing you
sooner rather than later is probably
better just so you feel like it's like a
chance maybe write them a note maybe
write a note a letter and explain it so
you feel ready nervous and you know how
to tell them and then they can kind of
digest it and then you can talk about
after I know it be any anger or you know
why don't we go through the emotional
stuff like goes yes still you on a
spiritual level the boys probably do
yeah no obviously boys do but I swear
they don't shove it Gardena week we have
carriers and everything in our home we
have more emotions which isn't
necessarily a bad we don't have more
emotions we're just there more all know
by now yeah yeah so I don't know I only
said I asked the same thing that you
asked it's really annoying but I think
boys feel is actually the same they just
don't they say they don't show it as
much yes a hundred
won't do this streak where they just
hide their I guess hide it that boys
yeah
how should I feel if my ex goes out with
my friend you should feel betrayed
not while you're eggs by your friend by
your friend because I get that can I
quickly just things you can do but this
is where I'm gonna bran because this
annoys me so much right obviously your
ex whatever they should be respectful
and I know if if I broke up with my ex
and we weren't together just because he
fell out of love or whatever and it was
just it just happened to be nothing
major bad had happened obviously it'd be
really awful for them to go and then
date a friend but it's even worse on
your friend because they're supposed to
be your friend to them and I never
understand why the boyfriend the
boyfriend yeah the one who gets having a
go at the ex-boyfriend yeah cuz it
should be your friend yeah cuz they're
clearly not your friend because I know I
would never do that to my friend and
every single one of my friends would
never in a million years even dream
doing that to me and if they did they
wouldn't be a friend to me she's a
master and I feel quite strongly about
language they always always sorry I
always say it is so annoying
yeah Calum you break up with your ex
he's your ex oh he doesn't have any
loyalty to you anymore so it doesn't
matter your friend is still your friends
so she should still be like Bing
flipping song
yes mum you do that how I thought it a
lot quicker that I down what age is it
too young to have a baby
oh I don't think again like ideally I'd
like you to wait using your 20s
do you have a baby because I just think
you know you need to live a little
before you settle down have a baby it's
a massive commitment I wouldn't want you
to have a child that young but sometimes
it just happens like that and I wouldn't
knock anyone for going through that I
think it's a massive thing for someone
that young but she got married every
category now I would go
so you've been in such power and
everything else but it does happen and
you have to deal with it and there's
been under though I've got that like I
know a lot of people that have had kids
really really young like 15 16 and they
just get all of it you just get on with
it it's not ideal wouldn't recommend it
I think you should live your life more
you know but yeah pasty in a car were
only Stafford's brother she's 18
yes she's like young but they like they
live together them you're happy they've
got a family so you know it's right for
them so I think it really but there's no
age I mean ideally over 16 would be
better but you know I think ideally in
your twenties depends you know and I
agree I think it always get it depends
who you are as well it depends what
situation yellow on your situation
support yeah it's easier to do when
you're younger if you have a lot of
support and you're in a good situation
isn't it
yeah then to do it and if your butt for
me pass you know why am I asking about
me but I wouldn't have a kid of that age
I would want to wait in time I would you
just because I want to manage it with my
life wouldn't have a child what age well
I reckon it'll be probably young for
people I would probably say 24 you see
you don't think I think a lot of people
within that jump for me that's old
because most people that I know or we
very like your friends are really young
when they had kids
yeah when you've had Casey who's my
older brother my mum was really young
they were 17 Emilia had her oh my
goodness no way yes I think that's quite
old but then you enjoyed the mascot but
imagine you having a kid in 19 years I
think nowadays 19 yeah no anyway because
you're not in a relationship you would
have been a yes okay
I really don't like that to happen
because it would be nice if you was
interested but again that doesn't I
can't either so yeah yeah it's yes so
then it wasn't I've always said they
said I wouldn't want to be an old mum to
my kids so I wanna I think nowadays like
people who have kids in that like in
their mid-forties and some people have
number 17 and neither either you could
say a better parents or anything else
it's just yeah that I wonder percent
again it doesn't matter how old you are
it makes a bit for it isn't yeah yeah
it's like what life throws at you isn't
it and you just get over there so
everyone that is the end of the video I
really hope you guys did enjoy I hope
