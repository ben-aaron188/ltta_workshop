hello everyone and welcome back to my
channel I hope you guys are having a fab
day so just before we get into this
video I just want to clarify my brows
are obviously not normally this color I
just had them tinted and I really wanted
to do this video so kind of planned on
doing this video so it probably isn't
the best time to no makeup video but
here we are sewing it for you guys right
now I just quickly want to say they fade
so quickly so that's why they are so
dark I think it kind of would be alright
if I have makeup on but coz I'll make
their face as well it looks just even
worse so please just excuse my eyebrows
but anyways for today's video I am gonna
be testing wish makeup under 1 pound so
this stuff really does look like amazing
online so I'm pretty excited too haven't
really open to anything yeah I've kind
of had like a little sneak peeks but
I've tried not to because I've been
waiting for this video so I really hope
you guys do enjoy it if you do then you
know what to do smash a big thumbs up
and be sure to subscribe down below if
you guys haven't already and one last
thing before we get into this video I've
got back at my daily vlog in so be sure
to go and subscribe to my blog in
channel I also link that down below but
without further ado let's get into the
video so we are gonna start the
foundation look up my pillows falling my
very own pillow this will be obviously
I'm gonna start a foundation as I said
this is like this is a testing video so
it's not gonna be ugly to Tory or
anything so we're just gonna go for it
oh quickly actually before we do that I
have to to get brushes now I thought
this is gonna be a full size brush set
but this is the size of it now I'm not
complaining because obviously it's a
pound which i think is amazing and like
you can't get a brush set for a pound
anywhere can you I mean another I've
ever seen before personally but I mean
this is kind of it like it's just come
out of a cracker if I can find the
picture of this I'm gonna leave it here
I was not expecting this what I opened
this up so this is one of the things I'm
a little bit disappointed with but as I
said I can't really complain about it
I'm gonna try and use these brushes I've
only really got one branch like it
actively like you so good under what I'm
greed for foundation however I did also
get some sponges I don't think this is
really gonna be absorbed burn as like a
normal beauty blender or as like bouncy
but I mean these do look okay honestly
like these look like I just won the
super drug so hopefully they are good so
I think I'm going to try actually
applying with my foundation with this so
I'll come back with anything this people
thank you for using my teeth my none if
she's watching right now I know she'll
be shutting down the camera like saffron
don't you touch me my fish
they smell fishy and I have to apply
this to my face that's kind of gross so
this is what the foundation came in they
all came in like a little white bags
so this is a foundation I can't actually
tell you what it's called because as a
stick on right over it but let's have a
look I got the shade F f o 2 and this is
in pop feel so hopefully it's the color
I'm really bad picking colors it looks
don't reduce it properly quite a good
color match oh okay so it's by pop fill
so that's the brand that is by I'm not
sure if you can get this anywhere else
but it is called a flawless finish
foundation so hopefully it does exactly
that I actually have no idea what oh no
I still have no idea what shade I am
right so I'm gonna start by using the
Beauty while our version of the Beauty
Blender and stop okay it's definitely a
little bit lighter than what I would
normally use so I don't actually get
bread that often but I feel like my skin
throw bread today and this is definitely
covering up the redness however I
definitely wouldn't say it's full
coverage and me personally I do love a
full coverage foundation however if you
like something a little bit lighter then
this is kind of doing the job
so this saves everybody I have applied
three layers of this foundation to try
and thicken it up and it's still not
very high coverage but it's quite low E
which is kind of nice so as I said like
it would be it would be nicer for the
summer I definitely puff for myself I
wouldn't wear this in the winter
I think if maybe you were starting out
makeup then this foundation might be
suitable for you because it's not too
in-your-face and it's quite subtle
the only I would say about this is the
directions are in English however the
ingredients aren't and I can't speak any
other languages so I actually don't
understand it so if you guys do get the
foundation then be aware of that because
we actually have no idea what's inside
that bottle right I think I'm just gonna
go over with one more layer just try and
get that full coverage cuz we are like
that I love the full coverage and then
we might just leave
I've gone I've gone over the brows after
they've been tinted that's not good oh
no this this sponge is just not helping
that's the thing that you fund the
foundation is quite nice but it's just a
sponge I generally feel like I've just
got a pebble off the beach and I put it
on foundation with it like this is rock
solid
I don't know I've been kidding like it
just it just doesn't bounce it just
doesn't really give anything it's just
it's just soaking up the foundation on
its name but the foundation I'm actually
really feeling it think you actually
looks quite nice I like it so before we
do move on quickly do you just want to
say that I am feeling this my nation I
would probably give us the thumbs up
however I have applied like four or five
layers and now I'm not sure how long
it's gonna last
so hopefully towards the end of this
video but i'll update you guys on a my
blogs so we're gonna move on what we got
we've got loads of different products
that's not it turn loose powder you
don't get a I must've Gaga concealer
right so concealer we have got this
smooth Taoiseach matte
flawless finish although my wearing
concealer this is apparently going to do
a heck of a lot so this is by face
so the packagin were minute accidents
okay it's literally like a mini
foundation bottle with what this looks
like like this is actually really cool
but it definitely is darker than my
foundation so this in the shade over
three it is quite dark so just to let
you guys know so I'm just gonna apply
this very normally word which is
underneath oh this is so much darker
this is pretty annoying because I know I
can't judge it on the shade because
obviously this is my fault if the
foundation was this color I feel like it
would be amazing this is really nice
though but this is actually like a
really good concealer considering this
is a pound is a really nice coverage
like it's quite thick but like not too
thick oh wow I actually think that is so
nice genuinely false guys just notice
look got foundation on my lips anyways
so yes bronzer I'm gonna go in with
brush the one brush there's actually
thick enough to use but it definitely
isn't a contour brush out my bang impact
it right so I'm gonna try and put this
onto the brush honestly it's not really
doing much like it's not ready I'm
sticking onto the brush very well maybe
it's a control thing like I said think
I'm gonna give it a go with the brush I
put quite a lot all the brush however it
doesn't look like it and if it doesn't
if it doesn't really do anything then
we're just gonna be up the side we're
just gonna roll it on okay so let's
start with the left cheek and let's get
applying yeah everybody thought this too
much okay look oh my god a little bit we
got a little bit of piglet right I think
nothing's happening we're just gonna
have to go for it now might be quite
nervous to do this but like he's just
gonna completely risk the whole makeup
okay we're just gonna go right we're
just gonna roll it on don't think it
actually rolls but then we're just gonna
wipe on okay right here we go here we go
definitely not too bad this is not too
dark so now I'm thinking once you blend
it in yeah so this is this is the way to
do it I'm thinking
the actual product itself is actually
quite nice however this brush is
literally like using a feather so far
I'm doing pretty well considering
I practically use a pebble and a feather
to apply my makeup there is the finished
look to be honest I feel like I'm kind
of blaming the brush rather than the
bronzer because I follow the bronzer
itself it's actually really pretty and
if I give you actually have I could do
some brush that was actually oh well
just after usin the bronzer would
actually look really really really nice
because I really do like that kind of
like sunkissed kind of glow and I feel
like it could kind of give off that vibe
but it's just really hard when you have
a brush like this so let's move on
I oh okay right let's let's talk about
this this online looks like a full-size
pallet so I'm online and I'm a did this
to my basket and I'm like oh my goodness
I'm gonna get a full-size makeup palette
for one pound so that's a twelve
it's the twelve or sixteen twelve or
sixteen different chains I thought if
this is the gym this is gonna be
unbelievable okay this is the pallet
it's smaller than my face which is okay
again like I'm not gonna complain
because it's only a pound which is so
affordable and that's fine like I would
probably buy this for a pound anyways
because it is super cute and it does
look really nice it's just because like
you know when you're expecting a full
sized pallet and online this is the
photo I thought it was gonna be like
this like really big palette and it was
in so it was a little bit disappointed
but it's okay it's also like creamy
shadows as well I can't actually get
right now so really long so the company
that should get my finger in that but
they are cream rather than powder so
filler that's gonna be very difficult
front my shadow also gonna use a lot of
children brush okay I don't even know
what to use the shades are really nice
though like this is powered up this is
such a pretty palak just kind of got the
paps tools you got the darker shades I
think I'm just gonna I don't really know
what to use cuz I don't know you're just
gonna use a brown I know it's a kid I
used to have these brushes I don't know
what they're called now there must be
cause very different
but it all they are anyways right listen
this is cream how am I gonna do this
I've never used cream as an eyeshadow
before I didn't even know that was the
thing means actually going onto my skin
quite nicely this is really hard so
commonly blend with this for like I'm
just like stroking it onto my eye rather
than actually buffing it in my brows is
so dark I literally cannot I promise you
guys they're not going to say this color
okay right so we're gonna put the darker
brown in the crease see what it would
look like and you can give it to it
because I actually think it's alright I
mean it is really hard but again it's
partly to blame because the brushes not
I can't but I don't think anybody could
blend this in any better more me in the
properly cook but it's just really hard
to blend because you can't buff anything
it's just like rubbing oh this is new
makeup look so far overall I'm actually
liking this because if I'm looking at
myself towards the beginning of the
video and now I definitely do you think
I look better so now that's a good thing
alright so obviously I have polished
extensions because I'm going on holidays
for can't stick on falsies so I do just
want to show you the falsies that I
bought because these actually look like
really really really lovely a pound what
the hair but there are five sets in here
as well which is another really great
thing so obviously you can't get palaces
for somewhere else but technically these
are like 20p how good is that I'm only
gonna take one out I think the top ones
are actually my fav I would actually
wear these are my be kidding that's so
nice I mean they're a little bit plastic
Hebert well they're not no like they are
they're not gonna be like really really
really fluffy but they're they're really
lovely I think they look fluffy though
even though they are so full highlight I
got this no I just wanted to get this
because the name just like drew my
attention so this is called a unicorn
tears this is like highlight drops I
believe yet oh it's quite thick Lily
yeah it's not quite like the iconic ones
I mean it doesn't look in it I mean to
us it's not squeezing anymore it just
looks kind of thick but this is really
pretty
everything is as well on online again it
did look more like a Goldy kind of color
so I expected it to be more suitable to
my skin shade but it's white so much I
have this gonna look but let's give it a
going because it does look really really
really pretty oh that's actually so nice
however it is white if this was on why
it's a piece I mean this is so pretty
too fair actually it's not as shimmery
as I thought originally was a minute is
a pound at first I was like oh yeah this
is so great that I was just picking it
up and then I've literally like let it
sit on my face I know you can't really
see it and I thought I'd go back to your
waist of the pant because I wouldn't buy
this personally yeah actually I'm gonna
give that one a thumbs down because you
can't really see much highlight going on
all right so miss cameras why aren't you
dressed for eyeliner fast because I can
actually apply eyeliner I can't apply
let's Kara because I got this action
while I can't cut my bottom lashes so
this is where the liner looks like I
actually bought this because I like
packaged in so yeah
wait more so but wait I swear it must
have that having on once that this might
just IV this is a term one yes Oh
laying like game we've got two liners
we've got this one which is like the
perfect shape liner for me some
absolutely buzzing it looks jet-black
first thoughts this is the winning
product we've also got oh actually I
think it's just not okay it's just yeah
maybe not the winner I'm it's just
broken half but it doesn't matter
because it's a term one and I'm gonna
use this side anyways bro this could be
so hard on camera in fact is really hard
to see if these lashes as well
I mean this isn't the best eyeliner I've
done let's be honest but I think because
the brush is really hard so like it
doesn't bend at all doesn't really give
okay that was kind of it the best I can
do with why I've got however I don't
actually think this is that bad honestly
obviously you can't get bellos eyeliners
it depends how much you want to spend
the cover look at its the scuff oh I
like that's very unique different shape
always literally a car you're a cat
person it's the one I'm actually not I
do love cats but I'm a dog person let me
know if you're a cat a dog person so the
wand is quite flimsy as you guys can see
we're gonna have a go though I'm just
gonna place to my bottom lashes
obviously as I said I can't believe ply
it to my top lashes problem with this
oh god of no I'm just smudge their exam
okay we're gonna remove that after is
it's really lumpy libel eat you just got
lumps or like every single lash like a
little creatures coming down my face
would just die down my lashes they look
so messy it's just really hard books is
so clumpy I found even explain it
so for packaging I'm gonna give this a
10 out of 10 because I think it's so
cute
never seen this done before but for
actual mascara this is probably cannot
see it like that maybe two three out of
ten I also did buy these colored
eyeliners well this glitter liners have
Aloka and these actually look super
pretty so maybe I'll try this another
time in my vlogs because these actually
do look like the picture and do look
super cute so you can see how I glittery
they are I think they actually are so
pretty these are think I'm really nice
however I thought you can kind of get
glitter liners anywhere from a pound
what a lot of places last but not least
we have this lipstick this is supposed
to be very long lasting and it's called
a magical halo I'm not sure it's average
during average oh it's not alright it's
a cloth let's gonna sign I remember me
getting alright so is
pink glass so how is it the glass it
should be glass right it might be member
oh no it's not oh oh that is so nice as
ice drawing Matt I feel like it's
definitely to Matt actually because look
at my lips
it looks very odd I don't know I thought
other colors so pretty though so I do
like this but I don't know it's it's not
the best formula but beyond that if I'm
being honest and I find Carver for this
video my makeup was actually looking
like half Jason now I'm thinking I'm not
too sure about everyone then is the end
of the video all in all I think some of
this makeup is actually quite nice
however I feel like you could probably
if you really look around and if you're
on a budget and you want to go get some
more affordable makeup you can probably
go find this somewhere else but you can
actually know what's inside the products
like I even think the pound store do
both online does do makeup I've done a
testing pound video I think oh maybe
have or if not I've seen bunch of people
that have so they definitely do do
makeup and Alicia actually gonna know
what's inside the products well they're
here majority of it's in a different
language so it's been annoying that I
don't actually have a clue what I put on
my face for all I recommend that you
don't buy makeup from well the power
make up from wish anyways because it
just didn't really work for me but
obviously you guys might have had
different experience of this like if
you've ever bought any makeup from wish
then definitely let me know down below
and let me know your thoughts on it and
stuff because I'm definitely very very
very interested thank you so so much for
watching and I'll see you guys very soon
bye
