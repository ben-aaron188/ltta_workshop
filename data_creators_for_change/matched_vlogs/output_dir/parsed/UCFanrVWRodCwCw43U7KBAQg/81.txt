hi everybody and happy holidays I hope
you guys are having a fab season so far
and you guys are in again in the
Christmasy spirit hopefully this video
does help you guys to get in the
Christmas espero I'm so excited it's a
little bit different to any video that
I've actually ever done on my channel
before now this is a kind of like
unboxing a mystery box I actually bought
from eBay
I imagine kind of nervous to do this
video because I feel like it could be 50
pounds well spent or 50 pounds
completely utterly wasted but obviously
guys that this isn't just any mystery
box because I think we're already seeing
them this is a Christmas mystery box I'm
so excited
and I feel like hopefully everything
inside is gonna be that little bit like
a festive and Christmassy
so it's really gonna get me in the
Christmasy movie so I don't want to show
my address as my address is on here hang
on let's do this somewhat on over here
you go this is my 50 pounds of mystery
Christmas box now it's not huge which
isn't necessarily a bad thing because
most presents come in no cuz the best
presents come in small packages
something like that right the best
things come in small packages that's
what it is something like that anyways
so I'm super duper duper excited I hope
you guys enjoy on a box in this box with
me I literally cannot wait I'm really
nervous though because honestly like
imagine finding 450 pounds and you have
no idea what it is it's actually like
nerve-wracking so every time that it
doesn't go to waste I hope you guys
enjoy this video it's not a big thumbs
up and subscribe down below if you guys
haven't already and without further ado
let's get in to opening what's inside
okay I've got a big knife right now by
the way guys don't play with knives at
home kids okay because it's not good I
feel kind of nervous sitting this all so
I'm just gonna oh this is exciting
let's rip this box open there we go
that's nice and easy brilliant stuff
going on we don't want to slice my hand
open
wait he'll open this there hang on there
we go okay so here we go let's open up
the box
okay Oh shop okay I can't really see
anything festive so far but I can see
chocolates and that is a good stop
so this is what I can first off see
inside the box
so let's actually proper get started and
tucked in I really hope there are some
like Christmasy bit because obviously
the last of this video is about I wasn't
much texted board games and stuff that's
what I'm feeling
okay so first up the first thing on top
as you guys would have just sees it is a
box of Cadbury milk trains this is what
I like to see in a mystery box because I
love food and the food junkie who
doesn't love chocolate I don't really
know how much this is maybe it's
probably about 7 pounds ish to buy
because it is quite a big box you've got
two layers in there you've got two rows
of chocolates
it's Cadbury and oh by the way I'm a
Cadbury go let me know if you like
Cadbury or galaxy because a mum and I
and my dad have the discussion all the
time and I'm a carefree girl my mom is a
galaxy girl and my dad is a Cadbury guy
so let me know down in the comments
there's a big debate about that if I've
got to vote in the puddle so anyway so
this is the person I got and I
definitely do love hope and it gets a
bit more Christmassy from this point
where I'm gonna take the bubble wrap off
I love our alright so by the way this is
a family Christmas box so it looks like
it has a little bit of everything which
kind of takes it off the box you've got
like boy stuff girly stuff kind of in
the middle we've got some like festive
reindeer bags here which is so adorable
these are so cute they look how made I
think these are so sweet so let's have a
look what's inside there's actually two
of them ok so inside this little one is
oh these are so cute I love little
things like this ok there it's our this
more chocolate and it's covering again
winning
I do love galaxies as well by the way
anyways let's not talk about chocolate
so I've got a little father Christmas
inside and I'm pretty sure inside this
little reindeer bag is the same thing oh
just broken it about you pressed it to
ours I've just broken the chocolate but
it does look good so they are very
festive and cute okay next up
okay so this is subtle somewhere ooh
this is a mana tune a perfume set this
is actually really lovely I would
personally love to receive this I think
it's so nice I love the packaging so
clearly you've got a body cream of
perfume and a shower cream so obviously
this is like a perfume gets that
honestly I think this can really be for
any age definitely people aged older as
well I think this would just be a really
nice gift for anybody I'm gonna smell
the path use inside I'm awful at like
describing scents so but yeah I'm really
liking the packaging my cock sucker
getting things out the box there we go
okay let's give this a smell so oh oh my
goodness that is so that is so nice I
would genuinely like I would go into a
shop smell that some wanna buy it like
immediately this is my kind of scent I
really don't want to go into like a load
of detail trying to describe it because
my sake describe and sense but it's like
a really nice and like the fresh kind of
said it's absolutely lovely definitely I
would pick this up it's so nice and I'm
assuming that the body cream of the
shower cream obviously smells the same
as well yes is that this is such a
lovely gift and I think this is a this
is really good actually so far for like
this box it's going good okay let's
carry on this I have no idea what it
says okay this is a designer own bad set
which is actually pretty cool
let's open up
so this is something that's definitely
different definitely would entertain
your kids definitely not my kids cuz I
don't have any kids but this is
definitely different
okay so it's like literally a bag I
thank you
yeah so this is all one at the shoulder
bars like the Golub I used to have like
in 2008 or whatever it was when I was in
your seventies have a go-to bag yeah
someone has a strap bag
okay this statue so cute okay so this is
the bag obviously and these pads I'm
assuming it's easy to draw on it's kind
of like that brackets but it is the
trapper
I'm already sure that the fabric is all
I know is clearly it's for like coloring
in here so this is actually really
really really lovely if the colors show
up really well I just thought oh this is
such a great idea I'm actually gonna
give this a go and just see like how
well it actually works and if the color
actually shows up so like I have to love
coloring in okay oh yeah it does show up
pretty Wow hang on am i doing like a
little patch test for you guys I think
it's just normal coloring pen so I think
it's any special kind of like coloring
pen which is kind of better look
yeah actually shows up so well that is
actually such a nice gift like my little
cousins would honestly love that I think
that's like a genius idea it's so simple
but such a good and clever idea not that
Christmassy but would be a great like
Christmas present right so we're already
on to the last thing inside the box so
there wasn't is that means that much
inside the box but it felt like it's a
pretty it it's a lot better than what I
thought it was gonna be like definitely
not that festive and definitely aimed to
a family of four without the dad cuz it
open you know what the dad's gonna gonna
have I mean maybe we could have the
chocolates I guess so the very last
thing inside the box is this
remote-control helicopter which is kind
of like it's okay it's for I guess this
would be more aimed towards a younger
boy I mean obviously girls from uses as
well this is a plus but I feel like I
would get this for somebody maybe a
little bit younger obviously it has like
a set as sales sticker that's obviously
it might take it off as well which is
perfectly fine because I guess this is
what like the whole video is kind of
like about like seeing what you get and
stuff but I mean don't really know what
to say about it it's okay it's a
remote-control helicopter is probably
something this discontinued so it's not
like a new out thing you know but it's
not gonna be because it's a mystery box
and it's 50 pounds so more 450 pounds
I've got a box of chocolates a
helicopter a remote-control toy I got a
designer and bath maybe for like a
little girl I got a perfume set and I
got some more chocolates inside these
that little reindeer bags overall I
think it's definitely a lot better than
what I thought it would be definitely
not like a Christmasy and I feel like I
could definitely got myself and probably
get all of this may be similar or if not
personally a little bit better but you
know what it is better than what I
thought it would be I just wish they
kind of put like maybe some like
reindeer is inside or maybe like a
Christmas kind of like puzzle game or I
mean they're not really that much into
puzzles but you know something more kind
of like Christmassy related more fun for
family I feel like this is a family box
that you could get all throughout the
year rather than just Christmas time it
hasn't really got that much to do with
Christmas but overall I feel like I feel
like there's definitely better than what
I thought it would be so everybody I
have an empty box right now and there is
my 50 pounds gone let me know if you
thought it was personally worth it by
voting in the polar coordinate is you
would buy a 50 pound mystery box if it
turned out like this
obviously it's a family box so it's got
kind of an little thing for everybody
kind of ish so yeah make sure you let me
know by voting in the poll and down
