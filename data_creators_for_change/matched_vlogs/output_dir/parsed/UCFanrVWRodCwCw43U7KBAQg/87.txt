clothes on as well
so everybody have you guys enjoy it's
much alike and subscribe down below if
you guys haven't already and hold it let
me know your favorite item of the whole
hall anyways let's go in the video right
so far sir I've got this lovely jumper
it's like really soft it's like a really
lovely soft cotton and it's like cool
tone you know for the winter so it's
like a pale gray as you can see and it
hangs it really really really lovely
because it doesn't have like a waistband
at the bottom and even those are not we
playing
doesn't really have that much going on
it is really lovely because it has these
bows at the side that you can tie up and
I just think they're really pretty so if
you guys wasn't gonna put more basic
that ISM kind of like too much in your
face then you're gonna love this jumper
because it's also very pretty because it
has the bows on the side so this is the
first thing that I picked up and this
was how much was it 13 pounds by the way
this is like the softest thing ever
I'm not even kidding okay all right so
nectar oh my goodness the sec I saw this
I was like so this is the cutest thing
ever I saw this before I saw the Hat so
they do actually have a matching hat
which obviously I had to get as well so
I got this scarf I think it's the cutest
thing ever because you guys know that I
literally love faux fur so much I just I
just think it looks so cute
so I got this like what looks like a
knitted scarf and I feel like it's the
sweetest thing oh my oh my god I'm
struggling I just wear like this acacia
thing ever because it has like little
pom-pom flare at the bottom so I thought
this was so cute and I was like oh my
god I need that in my life then I sort
of had like a big sign that said that
you can get like the matching set so I
was like okay like I need to find this
right now so I went on a mission around
Primark and then I also found the
matching knitted beanie which is so cute
so the beanie was three pounds and it's
super cute and then the scarf was let's
have a look how much was the scarf I
don't think it was that expensive six
pounds so for the same nine pounds which
is pre marched a bargain big stuff is
this very thick cable net
mustard-colored
cardigan now I better wanted like a
knitted kind of like capable knit
cardigan for the longest time I can
never really just find one that really
like caught my army because I feel like
cardigans are a funny one they can even
look like really really really like you
don't put much effort in but actually
they look super cute or it can just look
kind of like mommy so this one I fell in
love with fuzzy because I love this
color you guys know that it's like it's
so old it's just such an autumnal like
winter color and I just like this is my
color this year so I loved it so much I
think it's so sweet it's not really much
to say about it but it hangs really
nicely
so so so comfy and obviously I love the
color and I love how it feels as well
because also super soft okay this this
is a little bit extra and I don't really
know what made me want to buy this but
actually I love it this is this is kind
of a love or hate because it's quite out
there so this is a leopard print coat I
think is actually so nice I feel like is
one of those things it depends what you
kind of like wear it with so pretty much
this is like a long of a laser so
obviously it has the collar here it's
also lined inside as well so you would
keep you warm so I just feel like as
well as this being brilliant it's a
little bit more out there's a little bit
out of my comfort zone and just feel
like it's really cute and depending on
what I wear it with it can really really
make it outfit so I'm actually really
really really feeling this and I love it
so much this was a little bit more
expensive thing obviously because it has
the lining inside and because I mean
it's a comb and it's gonna keep me warm
so this is the 30 pounds it's a little
bit more expensive this I mean I've
never actually bought anything Primark
that cost thirty pounds like that's why
I think it's expensive but honestly if I
bought this from summer like Topshop
it'll probably be like 75 pound plus so
really it's pretty affordable before
Primark it's a little bit more pricey
right there's one thing that's gonna get
you in the Christmas mood this is going
to be here this is the best thing ever
so it's a mrs. Claus and dressing gown
you can also get actually like Santa
Claus as well it is so soft like you can
you can see by looking at it how softer
the fur is it is so so so beautiful
inside the whole way down it's soft fur
as well it's the comfiest thing it looks
adorable on it also says mrs. Claus on
the back as well which is so adorable so
like if you I don't know you and your
friends with you and your boyfriend's
you have that matching one Santa mrs.
Claus so just like this is the best
thing ever and also I love dressing
girls don't hang too low that keeps 3/4
length so it's not like it goes the
whole way down sit for like they're just
a bit annoying so this is the best thing
ever
I've got it in a size smaller and it was
15 pounds I feel like dressing gowns for
dramas
and like snuggly staff you like that big
throws I fell Oprah Mac Windsor that
liked their fur is so soft just think
ever like they are winning so I've got
more like snuggly bears because as I
said they're like my favorite things so
these I mean how are you not want a pair
of cozy Fitzy's like how these are the
best things ever these are three pound
15 which i think are so so so good i
bought it or reindeer fantasies because
I am honestly obsessive Christmas if you
haven't noticed already so anything to
do Christmas is like 10 times cuter than
anything else so I got these I love them
so so much I can literally cannot wait
to put my feet in these they done Disney
ones Star Wars wands they honestly done
absolutely everything three pound 50
such a bargain and also feel like this
is such a good like suck and fill out or
like a little gift somebody as well
they're so cute
I'm not no of snuggly things being at my
favorite things in Primark so I also
picked up this onesie which is so so so
adorable I'm never ever ever gonna wear
this when I have a full face of makeup
on this is definitely what I go to bed
because honestly me and white don't do
very well I just couldn't resist because
it's the cutest thing ever
as you guys can see it's kind of got
that like knitted and look it's not
knitted because it's really soft but it
does have really intricate patterns so
it's actually beautiful I love this so
so much and I'm never in a million years
would a guess is from Primark also it
has like the little paw Paw's as well
and then it has a really really fuzzy
fur hood that is so soft again with
little ears which is so adorable and the
great thing with this as well is I feel
like sometimes the onesies with feet in
it could be really annoying so they
don't actually have like little feet in
it as well so yeah it's great
it's pretty much like my dream one day
honestly so last but not least my
favorite thing of the entire haul I got
these boots they are high knee boots and
they are so so cute because I've been
shy about even last year I said for
Christmas I wanted to get great
knee-high boots because I love knee-high
boots but I can never ever find great
ones I love so I found these ones in
Primark they are 22 pounds so as you can
see they're like charcoal gray and they
also like that kind of like suede
material
elasticated down the backs and they're a
bit more stretchy obviously they have
this set which i think is just really
lovely they silver up than gold okay I'm
not going to demonstrate taking them
down because clearly I can but yeah I
just think these are really really
really lovely and never in a million
years would I think they are from
Primark and I just found out why I can't
do this zip down because the aboriginal
zip in this side
so obviously this sit here it's just an
extra piece of detailing to make them
look prettier so that would be why yeah
these I also think are so lovely so
everybody there is the end of the video
I really hope you guys enjoyed I felt
like I had so much stuff when I was
shopping like that took up five bags I
think because the like smuggling stuff
is so so so big and then I did kind of
get some other like needle back so I
feel like they're in a bit boring to
show I did get some like really cute
gloves so I'm obsessed with like little
hair bags and stuff so maybe that took
more space I don't know but I hope you
guys enjoyed this clothing haul I feel
like I've never already done a Primark
clothing all before I definitely done
like a big hole with that like homeworks
they do have great and we're just saying
okay so Phoebe homework anyways yes
