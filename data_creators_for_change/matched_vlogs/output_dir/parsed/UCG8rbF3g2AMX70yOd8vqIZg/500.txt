is my balcony every morning I get to
come out and see the beautiful city of
Atlanta yes oh I got chairs dude this is
great also this is cool thing hey how
you doing Logan okay back to the intro
let me just say it is also a Christmas
miracle that I was able to bring my bird
maverick he's in the other room yep
there he is yeah higher average when I
got to the airport they told me it is
not their policy to allow birds on the
planes I said no not gonna listen to you
and I did it anyways cuz I'm a Sabbath
illegally smuggled my bird here and now
we're here we're live we're doing it
were here excuse me I'm looking for a
little parrot first name my last name
boy there he is there he is what's that
buddy that's what I'm talking about bro
yes so basically the dream team is here
I'm feeling a little sick I had these
like raccoon marks under my eyes but
I'll be okay I think not gonna lie hope
to be living here for the next month oh
it's gonna be freaking dope except when
I went to eat breakfast this morning I
did have a little issue so first I woke
up I shot out of bed like a rocket then
I took a second to listen to Rebecca
Black's hit song Friday
bang bang bang keep an eye walked out of
the room I grabbed a bowl I grabbed a
cereal and then I hate this cereal oh
but in the in real life I was
actually eat the cereal yet no for the
vlog I'm just eating like nothing I
guess I then put the empty cereal bowl
in the sink and then I looked around and
it hit me
fuck fuck is right man there's no one
here to do with dull things like laundry
or dishes or help me put on my socks I
have to do all these things myself
no I could do this I could do this okay
okay that's enough of local ranting for
the day let's get the day started shall
we
so being that some of the cast members
on this film are like a list celebrities
I feel like this is where vlogging is
going to be kind of hard for me because
I don't know what I'm allowed to film
and what I'm not allowed to film but I'm
going to the table read right now go
check it out bro I'm on the ceiling how
you doing like it's good table read is
exactly what it sounds like basically
the whole cast sits are on the table and
you guessed it reads ha ha this is just
me good morning good morning good good
good Atlanta is beautiful yeah first
time here this place is amazing
Wow look at the city Wow
what is there to do around here I heard
there's an aquarium there's like an art
exhibit what else was popping
everything's popping here impossible
weird - can't use the year whoa I love
that house the aquarium I paid to this
man with the sharks you can pay to swim
with the sharks
I think I'm gonna do that oops bi-stable
read time this is the area that I was in
last night when was super dark not so
shading the daytime let's go Atlanta
whoo okay just got back I know I'm
avvakum sorry give me one second yeah
one second for the blog one sec thank
you something I really wanted to do
today but the table retook like five
hours was taken Instagram picture to let
everyone know that I I moved to Atlanta
I clearly did not have time to do that
in the Sun is setting now it's getting a
little dark but I still want to take a
picture so okay so this view is dope and
you guys know me I always like to
elevate my content quite literally in
this case because I'm gonna stand on the
edge of this balcony and if I fall Logan
Paul is dunzo don't forget to like it
subscribe okay no time for jokes I'm
literally about to risk my life for a
photo and I don't even have a camera man
dude it's lurch is that guy which is me
hey how you doing
this picture this cool I wish my arm was
extended i'ma go again I'm sorry but
this picture sucks I have to go a third
time third time's the charm right that's
what they say so this is the setup right
here I have no idea this is gonna work
but as you can see the photo is flames
so taking the past 10 minutes or so to
reflect upon the consequences of my
actions what I did out there was not
smart and the important thing to
remember is USA I'm just kidding uh this
is no time for jokes the important thing
to remember is to canvass
okay back to this one
wait is that get back to this okay
enough enough of the jokes Logan the
important thing to remember is this I
don't always do the smartest thing in
fact I might go as far to say that I
never do
the smartest thing and it's very
important to people it's very important
that you or you or you
whoever's watching this please do not
try to recreate the things I do I am I
don't I'm sitting here on me still it's
Logan hey how are you how you doing I
don't know why I did that
like when I really think about it like I
dunno I like to get a dope Instagram
picture which by the way the pic sucks
