in why did you
I'm really like funny about that stuff
too like I didn't even cheer I didn't
matter if it was my I rather do that did
not brush my teeth but you can you can
really get mouthwash and scrub your
teeth with them with the towel it don't
feel the same but using somebody else's
to brush though I wouldn't use it as
anybody too much
I trusted her from already was doing
certain things with Italy but they don't
it don't make it right I have used
someone else's toothbrush but it was by
accident and I was mad as hell I was mad
I wouldn't be mad to it like I would be
mad at for me personally I didn't even I
don't even like using the same wash
towels anyone like yeah you know I'm
saying like I'm that's just the kind of
person I am definitely I was mad I was
just I mean and not because I felt like
he like was nasty or anything like that
I'm nauseous I'm just saying because
like dang like everything is fine I see
the way yeah militia is honest we can't
lie
thank you so come on let's keep it going
let's see how spicy this can really get
never have I ever lied to my partner
about where I was at
I'm trying to think let's see mr. sneaky
I know you have probably I have I feel
like I've had good reasons good reasons
why first of all why do you have the
undiscussed which you Faison already
I didn't seen your face you know I
didn't sell discuss it with you I was
just thinking about I was just thinking
about like my answer
I don't know still have an answer I
don't know people I don't know if how to
live I don't and if I did if I was like
where you went on down the street but
I'm really not like I never been on no
sneaky stuff like not a guy's house and
it got me that's that's what I'm saying
us know I've always told the truth so I
can honestly say I have not I'm a very
good girl you know I'm a very good girl
I have no reason to I'm a little girl
he's a bad boy I'm sorry I'm an angel
alrighty angel your angel give me one
good reason then cuz I want to know did
you alright
reason number one girls are crazy
there's the dice they really crazy
because your own credit you're not 12
she's sometimes I would lie because the
thing that I'm doing does it sound
believable
like what like I feel like yeah I don't
really like
to know that we have in like fun you get
what I'm saying I wouldn't you know why
wouldn't we want to have fun like once
you guys have fun I mean so I would like
oh I'm not you guys I feel like us
females don't want we don't want y'all
to be bored or anything we do want try
to have fun just make sure you not out
there doing stuff you're not supposed to
be doing all right but I'm just saying
well we're not with you guys it's like a
whole another that's not true for every
girl that's not true for every girl it's
not true every girl I think so that is
my opinion it's probably just because
you you've only dealt with not you know
you haven't dealt with a lot of girls
oh so for you to say y'all girls are
crazy right right
everybody's not like that I've only
dated one - he was only dating one girl
er Thanks
two if you count on a high school
sweetheart prom date problem reason like
that's hard to believe like I believe it
but it would be hard to believe probably
Jen I'm only spoke to one group no you
haven't spoken to me I haven't spoken to
one girl but I've only dated and went
out in May one girl my girlfriend yes -
if you want to count the girl I took the
prompt because we went out but it was
like an immature kinda yeah like a kitty
kitty Kanye's like high schools me or
even Connor we had a crush on each other
stuff Oh which I just call myself dating
never have I ever
Oh spicy oh hey I'm really sorry Kim I
don't know how to you gonna teach me I
don't know you only got a wand it always
you could just rock with it it's hard to
do while sit down but you got it like
the one you won't be no you don't equate
from them more of a kind of smooth like
Oh Mike I'm sturdy with it hey okay
never have I ever faked an orgasm
so in my terms it would be climax yeah
like I picked an orgasm I like basically
act like act like he was having this
contact like this in public you have X I
have so I'm gonna laugh you're all
stronger than junk overweight backs get
some tarnish if it's trash my trash
breath is like you're not having a good
time my curtain is like hot wait how

know you can't lie to me that's gonna
write it that's you're not gonna look in
a comment no but no you're you you you

certain life they have a certain way
that you can tell but they did or not
you can tell us nigga didn't the N dude
you know you can tell you can tell when
you about to UM like you said not
everybody you can tell so where everyone
has a face when they know

wasn't is what I'm saying so you act
like you might do but it wasn't it
wasn't as height is that made it seem to
be like it might not have been mad but
it wasn't I it felt like so basically I
was making whoever my is the man like he
was super saying like like Bambi best
best play in the league he was he was on
a bench he wasn't really on the bench he
just was like not a valuable player
like he was on the court he could have
got traded yeah he could easily get

nah no no no okay we got about the same
time all right but whatever you ask
Knicks girl now lady okay you're needed
okay okay um never have I ever made a
sex tape spicy
which is it good because you know I have
and nobody will ever ever get a hold of
that when they get along the yours I
have it for real yes I do
how did you guys do it for oh it's not
for sale
how much would you so TMZ for I don't
think I just agreed it was which is
right it wasn't with no reading today it
wasn't so would a random girl oh how I
look making a sexting with random girl
yeah did she expose you I would have
been exposed already
but you said you have it so I have you
guys in that that nobody will ever see
that never don't you ever ever feel like
I said you guys will never have my
footage ever but we got the next
question okay just know that I have nose
very spicy spicy where's your lieutenant
Mike 12
hot spices your spicy up gonna kill me
never have I ever
however had feelings for someone but
hidden I still cuz I wouldn't say
feelings like that just like that he
would I have one in your library tour
net no cuz like I want to know what you
mean so could maybe I have to change my
answer when you like when you really
like someone and you feel like you you
can't you're not supposed to like when
you really like somebody and like you
have feelings for them feelings like
well you said really like more than you
like them more than you like them more
than what you're supposed to like them
for but you hide them because you know
you probably can't have them
like you know you can't have them or you
know that they probably just hard to
like or like you hide them because you
don't know what they have the same
feelings for you I'm pretty I'm pretty
bold so I don't think I would even if
you felt like someone even if you didn't
know or not if somebody had feelings for
you you feel like I'm a person you still
would let them know you have villains
how do you let the strokes how would you
really bold like how do you let them
know like what you do you just know you
just hit him up and saying hey I got
come on like how are you gonna do it
like I wouldn't be I'm pretty sure that
you show somebody have feelings with
your actions
yeah that's why I would do that like in
person and I was like like if I like you
you go no no no cuz some people can see
my dear white people but they just be
nice no I know different I think I do
and I think it'll look like tech I think
you know what though the difference
between them so what that likes you
right so they're gonna be a nice you got
sleepy over here this is late it's late
it's manly I'm tired I want to say
sleepy oh um yeah I've definitely done
that I definitely do that a lot
wait I can't no I've done it a lot you
hid your film
again two people died cuz you didn't
know how they would feel towards you
yeah don't know why cuz I'm scary
diction that's what I'm not scared of
rejection because nigga you don't get
rejected you barely get rejected
stop playing nice it's been rare
rejections be rare for me but rejects
your heart feels don't get it twisted I
know how rejection has been reared for
me too but I haven't even let it happen
you know I haven't gave your own happen
cuz if I feel like you're not feeling me
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna show you
that I ain't bout to feel stupid or get
my feelings hurt no I feel you but then
again though you shouldn't you shouldn't
live life like there imagine how your
feelings were hurt if you thought the
money I like you or you like to Joe shot
and like you get shot down I can't do
that I feel so like hurt honestly I
would feel like butt
better yeah like cuz if now I don't have
to waste my time you don't like me I'll
get you did sit yeah you're just
different good that's one thing I don't
have
