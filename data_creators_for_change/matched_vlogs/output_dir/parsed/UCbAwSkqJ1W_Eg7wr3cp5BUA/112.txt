I keep burping because I hit myself in
the throat with the Beautyblender so
forcefully hello friends and welcome to
another video today we're going to be
doing something that's been requested a
lot so today I'm going to be doing an
everyday makeup routine now before we
get started with the video I sort of say
thank you guys so so much for all of
your love and support over the last
couple of weeks you guys making so email
I know that some people find hard
hands-free cringy but serious heart
hands so this everyday makeup routine is
kind of like the routine that I do
during the week when I have time to do
my makeup and also when I'm shooting a
lot of my videos a lot of my videos will
see this as kind of like my standard
makeup looks because this is kind of
what I can accomplish in a reasonable
amount of time just a disclaimer before
we get started with the makeup I'm not a
makeup artist I have never been trained
in makeup really in any way all I know
about makeup is just through trial and
error and me hopelessly trying to
recreate online beauty tutorials but I
really like makeup I like expressing
myself through makeup and I just I like
collecting lipstick you guys know I'm
crazy about lipstick a second disclaimer
this is the first time I've ever filmed
like a really close-up beauty routine
type video so just know that you're
about to get close-up in my face you're
going to be in my grille but I'm
inviting you into my grille but just no
but you might see some nose hair so
that's when you know we're really close
the nose hairs they just they bring the
intimacy level of just another notch all
right here we go let's get into it
punching now so the first thing I like
to do is to put a hair wrap that's
failed
put a hair wrap on this thing
simultaneously makes me feel like
gallery up and the Cheetah Girls and
also Sharpay from high school musical
now this is on let's begin I'm going to
put primer on this is the cue face
hangover RX replenishing face primer I
bought it because it said it has coconut
water in it and I love coconut oh man
whoa next I like to do is have a drink
of a beverage
if you're wondering am i drinking
capri-sun the answer is yes Pacific
cooler is the best flavor final lot
don't at me alright once you're done
with your primer I like to start with my
eyebrows so I use this Anastasia that
really held brow definer this
like the kind of easier pencil I think
that kind of comes out in like a little
triangle form I think this is a lot
easier to use in the pencil itself I
think the pencil you kind of just have
to be more artistic with it or is it
this one you can just be like yeah man I
pretty much like to just fill in the
sparseness and then I like to kind of
like fill in the top as well and create
a little bit more of like a what would
you call this an art my saga with my
eyebrows is lifelong when I was young I
had like a cute - wispy unibrow and then
when puberty hit it became a
full-fledged like Edie Edie and edit
unibrow I wasn't really allowed to do
hair removal until I heard went rogue at
age 13 I plucked my brows into tadpoles
and I really just depleted the little
hairs that grow under here like I would
pluck them without mercy like every
single day he's going to do this really
quick yeah I need to look at this
straight on otherwise my brows are just
going to become more systems another
thing I like about doing my brows first
is that if I mess up I can kind of just
smear it off without messing up any of
the rest of my makeup pretty much my
entire makeup routine is just structure
to try and like maximize the
opportunities for fixing things so the
next thing that I do is find something
that I don't know where my is so
the next thing I usually do is put some
eyeshadow primer on I use the Urban
Decay primer potion I like it a lot
I just put a little bit on my fingers
and then just go in to my lids with my
fingers like this I don't wear a ton of
eyeshadow on a daily basis this is more
just like kind of just to like make my
eyelid look better in general I also
find that this helps keep my eyeliner on
after the eyeshadow primer I go in with
my color correcting and concealer stuff
this is the NYX dark circle concealer
corrector I can use my finger just wash
your hand you know long as you wash your
hands after you pee now I'm going to put
on my face makeup I use the NYX BB cream
in the color golden run ashame on other
days I use more full coverage foundation
but on a daily basis I use this guy I
really actually do like it
I have combo skin and I feel like at the
very end of a long day this does
definitely get a little shiny but I like
it so much I don't
I just like keep a little powder compact
on hand so I just squirt a little bit
out in my hand I know everyone has their
own method of putting their foundation
on their face but I find Beauty Blender
to be the most common so you're going to
sit in the face by a tiny pillow over
and over again we are so sorry member
samie okay so once you're almost
finished dabbing what I do next is I go
in with my concealer from a little
pimple mole pimp's this is the NYX HD
studio photogenic concealer and I use
the color beige I'm usually beige like
an envoy so understand put a little bit
of concealer over this little pimples
have been popping up I'm going to add my
concealer under my eyes as well just any
little place around like some seems like
I could use a little help over there and
then I'm going to take my Beauty Blender
once again and continue to dab I find
that with the BB cream you can be pretty
gentle in your beading of your own face
but with a concealer I feel like you
really gotta take yourself a little bit
I know I make a ton of weird faces when
I'm doing my makeup specifically this
like fish gave me one and always like
one time I was like oh my god what a
great makeup YouTube challenge try and
do your makeup without making any faces
at all
and then I realized it would just be
footage of everyone just being like
completed the challenge I'm just going
to get around my neck area as well just
to kind of you know not have that weird
line so I'm going to dab a little bit
around my neck
all whoo that I thought serious and
hitting myself in the esophagus is my
beauty blunder this made me burp the
next thing I do is start setting up my
eyeliner this is like my only makeup
hack and I don't know if it's a half
because I feel like it's something that
a lot of people do I'll take my
concealer and I'll take this little
brush this is the real technique by Sam
and Nick I love these brushes by the way
and this is the accent brush I think
this came and like the eye packet so I
will basically I'll try and show you
guys what I do is I take a little bit of
concealer and I draw a really faint line
from the edge of my eye to the end of my
eyebrow my eyebrows grow longer on the
sides so I have to make sure that like
in between getting my brows done I have
to kind of maintain this brow link
otherwise my cat eyes get like kind of
like lower and lower and lower so now
that that line is down and we've got
some templates for the future the next
thing I do is think how I baked is
basically I take the Laura Mercier loose
setting powder and my damp Beauty
Blender and I shake it up a little bit
so we've got some you know powder in the
top part and I like to dab it in and you
make a snow storm but basically I have
enough powder on here and then I like go
a lot of powder under my eye on my
forehead my nose and my chin mmm that's
good
the thing about this that I wear a lot
of dark colors so using a lot of light
powder it just creates some like
dandruff looking situations I kind of
have mild dandruff - but you know this
just create even more of that like snow
storm effect so I just like to sort of
clean myself up afterwards with a makeup
wipe or a lint brush or something the
theory behind baking is that you just
put a lot of powder on your face your
makeup kind of gets trapped and it will
bake like with the heat of your body and
set even more so this is a way to like
sort of eliminate as much shine as
possible and kind of like make your
makeup as long-lasting as possible as
I'm talking I'm seeing like little
snowflakes like fall in front of my eyes
and I'm like mmm nailing it so the next
thing I do is actually go in and do my
eyeliner while the rest of my face is a
bacon so I use the Lancome
whiner I've been told that I don't
pronounce Lancome correctly and I'm very
sorry I do not know how to pronounce it
I got this on a holiday gift set and I
tried it and pretty much from like first
youth I was like I'm probably going to
keep using this
I've already repurchased with one time I
just did that without telling you what I
was doing so basically what I do is I
take my eyeliner and I draw a wing along
the lines of concealer and that's how I
try and make my eyeliner it's even if
possible when I'm drawing in like the
rest of my eyeliner I kind of like to do
it like halfway through the wing and I
kind of drag it across and then I like
go in and fill in the rest of the cat
eye that even ah prick it's going to be
even I feel like I have a hard time
talking while also doing my eyeliner
feel like for everything else I can kind
of be like chatting and you know hanging
out and with eyeliner I'm like oh my god
can you guys see my shirt my boobs are
just covered in powder in case I make
any little mistakes of my eyeliner I
like to just take a little bit more
concealer and I have another little big
brush it's another Real Techniques brush
it's from the same like intro to eyes
set and it's called the fine liner brush
but basically like if I go over like
mess up or is uneven at all I just take
a little bit of concealer and then just
kind of make it straight again at this
point you kind of have like a line of
concealer on top of your eyeliner so
I'll just like take my finger and just
like kind of blend that out just a
little bit I feel like those powders
been on my face long enough what I used
to take off my baking powder is this
Real Techniques contour brush and I'm
just like kind of just cement swipe it
off kind of yes like that crap off you
hear more dandruff on my clothes please
oh yeah I love that I just kind of made
that fly into my hair it'll just mix it
the real dandruff up there what I like
to do next is take my Real Techniques
all-over powder brush I think that's
what it's called all the lettering has
rubbed off on this one I just like to
take a little bit more translucent
powder and just kind of do like its
overall coat I feel like there's no set
time in my makeup routine when I prep my
lips but let's just do it now I'm going
to take the bite Beauty which cherry
fruit scrub and put a little exfoliant
on my lips this is the one that I got
from the bite lip lab
I do really like it I think it's a fun
one and it tastes great do I eat makeup
yes on purpose
occasionally so what I do next is go in
is a little bit of powder contour and
just kind of like define the face I use
this Kat Von D shade and light palette
I've had this thing for a while now
probably almost a year if not maybe
longer but as you guys can see I have
not hit pan yet and I use it almost
every day basically what I like to do is
I take this Real Techniques contour
brush and I usually like to use this
shade on the side I have never even
looked at the name what is the name of
the shade
it's called subconscious I'm also not
very awesome at contouring I mostly try
and focus in on just getting the
cheekbone contour and then I just kind
of like to put some dark powder and
other places too so I do the fishing
thing and then I put the powder in the
fishing place when I do the fish thing I
feel like I have a hollow that is kind
of lower so I kind of try and cheat it
up a little bit so it doesn't look like
my face is like glue I feel like decide
right now looks like a skid mark but
we're just going to keep going once I
like you which is a little bit on the
sides I'm going to blend it out later so
I usually just take the same
subconscious shade and it's like put
some under my neck you know just to kind
of help and I do just a little stroke on
either side of the nosey and I put a
little bit up here what I like to do
next is like bronzer / brush if you
think brush
I mean blush I have a lot of different
bronzers that I use one that I really
really love is this addition formula
butter bronzer about half the time I
feel like it smells like a tropical
getaway and the other half of the time
when I get a whiff of this thing I'm
like that smells like the lobby of a
Vegas hotel but good memories made there
as well I'm using this before a brand
uniform complexion powder brush and just
kind of like taking surrounder and
putting it on my cheeks like this this
bronzer in the summer would be too light
for me but right now like in the dead of
winter it's pretty perfect next I'll
take a little bit of this NYX
soft-spoken blush just a really small
amount and just on like the apples I
just my little bit ins like hey there I
am so once again I'm going to go back
with a little bit of translucent powder
try and not get too much on myself but
it's already a lost cause at this point
and then just set my makeup and kind of
like blend out a little bit the contour
and everything so the next thing I like
to do is go in with a little bit of
highlighter this is the color pop
highlighter in churro
just put a little bit on your finger and
then you kind of like put some right
here on your cheekbone sometimes I'll
put some highlighter like on my nose or
on my Cupid's bow but the only other
place that I really actually put
highlighter every single day is under my
brow bone and then we can take down our
high school musical headband so we just
have mascara waterline and lips left the
eyeliner that I like to use on my
waterline is this NYX slide on glide on
stay on and definitely a turn-on I
didn't make that up that's actually the
name I put this on the waterline on the
bottom part of my eyes just to make my
eyes a little bigger
I feel like this part is definitely the
kind of thing that you could see this
and be like I never want to do my makeup
like that looks painful and it doesn't
feel great at this time while I'm
struggling to put this eyeliner on my
waterline I'm going to finish out my
Capri Sun not sponsored by Capri Sun or
Costco but Costco give me a call record
something else second last thing is
mascara I like to buy the small bottles
of mascara because I feel like I don't
actually use too much mascara and I know
you're supposed to rebuy them pretty
often do they expire quickly so I just
like to buy small ones and also small
one this is small so this is Too Faced
better than sex mascara I feel like I
will not necessarily get mascara on like
my upper lids but I'll get mascara a lot
of times like under my eyes so I just
take my little baby brush that had that
concealer on it this little fine liner
guy and then I just you know sort of
clean it up at the bottom once again my
makeup routine is optimized for
opportunities to fix the mistakes you've
just made alright so the very last thing
is lipstick one of my favorite lipstick
brands colour-pop this one is in point
zero it's like a really brownie nude
color usually my go-to for like an
everyday look is a brownie nude and then
if I'm feeling more dramatic you guys
know that I go straight for the very
dark colors okay so I'm pretty sure
that's my whole face if I forgotten
something well it's too late now we
can't go back so that is my everyday
makeup routine a lot of times I find
myself doing this routine partially in
my bedroom
then partially in the car and then
partially in a random public bathroom
but usually if I'm in my bedroom or my
bathroom I can get this baby done in
about thirty minutes plus if any of you
