hello friends and welcome to another
video this week I'm gonna be getting a
Tokyo street fashion makeover yes we're
going to Japan and we're gonna be
getting made over so earlier this year
we traveled to three different US cities
to explore how fashion differs in
different regions so this time we're
gonna be taking our experiment
international right over the Pacific
Ocean
I feel like Japanese fashion trends
specifically what I've heard called Hara
tjuku fashion or Tokyo Street fashion
are talked about a lot online in videos
and articles to the point where I
definitely have an image in my head of
what I think it looks like but I wanted
to go to Japan and see for myself
so to do this we're gonna be teaming up
with the local who will guide us through
three different current trends so we can
get a little taste of what Tokyo street
fashion is all about now obviously this
won't cover everything that people wear
in Tokyo as Street fashion is pretty
different from your everyday wear and
this probably also won't even cover
every inch of Tokyo Street fashion
because from what I've seen there's a
lot but we're hoping to find three
outfits that capture some of what's
going on right now all right let's go so
step one of our Tokyo makeover was to
fly to Tokyo and while there we stayed
in Akasaka which is sort of a business
sea area that's very picturesque green
and quiet and it was also decently close
to her juku which is where a lot of the
action is in terms of Tokyo street
fashion to aid us in our search we met
up with rinrin who is a youtuber and a
lolita model as well as being pretty
well acquainted with the local tokyo
fashion scene right off the bat rinrin
clarified that tokyo street fashion
tends to be a little different than the
common Western perception a lot of
people tend to think that if you come to
Harajuku you'll see a lot of people
dressed in like Lolita or the most
recent style is like yummy
kawaii which is kind of a dark kawaii
but you don't really tend to see that as
much and for this video we wanted to
focus on the
current street fashion trends and not
just on the more well-known subcultures
how would you describe tokyo street
fashion today there's less emphasis on
the silhouette and a more eclectic type
of style a lot of people like to layer
and express their creativity and put
color into their about fit also Harajuku
is a neighbourhood and not just a
singular style as it can sometimes be
presented which was news to me at least
so I'm going to be showing you three
styles that are a general idea of what
you'll see on the streets today with the
first trend being the vintage remake
style which centers around transforming
old vintage clothing a lot of kids like
to take these items and cut it up and
add things onto it so they're very
one-of-a-kind styles the second trend
being the minimalistic mode style you'll
see a lot of people wearing this and
layering black on black that sounds like
my my type of thing sometimes I like to
dress up like a bat would a bat look
work there no never mind and then the
third and final trend the colorful
layered style you can layer things on so
much and things are transparent and
things are like colorful and it's
basically you could play with anything
you want so without further ado we were
ready to start shopping for our Tokyo
street fashion inspired outfits and our
first stop was the store an incapacity
which specializes in vintage remake so
an in compute capacity is located in the
Oda wadda neighborhood which means that
it's just behind the main part of hora
jakku it's a more hipster e type of
vintage area hipsters they're everywhere
the store itself is a former cigarette
shop tucked away on the third floor of
what looks almost like an apartment
building inside pretty much every inch
of it is covered in vintage
paraphernalia from the 1950s onwards and
a lot of it is recognizable IP with a
little bit of a twist looking around the
store
many of the remade items are sort of
like vintage t-shirts spliced with tutus
and though they're not all t-shirt
the general vibe seems to be bringing
together in Congress pieces into one
garment to make something completely new
usually with a new shape as well we were
also able to ask the store's owner mr.
Ohashi some questions about the vintage
remake style he led off by saying that
there aren't really rules about shape or
style within the trend itself
he doesn't like tell people what to wear
he says there's a lot of people who wear
it like form-fitting or just totally
loose it's all up to you what you see
here and you just kind of put it all
together and in terms of what is in the
store it seems that mr. Ohashi does a
lot of the curating and his wife Kathy
does a lot of the cutting and remaking
so where do you find like your
inspiration like when you see a piece
like how do you know if you like it or
if you want it to be in your store so
his inspiration comes mainly from punk
so music as well as the vintage fashions
which actually makes a lot of sense
because there's a strong emphasis on DIY
in Punk style in terms of what I should
be wearing mr. Ohashi recommended that
we just walk around the store and see
what caught our eye yo easy this huh
yeah it's a kind of like a devious
mischief afoot immediately I noticed a
bunch of breezy tunic style tops I know
you said bats were not in but it might
be like an unconscious bat yeah
absolutely the bat just slides in and as
if on cue the next thing I found was
this oh oh it's a Nike shirt with
batwing yeah yeah it seems like fortune
had smiled down upon me mr. Ohashi and
rinrin also found a really cool
head-to-toe pink outfit and I found
another blousy top that seemed to have
been made from like a college sweatshirt
they didn't think I would be here then
we grabbed a couple of bottoms to match
our tops including a black skirt for our
Nike outfit all the world
all black know I'm trying on other stuff
too well we have to have one all black a
day with the brand and a pair of
embellished jeans for our Central State
University blouse and with that we were
ready to start trying on our outfits
I'll be back I go did they like the
governador here
so first up was the head-to-toe pink
outfit yeah this look definitely had a
strong visual impact and I think that
the different shapes and textures were
really cool I like the little but apron
it's very different but I think it's fun
like nope don't look here then to top it
off mr. Ohashi styled me with a little
knit crown we've got a little like where
the wild things are situation I love it
like this oh it's so cute hahahaha and
despite how pink it was I actually
really liked it you look like you belong
in the store I'm never leaving but our
second outfit top some stiff competition
so I think that this is definitely like
more in line with like my personal style
I feel like the skirt I'm not sure what
I'm doing with it
despite the skirt being a little
unbalanced the top is amazing and as if
I needed any more convincing rinrin
decked me out with some accessories hey
how do I look after trying on both of
these looks I was kind of conflicted
because I feel like part of the style is
like what you like but I also feel like
maybe just because the other outfits
more different from what I usually wear
it feels more like the style you know
I'm saying transformation exactly a
style transformation yeah exactly but we
did have one more look to try on here it
is Central State University I thought
this top really accomplished the vintage
remake objective by transforming a
simple College t-shirt into a romantic
almost Renaissance II blouse it's like
sort of a Shakespearean in a way and I
really liked the jeans which featured
some nice real lace action though I
wouldn't say they were really
transformed into a different shape or
garment the jeans are like pretty normal
but embellished in terms of which outfit
I liked the best I was still torn
between the first and the second look I
thought the first one definitely made a
very big impact however I do think the
sec
it's very you so it looks good I think
we maybe want to change the bottom for
that one goes a bit short for balance
purpose so we purchased our bat outfit
thanked mr. Ohashi and were on our way
all right so now having explored the
vintage remix style a little bit you can
move on to our next location which is
ground lie ground why why is it not the
air no it's the ground so next up we
went to ground why to explore our second
Street fashion the mode style ground why
is an offshoot label by Yohji Yamamoto
located inside of the law for a
department store in Harajuku which has a
lot of local trendy designers and
boutiques now when you first walk into
ground why it's very black and white
which i think is in line with Yohji
Yamamoto s general vibe for reference
Yohji Yamamoto is a Japanese designer
described as a master tailor who is
known for his androgynous and
avant-garde designs usually made in
black sounds like my kind of guy
and in general he's considered an
important driver of the mode style so to
help pick out our mode outfit we met up
with rinrin's friend mika who is a mode
enthusiasts and Instagrammer
somos well I would say it's kind of
defined by a monotone color palette I
would say is very unisex or genderless
which is a very big thing going on right
now in general and I think that
androgynous vibe influences the shapes
and cuts of the clothing with most of
the outfits being unfinished flowy or
boxy yeah I always loose like simple
yeah like Oh simple and minimal
so with some sense of what we were
looking for it was time to start a
shoppin I'm still there always are you
doing this yes I do we do that yeah
ready we'll do it again my cousin like
sneaky sneaky so right from the start I
was a little confused by some of the
items at first glance they seem pretty
simple but when you approach them a lot
of them have unique cuts what's this
like an extra arm hole it's open so I
think it's just a flat okay
so the first outfit that rinrin and Myka
picked out was an asymmetric jacket a
white button-down shirt and a long pants
skirt hybrid ooh kind of like a suit
yeah next up we found a blue button-down
sheer dress oh we need an inner yeah too
sexy too sexy to see through which we D
sexified with like a matching blue shift
dress underneath and for our last option
this looks yeah I recommend this we went
for a white maxi shirt with a geometric
pattern on the right shoulder what would
you put underneath this like for pant um
no this button yeah just oh just like a
long dress yeah a long dress which gave
us three mode options to try on so first
up was our three-piece suit I like like
the asymmetry you enemy like it's kind
of like off center because mode style
pretty much ignores the curves of your
body the designs tend to play more with
draping asymmetry and abstract shapes
and to finish off the look Mika
recommended that we add this wide
brimmed hat oh yes oh wow I can hear
myself I'm like echoing off the Hat
overall I really enjoyed this outfit I'm
not usually a hat person but this look
made me feel kind of like a boxy Carmen
Sandiego
all right ready for the next one yes I
don't know if you're ready so up next
was our blue sheer dress
is this sufficiently D sexified yeah
you're so not thick fearing now perfect
that is the goal I feel like this was
more of a summer mode look I'm feeling
easy and breezy with the blueness and
with the lighter flowy or fabric rinrin
also thought that a backpack might suit
this outfit
so we tried on this very round one
turtle shell can I be a ninja turtle
movie Leonardo yeah the blue tinny
turtle oh there you go
this dress was definitely cute but I
just wasn't a hundred percent sold on it
so we went on to option number three oh
this looks nice yeah I love it
I almost this outfit combines elements
of the first and second look and there
was also a fun secret there are pockets
there means have everything yeah you're
a little going 1 2 I didn't notice
before
so we accessorized our long maxi shirt
to complete the look and though we all
liked this one I think we were kind of
missing some of that mousse from the
first look alright so I think that we've
decided that we're gonna kind of combine
the first and the third outfits by
putting this jacket over the last outfit
which I actually really like I think
this is like the best compromise because
it's like pretty much the vibe of the
first outfit except without the pants so
we went with our hybrid fourth option as
our mode outfit thank you so much mica
for helping us know you're on call so
what's next
we're gonna go to wall which is another
boutique inside of the same department
store it's right on the other side of
the wall I'm so sorry that I said no but
it's it's literally right next door all
right so let's go
so unlike ground Y and an in compute
capacity which focused more on a
singular trend or aesthetic wall carries
clothes from a range of designers that
reflect a few different trends the
concept of the store is Japan in ten
years it's also one of rinrin's favorite
stores and in fact the dress she's
wearing here is actually from wall but
what we were searching for was an outfit
that would exemplify what rinrin
described as the colorful layered trend
all right well let's get
to it yeah so one of the objectives of
this trend is to just wear a lot of
different garments basically piling on
ethnic cliff saket and oftentimes with
extra appliques or fabric stitched on -
or hanging off of the layered garments
would you even call this maybe they're
like nap yeah napkin flowers no Lotus
are more open I think you know I have no
idea yeah what are you orchids
we never did figure out what kind of
flower it is my best guess is a
campanula flower don't at me but
regardless we needed to find a bottom to
complete our first option oh my gosh
it's like pants but pants Wow they're
pants that have been written by other
pant extended pant and yes they are also
littered with embroidered mice I needed
to try them on
you've heard of Pizza rat have you heard
of thigh rats Pizza Pizza rats the rat
that like was dragging an entire piece
of pizza in the New York subway subway
yeah while shopping we also encountered
another aspect of the trend which is
that a lot of the items are loose and
oversized look at those sleeves it's not
quite a batwing it's almost like a
manatees flipper I'm not sure we could
in good conscience follow up the mice
pants with the manatee jacket but we did
find another oversized item this long
and patchworked
t-shirt oh you know what that looks like
a baggy 90's teenager yes almost like
the guys at Cher's high school in
clueless and to pair with it we grabbed
some also patchworked jeans and for our
third option we wanted to try something
that was a little more vibrant to make
sure we got to the colorful part of the
colorful layered look oh that's really
cute I like the pink but I want to layer
something over it of course we must we
must
so rinrin grabbed this dusty rose slip
from off of another hanger we couldn't
find another layering piece so we're
just done for DIY yes and with that
completing our third outfit we began
attacking our pile of clothes
I love the rats more than I thought I
would if you can take a second to not
look at the extended Mouse pants rinrin
and i also really liked the top it's
very spring I'm a blooming flower and
though I'll say I did enjoy the rats I
think it just overpowered the other
layers too much it's not called the
colorful rat trend so we moved on to our
90s high school boy outfit there we go I
was surprised by how much I liked this
look for some reason I feel like pretty
comfortable in it that might be because
it's a giant t-shirt but I feel like
pretty like yeah like that I can wear
this around this was also a big hit with
the shop staff at wall who suggested we
accessorize it with a bold graphic
earring though we were feeling pretty
good about this outfit we still wanted
to try our last one on for good measure
which actually turned out to be no easy
feat it took me so long to get into this
rinrin like came off like a harem I like
had to help me do this what I will say
about this outfit is that the undershirt
skirt thing is super cool and I love the
sleeves yeah but I think that the over
layer is like a little tight for my
booty
oh no sexy which I don't think is the
vibe we're going for as we mentioned
with the layered trend you usually want
things to be oversized and flowy and
though I think we had the right idea
with the layering unfortunately those
ideas were just eclipsed by the booty so
we decided to go with a little bit of a
mash-up for our final look alright I
think we nailed it
so this is the second outfit with the
jacket from the first outfit on top of
it I think this kind of brings
everything that we liked from the second
outfit and then just adds another layer
on top of it what do you say I think
this is the perfect one so with rinrin's
approval we got to our final tokyo
street fashion outfit so now we have
three outfits that embody like three
different tokyo street styles but we
don't have any of the finishing touches
like the makeup or the shoes
and stuff we're gonna do a little um
exploring and see what we can find and
then we'll see our finished looks for a
quick shoe stop we dropped by a store
called Tokyo Bopper to pick up a pair of
stumpy shoes to pair with the mode
outfit and the next day we went with
rinrin to a drugstore to grab a couple
of products to put together a Tokyo
inspired makeup look so what I wanted to
incorporate this time is a trendy like
pop of color since we're heading into
summer the focus of this makeup look is
definitely the eyes as we added some
highlighter to the lower lids to make
them look bigger and used some turquoise
liner for that pop of color that rinrin
had been joined so you already have that
droopy eye look which is an ideal look
here's to bring your eyes down it looks
like your kinder oh that's a very nice
thing to say thank you we also applied
some cream blush on my cheekbones and
under eyes I'm hoping the cream blush
will like bring in that to eNOS
since dewy skin is a popular goal in a
lot of Japanese makeup looks and then
with a dash of semi-sheer lipstick you
were ready to go but this is definitely
a summer look I'm not gonna say like
this is like the general like Tokyo
Street fashion look
do I look summer II like a sweet summer
child yeah so the first Street fashion
look we took out on the town was the
vintage to remake outfit which included
our remade batwing Nike top these
fluttery adidas pants the pants have
some Flair in fact they've got multiple
flares and a pair of black combat boots
that I had brought from home on my face
I was rocking our pop of color summer
makeup look and for my hair rinrin had
gone ham with some bobby pins the
sideburn unwhole display so for this
first outfit rinrin was able to come out
vlogging with us for a bit you guys are
the bat twins right now so she could
help us take Street snap or style photos
of the outfit I don't get hits up in
Harajuku photographers will line up on
the Main Street and to ask passerby who
they think have cool outfits on to take
photos of them hence streets now
seeking Street snaps of me and Richard
together and there was like a dude
almost
it's just posh as hell all the time I
think that overall this is probably my
favorite outfit it's definitely like
more shapeless than I would usually go
but besides that like it's pretty up my
alley
I'm not usually one to wear Nike
Sportswear but that's because they tend
to not have giant bat wings attached so
in this case the vintage remake style
has bridged that gap for me
you look so dramatic but comfortable at
the same time this is comfortable
vampire I may have also felt at home in
this outfit because it reminded me of
some of the unusual clothing items we've
tried in the past this outfit is kind of
like if the band ruffled t-shirt and the
Y project like long-sleeve denim jacket
had a lovechild I think it captures a
lot of the fun of the giant 4-foot
sleeves without the added danger of
hitting someone with a large denim tube
the only real obstacle I could think of
with this outfit was that because
there's a lot of stuff hanging off of it
it feels like you could accidentally dip
it right into your food or drink
I think we did okay with our ramen this
time but it's definitely something to
look out for so next up was our mood
look I'm a mode Gargoyle
excel like a nova babe for mode hashtag
mode gargoyle for the completed outfit I
donned our white maxi shirt asymmetric
jacket wide brimmed hat and these shoes
that we got a Tokyo Bopper for my makeup
I substituted the pop of color out for
some plain black eyeliner though I kept
to the cheeks flushed rinrin also
suggested that we could slick my hair
back for this outfit but my hair has to
be curled for the wall outfit and
there's only one time that the
hairstylist could take me in so it's
currently even though this look is color
wise definitely in my zone I would say
that it's much more formal and
structured than I would usually go I
feel kind of like a business casual
Dementor but nonetheless there was
something theatrical about it that I
loved in particular the Hat was like the
best prop part of you is bird-like yeah
and it kind of gave me a personal cave
under which I could perform my mischief
come under the brim
like there oh my god here I will say it
was a little sweaty probably since it
was late made but the no-pants aspect
made it bearable at least so I've got
Swamp bra but not swamp butt but despite
any swamp enos I actually enjoyed
wearing and vlogging in this outfit the
most maybe even though I wouldn't wear
this entire outfit together in the u.s.
I might wear this entire outfit together
in the u.s. you should
and our final street fashion look was
our colorful layered outfit from wall
which included our oversized t-shirt
patchwork jeans and yellow unknown
flower jacket so for this outfit rinrin
recommended that we accessorize it with
white sneakers that i have brought from
home actually because my feet are rather
large for japanese sizes these orange
earrings that we also got at wall at la
foret and some curly hair I also subbed
in some yellow eyeliner to match our
jacket now for all three of these
outfits we were vlogging in the same
area of Harajuku which happened to be
just a few subway stops away from our
hotel so we kept going there because we
knew how to get there so I think that
this outfit matches the aesthetics of
the hard Juhu neighborhood itself the
most closely like with this giant teddy
bear now that is some seriously around
and this amazingly huge multi-colored
ice cream I think as is getting more
melty I think we should get that away
from the layered clothing though this
outfit is definitely the furthest away
from my usual style and not just because
of the color but also because of the
silhouette and texture yeah though I
didn't mind being a moving pile of
laundry and like how it flows if I mean
I
weirdly like this sort of like guilt at
the bottom yeah the half kilt the only
thing I didn't really like about the
layered look was the effect that the
layers had on my body temperature as in
I was warm warmer than I was even in my
full-on mode suit but there's a nice
breeze coming down this alley yeah kind
of like opening up the air ducts I had
to fight the inclination to take off
some of the layers it's supposed to be
the colorful layered look so I had to
stay layered but I think that for more
everyday wear I'll probably dawn these
items separately as I like them all
individually
specifically I love with pants which you
can barely see yeah all right so those
were my Tokyo Street fashion looks even
though these outfits are supposed to
represent three different trends there
are some commonalities between them that
are kind of emblematic of Tokyo fashion
in general all of them are sort of like
long and in general I'm pretty like
covered just to provide I guess like
maximum area for more layering and
they're all also kind of asymmetric this
one is a little sort of half kilt and
all the other ones have their own little
asymmetric Flair's I think that all
three of these outfits are pretty
different from current US fashion trends
at least the ones I'm aware of and
rinrin seems to be right in that there's
more of an emphasis on layering and
draping and the clothes seem to skew a
bit looser overall though regardless I'm
excited to bring these looks back to the
u.s. because I feel like I can
incorporate different items from them
into my own wardrobe and in some cases
just wear them head to toe exactly as is
we're going to make mode gargoyle I
think if it's the last thing I do thank
you guys so much for watching and a big
