hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm gonna let my subscribers
a que you guys pick my hair color so
there's a few things going on here first
off I've never dyed my hair before ever
but I'd like to do it at least once in
my life and secondly last year I ended
up growing my hair out because I was
doing a bunch of decades fashion videos
and I wanted my hair to be lengthy for
the 60s and the 70s so at this point
I've got really long hair and I want to
dye it at some point so I feel like I
should do it now because I've got all
this extra space to play and if I'm
gonna cut it off eventually why not have
a little fun finally I thought it would
be cool to do some type of interactive
video as a thank you to you guys for 4
million subscribers but over the last
couple of weeks I haven't been able to
dye my hair so let's do it now to decide
the hair color I put up a couple of
different polls on YouTube and Twitter
prompting you to choose from a selection
of colors all of which I'm open to and
all of which are also in like an ombre
or balayage style I can never say that
word I always say biologics balayage
balayage vampires none of those are
correct I'm sure so the first option on
the poll is a natural ombre look it's
kind of like a lighter brown or caramel
color I feel like in an alternate
universe where I'm a contestant on The
Bachelor my hair looks like this option
number two is a gray ombre style kind of
inspired by the fact that I'm starting
to sprout a few gray hairs here and
there and it's also kind of inspired by
Jade Thirlwall of little mixes
previously grey hairs I just feel like
this would be a cool way to embrace my
graying scalp option number three is a
blue ombre which is kind of like
ravenclaw inspired I'm not gonna lie I'm
a little bit nervous about how the blue
would fade out but I also think that at
first the blue would be like really cool
and kind of subtle and option four is a
lavender ombre I've seen this look
really cool on other people and it's
kind of like a different take on the
so I just threw it into the mix so up
until this point to keep everything a
surprise
I have not reviewed the results of the
polls in fact I'm gonna have Tyler go in
and compile the raw numbers of the
results from the Twitter poll and the
YouTube video poll and from those
numbers he's gonna tell the hair stylist
which color she should dye my hair and
I'm gonna find out your guys's choice in
the salon when it's done all right let's
do it
good morning it's decently early in the
morning well early for us it's around 8
a.m. and we're heading to the hair salon
right now to get my hair dyed but
because I'm changing my hair today we
ended up filming a lot of stuff late
into the night last night because I
didn't want like for my hair to randomly
change in the middle of videos which
it's definitely still gonna do like I
feel like for the next like three videos
I'm just gonna like have black hair in
the beginning and then halfway through
have mystery hair mystery here did I
don't know yet but I know so I'm excited
to see what happens and basically
everyone knows but me so we were
recommended by a friend to go to Natalie
at the this or dye hair salon in Atwater
Village everyone say hi Natalie
hi we had sent her images of all of our
options and then Tyler had called ahead
to tell her which one one do you always
pull your hair on this side yes usually
right here okay do you want layers at
all maybe I mean sometimes I feel like
that shows off the color yeah I'm down
for layers I feel like I just don't to
take too much length off because my
safety plan is if I freak out and I
don't like it then I'm just gonna cut it
off okay not immediately you know not
like today but you know down the line
right given that I had never dyed my
hair before I was a little nervous
especially about the bleaching I've
heard bad things and I've seen bad
things so you're thinking you want to
keep the ombre starting a little bit
lower yeah maybe like a little bit more
like ba-bling okay alright it's actually
better that you've never colored your
hair it's gonna make my job a lot easier
are you ready yeah I'm ready okay cool
let me go mix up I'll be right back so
Natalie said that since I had a virgin
hair we were going to be able to do all
of the bleaching and
in one session and she pretty much got
straight down to business first she
started by teasing my hair and then
adding bleach to the ends did you warn
your friends and family that you're
doing this no no my mom's gonna have a
heart attack is that gonna happen are
you gonna do a tattoo well if I hit 5
million subs maybe I'll let them pick my
tattoo next because after that what do
you do choose which finger to lose this
teasing technique was to make the
transition between my hair and the color
more of a gradient rather than a harsh
line the vibe was definitely like a
aluminum Beetlejuice you know my
initials SN do stand for the element tin
this is destiny that my entire life has
led up to this moment as this was
happening the reality of what we were
doing started to set in but once the
bleach was on there was really no
turning back okay so you can see the
color is lifting really nice oh wow
right oh whoa what's going on back there
oh it's good so it's cream already it's
already great pretty green shop which
was a different color so once she had
fully foiled me she put me inside her
warm alien pod aka underneath the blow
dryer where are you taking me I feel
like for most people watching who have
gotten their hair done before they're
gonna be like you're an idiot but for me
it was a new experience and yes the last
time I stepped into a hair salon was
2016 I think I've reached full Chipotle
burrito
do this in foil yeah based on the way
they look inside it's almost like a
half-eaten taco hair tacos Cariocas that
sounds like something else Natalie it
was very keen on not letting me know the
color and actually was like throwing out
some misdirections it looks blue that
could be the bleach that could be the
color we don't know yet know is really
selling this yeah Natalie Savage some of
my tacos were ready to be unshelled so
we made a few trips back and forth from
the alien pod to the sink Oh like a
rat's nest back there it's like a rat
king and back again I kind of look like
a founding father with bedhead unlike
John Adams and I
up in my curls or kind of just ask you
I'm like Abigail advocate and a couple
of my gray hair is made an appearance is
that bleached in there is that a gray
popping up for stuff not to bleed it's
bleach I don't see any gray is on your
head oh really yeah there's one or two
sometimes Tyler will trim them if he
spots them so we rinsed and we toned
okay see how it's starting to turn
purpley is that the color saw oh it is
purple a lot of leading words being said
it could be throwing you off though or
trying to throw you off and then Natalie
and I tried to convince Tyler to perm
his hair oh oh you had a success perm no
you actually get a perm you yeah oh
definitely there's actually a look right
now it's like kind of a perm just for
it's a boys cut and it's called meet me
at McDonald's it's like short on the
sides and really curly on top Tyler when
your channel hits a million subs you're
gonna get a meeting at McDonald's and
you're gonna get a perm you mean if if
it hits a million subs I just hope this
doesn't turn into another mustache
situation where I like it but no one
else does everyone's seen it now so
that's appealing to you I guess
subscribe to my channel so after rinsing
out all of the toner I was allowed to
see myself in all of my bleached glory
we've got the first toner done okay
you're gonna dry you should I look now
if you want you can look now
yeah tada you're done I'm like a
man-of-war jellyfish yeah I've got like
a mass and I've got tentacles so Natalie
and Tyler went into the back to mix up
the dyes and then it was time to put it
on my head okay so I'm starting oh if
that's happening
Natalie turned me around to make sure
that I couldn't see anything and then
when she like got closer to my
peripheral vision I just closed my eyes
if I wash my hair after a perm it goes
away right no not if it's a permanent
problem wasn't that the plot point and
Legally Blonde
you can ruin the curls if you wash it
too soon that's true how long's just say
four until it grows out yeah I think you
should actually do this
to begin you know once the dye was all
in they put me under a towel I live like
an Amish lady hmm how do you solve a
problem like money yeah sound of music
no none underneath here is my subscriber
hair color right now it's just like a
giant dreadlock okay it's looking good
all right is it time I think it's time
are you ready wait what are we doing
next we're gonna rinse down and then
Natalie brushed out my nest gave me a
quick trim and a couple of layers
I feel the hair dropping on my hands Oh
actually be careful not to look at what
drops okay I'm gonna start the blow-dry
all right I don't know where anyone is
but we're blow-drying it was around this
time that I decided to take a nap it was
warm I was being brushed I just I felt
like no one would miss me
actually a little bit it's very relaxing
yeah and once I awoke it was time for
the reveal
so the final results of the poll were 4%
or 16,000 votes for natural hombre 14%
or 48,000 votes for the blue hombre
apparently you're all slytherins 38% or
a hundred and twenty-nine thousand votes
for lavender ombre and then with
forty-four percent or a hundred and
fifty thousand votes the gray ombre
which is now on my head okay guys well
at first I couldn't quite see anything
because it was kind of like a dark steel
color Oh is it blue oh it's the gray
it's brighter if it was the babe whoa oh
that looks cool what do you think oh I
look like a Disney villain mummy it is a
little villainy Natalie said she had
made it a bit darker at first so to have
a longer lifespan and fade out over time
to that lighter gray from the photos
awesome thank you so much Natalie this
looks so great I look so fun so happy to
do this this was really fun I liked the
big surprise and like I said I think
this color is perfect for you it's not
too shocking I feel like my first time
you know I kind of get my feet wet I
love it cuz it's kind of like cool tone
like I'm just like a little more evil
than before overall I'm very happy with
this hair color I think you guys did a
great job choosing you match the wall
behind you can you see it in the light
oh yeah I mean I'll go full ring girl to
show you it's like steel hair yeah blue
steel as I said before I liked all of
the options but maybe I was a little bit
partial to the gray because of my own
graying head now you can't even tell if
there's gray hairs on my head if it's on
purpose or if I'm just old L'Oreal
because I'm aging it's now been a few
days and a few washes since I dyed it
and I think Natalie was right that it is
fading out now to look a little bit
lighter gray like the photos Natalie
mentioned that once the color fades out
it'll turn like a platinum blonde at
which point I thought that I would just
want to chop it off and have shorter
hair but I feel like I might just want
to go back to her and ask for the same
thing because I really liked that
original dark metallic color that kind
had the like is it died or is it not
died vibe but as Natalie said
paraphrased once you pop the fun don't
stop so we could just try out any of the
other colors that you guys didn't like
as much thank you guys so much for
