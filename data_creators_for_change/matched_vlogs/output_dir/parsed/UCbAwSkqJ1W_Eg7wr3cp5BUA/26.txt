hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm gonna be buying a full
face of makeup from facebook ads now
I've bought things from Facebook and
Instagram ads before to test how well
their algorithms match sponsored posts
to me as a consumer as well as to see if
the products recommended to me are
actually any good so I decided to do it
again but this time focusing
specifically on makeup I notice a lot of
makeup and beauty ads on my Facebook
feed sometimes for companies that I know
but a lot of times for companies and
products that I've never heard of before
so I'm gonna be buying the products from
these ads to collect a full faces worth
of makeup and to keep the experiment
focused on Facebook's recommendations
I'm gonna buy the first item of each
category that I find now I've been on
Facebook since 2006 so they've had a lot
of time to gather information about me
and even though I don't post on my
personal Facebook page that much anymore
I use Instagram pretty often and I do
follow a decent amount of makeup brands
on there so Facebook does have some
information on what makeup companies and
styles I like based on my activity
within the Facebook family all right
let's start combing for ads okay so I
found our first makeup item for our full
face I came across this sponsored post
for thrive cosmetics cause spelled like
a cause I'm fighting for and it looks
like they're advertising to meet a
long-lasting nude metallic eyeshadow
quad there seem to be in a couple
different color combos but the one that
is in the ad is like white copper black
and brown so let's get that one eye
shadow let's shake all right so it's
about an hour later after I bought my
eye shadow quad and the good thing about
Facebook ads at least for my purposes is
that once you bite they start popping up
more so I now have an ad for a concealer
from wander Beauty it says you'll never
need to reach for another concealer for
the rest of your life damn I'm just
gonna click shop now shop now I say I am
always a little nervous about buying
concealer online just because of the
color issue the first one is called fair
I don't think I'm fair the second one's
called light I could be light you know
what it's winter I'm gonna guess white
okay it's a couple days after those
first couple of items and I found two
more makeup items on my facebook feed
just now so this first item that I found
is Wonder - hi-tech beauty Wonder brow
I've actually heard about this product
before and I've seen this specific brand
on my Facebook feed a lot before
actually over the past few months so I'm
glad that we got it it seems to be some
type of like brow gel it says get
perfect brows in one step that will last
for days these wait days what is this
thing wait days so that should be
interesting alright so I'm getting this
my wonder brow and free dual brush combo
in jet black and then this is the second
product that I found on my feet today I
found an extreme coverage foundation
it's from Gere just for you calm it says
this makeup liquid foundation concealer
works like magic they like to show all
these like really intense videos of
people covering up their tattoos and
like wearing it underwater so I say
let's get it
it says powerful waterproof formula
covers everything primer highlighter
professional contouring makeup derma
call concealer cream why do I feel like
we're on wish all right so I'm going to
look through the shades and see what the
possibilities are
I'm gonna go with color number 211 cross
your fingers so it's a few days later
and I found two more ads so first off is
this ad for liquid highlighters from
Piper house
so this says these liquid highlighters
have me shook shine bright like a
diamond
get your highlighters here like and
share if you want the look so seems like
we shall be shining to the gods is that
the saying highlighted to the heavens
I've got a few different colors so let's
scroll through these and see which one I
should get halo was the first option
when I kinda
like scrolled in here so I am going to
add this hallo to Cart and then we're
gonna check out so the second product I
found is this eyeliner bifocal lure
beauty
it says stay goodbye to dull and dirty
smudges around your eyes and get this
feather cushion pen eyeliner make your
eyeliner flawless salsa dance a girl
three times I just realized it probably
would have been interesting to see this
for all the products I bought so far but
I just thought of it I clicked on the
little three dots in the corner and
looked at the why am I seeing this
option which you can do on Facebook ads
and it basically says that focal or
beauty wants to reach people interested
in beauty and also women ages 24 and
older who live in the United States
alright so let's get this feather
cushion pen eyeliner for twenty dollars
so on this why am I seeing this ad page
they give you a couple of cursory
reasons as to why you might be in this
company's ad demographic for almost all
of these companies they said that they
showed me this ad because I'm interested
in beauty I'm over 18 and I live in the
United States but if you look at the
options provided to brands when they're
making a facebook ad you'll see there's
a lot more specificity to it besides
just age location and general interest
there's a lot more about purchasing
behavior internet activity off of
Facebook and what mailing lists and
rewards cards you've signed up for
amongst other things so it's kind of
nice that they provide you this page but
I'm pretty sure it's not telling you the
whole story okay just checking in to let
you guys know that I just bought a
lipstick from Facebook probably about 30
minutes ago when I was uh waiting on the
street I saw an ad pop up for a product
that I'd already seen before and I
didn't want to let it get away this time
so I bought it right then and there on
the website basically it said that it
was a three piece lip kit bifocal or
which is the same company that we got
the eye liner from there were a bunch of
different options for color combos but I
chose the lip Skitch 3 just because this
color number 16 Del Rio and number 17
studded kiss looks good to me
so I went with sort of like the plumy
pinks I'm gonna call it okay so this is
an
from Tyra beauty yes as in Tyra Banks of
ANTM Fame it says get huge lashes sexy
smoky smize and so much more at tyra
beauty introducing smack my fat lash
smack my fat lash mascara is what it's
called what a name
they say that tyra beauty wants to reach
people interested in mac cosmetics but i
don't usually click on things relating
to mac cosmetics and also we just
started rewatching America's Next Top
Model like two days ago so maybe they
saw that I was watching an auntie em on
Hulu or maybe they were listening in
alright so the link takes me to this
page on Tyra Beauty called rise and
smize and they smack my fat lash is
pretty front and center so with the
discount you get $4.00 off so I'm paying
$21.95 for my Tyra Banks mascara alright
so this may be the last item for our
full face of makeup so this is the
Charlotte Tilbury film-star bronze and
blush this is that must be Charlotte
Tilbury herself she sounded like a Spice
Girl
alright so I'm gonna click shop now oh
my god it's $75 it's been sort of hard
to find an ad for blush and contour so I
think we should fight the bullet on this
one and get it but 75 Wow
so that is bronzer and blush and the
next time you see me I'll have my full
face of Facebook makeup see you then
okay
so it's been a couple of months and I
think I finally have all of my facebook
makeup items here I think we should put
them on in the order that I usually put
on my makeup so let's start with the
brows here is our route to high tech
Beauty perfect eyebrows that last for
days with perma fix technology alright
so the instructions basically safe to
apply the wound Dubrow directly to your
eyebrow with an angled brush or with the
applicator look at that looks like a lip
gloss brush
oh that's dark and smooth alright so I'm
gonna grab an angled brush and then
let's put this on my face oh oh oh no it
might look like a gel but it feels to me
much more like a very thin
match liquid lipstick it definitely is a
dramatic eyebrow you know it's
definitely like my eyebrows are also
like getting kind of matted down with it
yeah I think that by perma fix
technology they may have meant food all
right I think I'm gonna call my brows
done for now I almost expected with like
a three day brow product for it to
almost feel like a tattoo but these feel
way more like a crunchy hair gel all
right so next up is eyeshadow and for
eyeshadow we have our thrive Cosmetics
eyeshadow quad ooh
so they basically already have
directions in here as to like how I
should apply this quad why is it one two
four three just to make it more
confusing also how do I get in here I
thought it was gonna open like a pizza
box but it's not oh now this is a cute
compact I will say all right so I'm
gonna go in with number one and put that
all over my lid I will say that even
though these shades are pretty normal
and neutral they are very much making
their presence known I think maybe they
heard that the eyebrows were really
bringing it so they were like hey watch
out oh hello I'm just gonna put a dash
of that on the other side and then blend
it out honestly is it even possible to
blend with your mouth closed
a question I asked to the scientists out
there all right so I think I've executed
the eye shadow look that they suggested
to me moderately well I actually think
that these eye shadows are pretty
pigmented I just wish that one of the
colors was matte especially in something
that's supposed to be like an everyday
neutral eyeshadow palette I just feel
like at this point like it's a lot of
shimmer so next up is Foundation and
concealer aka the complexion products so
here is the derma call oh it smells very
strong it smells like a 90s plastic
McDonald's toy and the seal is also a
metal that you have to pierce oh that's
like a hardcore fungus medicine let's
get the concealer out here because I
know that it's crazy but I usually do my
concealer first so I think on one side
we have like a stick and then on the
other side we have a liquid concealer
all right so I'm gonna go in with the
concealer under my eyes first mmm
that'll actually looks like a pretty
good concealer color all right now I'm
gonna take the lipstick side and put it
on a couple little zitties I don't know
about only
you'll ever need in your life but it's
blending out pretty nicely to be honest
it's just kind of a like your skin but
better type of concealer I think that
it's a very different vibe from what I
expect the foundation to be because this
is really how natural all right so now
that we've mildly brightened up the
purpley parts of my face I think we
should just slather some of this on and
cover it all up Oh
oh my god it's coming out oh it's slowly
snaking its way out oh my god it was
like pressurized in there all right so
this is color 211 and it doesn't look
wrong but it definitely looks pretty
pinky honestly it feels like a Nivea
body butter the box smelled insane but
this barely smells at all alright ready
I'm gonna put some dots on my face and
then blend it out it looks like it's
gonna be a little bit pale especially if
it's like completely full coverage but
it's not a terrible match do you have
chicken pox oh yeah like I'm covering
them all with calamine this is a very
interesting foundation it's not letting
a lot of like my natural color shine
through but at the same time I feel like
it doesn't look that intensely full
coverage it almost just looks like I'm
wearing like really intense sunscreen
yeah I'm just looking like very shiny
and pale I am glad that it doesn't smell
though because the box
reeks all right so we've got a few
things to do next
first off I'm gonna like bake my
under-eye area as well as a few other
areas on my face with powder and then
I'm gonna make an eyeliner wing template
with my concealer so eyeliner is up next
this eyeliner looks kind of like a
child's toy version of a quill pen
alright so I'm going to press the brush
into the cushion oh wow that got covered
real quick then I guess I'm gonna take
it up to my eye I'm not really sure what
the advantage is of this I think it's
like it supposed to last really long
like in the ad they were like washing
their hands that had eyeliner on it
the ink dries fast though this is not
giving me a lot of time to work the
things I like about this inked cushion
gel liner is the cuteness
I like the Shakespeare / Harry Potter
vibes I get from holding a quill in my
hand besides that I don't think I would
choose to use this eyeliner again after
like the first few swipes I found it
really hard to get pigment off of the
brush and onto my eye it felt like the
brush was dry no matter how many times I
dipped it into the cushion so I think
that I ended up somewhere okay but it
took me a while all right so now that my
eyeliner is done I think we should dive
into our $75 bronzer and blush duo it's
smaller than I thought it would be from
this big ol box it looks very beautiful
but they both look kind of pearlescent
and the bronzer is kind of light so I
guess we'll see how well this contours
me all right so I'm gonna use my
contouring brush gonna suck in my cheeks
like a fish and go into town just trying
to contour away my double chin it's
working no it's not I'm gonna get
something that blush on there and a
smile and get some on the apples of my
cheeks the blush is quite pigmented it's
frustrating because it does actually
look nice I I do see the sort of like
natural soft contour and a little bit of
rosiness and the cheeks but $75 for
bronzer and blush
I don't know Charlotte I just don't know
so next up we're gonna do my highlighter
which is in the color halo which I
thought was more like a purpley shade
but this packaging is very copper oh but
inside it's like white it looks like
they wanted to call it Hollow they knew
better not to lest the wrath of
Christine rain down upon them it looks a
little bit unfortunately like glitter
glue oh I feel like they just put
sparkles in oil I feel like that's what
this is all right so I'm gonna put a
little bit with my finger on my
cheekbones and like on my Cupid's bow
I'm not sure about this one you guys
it's like definitely not a blinding
highlight and it's kind of just like
chilling the girls in the facebook ad
were like dropping this stuff all over
their faces and it looked
honestly like liquid gold and right now
it looks just like a little bit of oil I
just I put some Pam on my face okay so
we're almost done with our full face I
think so far it's been kind of an
emotional roller coaster so you know I'm
interested to see how Tyra measures up
and even honestly if it's bad I'll
probably still love Tyra for the rest of
my life
she's a magnificent woman with some
magnificent pranks and this must be the
smack my fat lash
Beckett ooh like smash smack it I mean
honestly I'm kind of hyped for this so I
want to see how it is all right so this
says most mascaras lengthen or thicken
but smack my fat lash does both this
dual formula fuses blue volumizing and
black extension technologies to create
the fiercest black it looks nice and
separated they're almost like very
skinny but defined lashes is what I
would say wouldn't call them a fat lash
but for my first encounter with Tyra
Beauty I'm okay with it I would use it
again especially since I've bought it
already so finally here's the lips kit
they're like three pretty small lip
pencils
so let's swatch all three and then I'll
see which one is my favorite and put
that one on alright this one's number 16
number 18 and then this is number 17
these don't look quite like what I
expected from the website I think of
these three my favorite color is number
17 which is the more hearty color a
little minestrone
oh that looks way more like fuchsia on
the lips online and on the box it looked
a lot darker and like more dusty I think
I'm missing like the dust all right it
does seem to be making my teeth look
white which is nice and I think there is
a decent amount of initial butthole
coverage and by that I mean coverage on
the inner waterline of my lips so I'm
decently pleased with it especially with
how it like feels and seems like it's
covering the mouth but I think the color
was the biggest surprise to me I wish it
was slightly different alright so we
finally completed my full face of makeup
from facebook ads and now that it's all
on I'm just gonna wear it around for a
couple of hours a lot of these items say
that they're supposed to be like really
long wearing so we'll see if that's true
over the next few hours
alright so this is my makeup after about
seven hours I think that the foundation
in general isn't staying super matte and
if you guys remember like when I first
put my foundation on the derma call was
pretty shiny so I think I'm returning to
that original shiny state but I think
that my eyeshadow my eyeliner my mascara
even my under eye concealer is looking
pretty good still my butthole is exposed
you know it's more of an ombre lip now
but there is still some lipstick hanging
on for dear
the products that I liked and would use
again are the concealer the eyeshadow
the mascara and the bronzer blush duo
the things that I did not like and
probably wouldn't use again are the
foundation the eyeliner and the
highlighter I think that leaves the
lipstick and the eyebrows which are sort
of in the middle for me the eyebrows are
obviously very dark and bold but I'm
withholding judgment until I see what
they look like
in three days so overall of all of these
products I think the only one that
seemed like it was super targeted to me
and my interests was the tyra beauty
mascara I think that most of the other
ads seem just sort of generally targeted
at women who are interested in makeup
but I will say with the tyra beauty if
they watched me watch America's Next Top
Model it's a little creepy but it's
clever and that's a tree Tyra prank or
should I say a Zuckerberg prank thank
