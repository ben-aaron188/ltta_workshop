hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm gonna be mixing all of
my highlighters together into one giant
hopefully dazzling mega highlighter so
I've previously mixed some of my makeup
before including all of my nude
lipsticks my foundations my eyeshadows
and my liquid lipsticks and I would say
I've been overall surprised by how well
they each turned out but beyond there
being a lot of requests for this
particular Franken product I'm curious
to see just what will come out of this
now I don't normally wear highlighter on
a daily basis because I'm a pretty oily
person so I generate my own sheen
throughout the day but when I go full
glam and do wear highlighter it better
be full-on nikkietutorials burning out
your retinas shiny so hopefully mixing
all of the powers of my highlighters
together will achieve that also a big
THANK YOU to Olay and Olay daily facials
for sponsoring this video did you like
that smooth from under the table lifts
after many bad makeup science
experiments we somehow got sponsored I
think they may have seen just how many
makeup wipes we've used over the course
of the series and decided they needed to
step in and help so I have their
pre-moistened wipes that we're gonna use
as our surgeons rags throughout the
mixing portion of the video and I'll
show you guys how to take off your
makeup with these dry cloths later on
but first to the scraping let's bring
out those highlighters shall we for
someone who doesn't wear a lot of
highlighters I do have a lot of
highlighters here so I'm gonna try and
get a little sampling of each
highlighter using this scalpel here to
just scrape off a tiny bit into the same
pan and then at the end once I've done
that to all of my highlighters I'll use
this makeup repairing loose to try and
set it all down and turn it into a
usable highlighter I also have these two
sheets of paper one is for a fan
suggestion to put a piece of paper
underneath where I'm like pouring things
so at the end I don't have to just like
wipe all the extra casualties away I can
just pour it in and also
one for swatching although I feel likes
watching highlighters on a piece of
paper doesn't really allow you to see
the highlighter in its full glory
because it looks best on skin so I'm
also gonna be swatching them all on my
face alright I'm done talking now let's
let's start scraping alright so let's
begin with this one which I wear a
decent amount this is the Becca
shimmering skin Perfector in opal I feel
like I have a decent amount of
highlighters that are this tan rosy
color that are supposed to just be like
a little bit of shine on your face but I
do have some more odd ones like purple
rainbow green glow-in-the-dark that will
get to last
alright let's scrape oh yeah that's a
soft one yeah it's very velvety she's
lifting right up it's upsetting
alright let's dump this one in that's a
decent amount actually doesn't look like
we've harmed it too horribly and now
I've got a lot on my finger perfect cuz
I got a swatch it on the face
that's highlighter yeah that's a good
effect alright so I'm gonna grab all of
my like natural like nudie highlighters
and do those first husbands bulbous it's
like a little boob ish creating a nice
little areal amount are we gonna get
demonetised for that actually this one's
pretty tough I feel like you could
almost play this one like a drum you
know those videos that like play all
star on a thick cat for example all that
glitters is gold it was meant to be oh
this one has an engraving of a cute
flower that hasn't been destroyed yet
should I kill the designer that's too
sad I'm gonna create my own design I was
an agreeable heart oh that's a butt
heart we've got another one I'm gonna
try and make a star this time it's like
the highlighter color of like Patrick
from SpongeBob this is full glam Patrick
the inner machinations of my mind or and
a neutral
here we can mess up the design on these
ones cuz I don't think there's any space
for us to do any freestyle that's the
most satisfying one yet it looks like
some some spices got cinnamon some sugar
some other spices all right so we're
nearing the end of the nudie ones and
I'm making some good progress on my face
you're like beige Rudolph oh I do kind
of look like a deranged reindeer I think
one of the last nudie ones is this one
from 7-eleven so it's got like two
different sides so let's do them both
and see if we can't cascade them in it
kind of looks like someone powdered up
tums
the only good tongues are the mint ones
don't add me I'm gonna double swatch
this guy cuz it's got two sides I was
about to call you miss that's not okay
alright so I think that concludes the
normal highlighter portion of this
evening let's move on to the weird ones
shall we look at that paper shine
staples is quaking alright let's start
with these ones we've got purple and red
and orange
I call this Charizard cheeks and this
icy blue one if the last one was
Charizard cheeks
this is Elsa's buttocks okay so next up
we're gonna blow through a couple like
these salt and pepper shaker ones and
this one that says it's Hollow
but it's not really I think I should
just complete my facial hair and make a
highlighter mustache highlighting the
Cupid's bow key you know what it kind of
works alright so this next one is very
glittery this is the aurora glow kit by
uh Nastasia beverly hills i don't think
we should do this palette kind of like
how we did the eyeshadows where we do a
bunch of them in the row and then kind
of cascade them in alright so this next
one is a palette from huda beauty which
Tyler calls hooter booty it is much
easier to say than huda beauty booties
oh oh it's a magnetic palette it is
taking my scalpel with it I wasn't
expecting that who didn't let me know
okay so we're nearing the homestretch I
have five left in here so let's start
with these rainbows now I never know
what these rainbow highlighters if
you're supposed to apply it like a
rainbow or like mix them all together on
your brush and then apply them so um
yeah I think we should just carve right
down the middle and why don't we put
this one like right between my eyebrows
like a little unibrow oh that's
it's actually that's actually a nice
highlighter highlighter and yoonah brows
sounds like it could be an Instagram
trend to be honest all right so we've
got two highlighters left one of which
is the famed Fenty Beauty trophy wife
highlighter this is a little painful but
this is gonna bring some serious sparkle
to our concoction it's a sacrifice for
science I'm not saying that Rihanna
would understand but maybe she would you
know I've spent about an hour and a half
putting highlighter on places that there
definitely shouldn't be highlighter and
I haven't highlighter under my brow bone
so let's put some there so last up is
this glow-in-the-dark highlighter I
wonder how much of this we would have to
put in for our concoction to also glow
in the dark all right that's enough
I'm doing a lot here people attempt to
make the entire thing glow in the dark
it's now green okay so we are done
putting all of our highlighter scrapings
into the little pan I just counted and
it looks like we've got 45 different
highlighter colors in there that means I
also have 45 different colors on my face
right now I think we should collect all
of the fallen shavings and put that in
as well and then next I'm gonna use one
of these little sticks to mix our
mixture all together I may also have to
do a little bit of grinding as well
because some of the chunks are kind of
big okay so I think now that we've mixed
it up we're ready for the moon mousse
which if I remember the process
correctly you basically pat down the
mixture with the spatula and then squirt
the mousse onto it oh I forgot that this
thing just disappears like magic all
right now I'm gonna let that absorb in
and then pack it down again did I put
too much on I'm really curious to know
as to why that one spot is just like
poking out
oh my god it's opening up oh is a bubble
Wow alright it looks like things have
calmed down so I think I'm ready to
press this down one more time before we
go to bed
I think that if I just leave it open
overnight it'll hopefully evaporate out
anyway if the liquid still there it's a
liquid highlighter and besides the
mousse it looks really fun and shiny in
there so I'm pretty excited to get this
thing on my face and get the rest of
these off my face alright so we're going
to whip out our only daily facials
five-in-one water activated
like lots instead of just being a makeup
remover they're supposed to remove your
makeup but also cleanse tone exfoliate
and hydrate got a lot of stuff going on
there all right so I'm going to put it
under water and then you kind of rub it
to create a lather and then this is what
I do so we can get ourselves the
California Pizza Kitchen for dinner oh
wow look at that
oh nothing more satisfying than like a
fully used makeup wipe these things
definitely do a pretty thorough job of
taking your makeup off I'm someone who
like oftentimes uses an oil-based
cleanser to remove my makeup and then a
water-based cleanser to like take the
oil off and something that's cool about
these is that they kind of take care of
both oil and water-based cleansing in
one all right and then when you're done
taking off all your makeups you rinse
the cloth again to kind of like finish
off the job well I forgot to go into my
lips I forgot that I put highlighter
there too all right so I am all washed
cleansed toned refreshed and ready to go
so we're gonna wrap up for the evening
and tomorrow morning we'll check back in
with our Franken highlighter and see how
it's doing all right so it's the next
morning I've come to inspect our Frank
and highlighter and it seems to be
looking okay so laughs I'm gonna press
this thing down and then we're gonna do
our makeup and put this bad boy on the
face so I'm showered now and ready to do
my makeup just looking at it in the pan
right now I think it's dried down to be
like pretty rose Goldy but let's watch
it on my hand and see how it looks
before we get into the face oh wow
holy crap that is actually very
pigmented it is super pink though it's
definitely more rows than gold in my
opinion it feels really soft and nice
though the texture is very nice so since
we're nearing a full face of Frank and
makeup products I'm gonna also wear my
other Franken makeups today and you know
just have the whole family together so
I'm gonna do my makeup right now and
make sure to use the Franken foundation
the Franken shadow and the Franken nude
lipstick so I think that with all the
other Franken products on my face we're
ready to go in with our rosy highlighter
all right here we go the cheekbone I
mean that's there already let's do the
other side here this sides slightly more
wet
lit I don't know if I'd call this
blinding yet let me apply a little bit
more let me put a little bit under my
brow bone Cupid's bow and then tip of
the nose right I don't know I said a lot
of fun
all right you can definitely see it on
the nose Wow hello all right so it's on
it's not necessarily blinding in this
light but I'll show you guys how it
looks under my like LED panels next door
and then also outside in the sunlight
all right so here I am in artificial
light and you can definitely see it in
here it's saying hello oh is what it
says yeah I definitely put so much of
this stuff on that it looks kind of like
me on a normal day after like 10 hours
of being outside so that's a lot of oil
that I would have produced 10 hours
outside with my glands
we're megawatt all right so we're out in
full Sun now oh it's a little shimmery
ty what do you think of it I could see
your face looks a little globish orbital
celestial is that was supposed to look
like the less jewel is better than
globish globish like it's kind of like
like the beginning of planet Earth when
it comes around it's like that big
bright light ah so it looks like the Sun
it looks at the Sun that's good that's
what I meant
alright so we're here at the mall and
we're gonna be looking for a doop
Franken highlighter I think I'm just
gonna swatch them on my hand and try and
find a dupe I guess we could swatch on
the face but my face is tired of being
swatch to pollen alright so I've got two
fistfuls worth of swatches of possible
dupes for the Franken highlighter at
first I was trying to swatch a lot of
them that were sort of like pinky
looking but a lot of those ones that
look pink in the pan end up kind of like
bold
peachie on the skin but these on my
right hand are the better swatches this
one is the pink shade from the Sephora
luminizing palette and this one is the
hourglass ambient lighting powder in
mood light all right now let's confirm
if anything the Franken highlighter is
just like a more shimmery version of
these guys maybe that little bit of
extra shine is the glow in the dark
speaking of that how should we see if
this thing is cool in the dark just go
somewhere dark and see what happens is
that how the other one works I think so
okay so it turns out the way you test
this glow in the dark highlighter is the
black light so um we got one just so you
guys know this is what the glow of the
dark highlighter looks like next to a
black light nice well that's crazy
okay and then this is our highlighter
with the black line on it look at my
mustache right now is it cool in the
dark oh there is a little bit of it yeah
Cupid's bow do you have any under your
eyebrow oh yeah did she's not so much I
guess I think it's hard to see it cuz
it's more spread out
I think the Cupid's bow slash mustache
area was somehow allocated a lot of the
glow-in-the-dark pigments I don't know
what all the other respects are around
my face there's like blue specks - what
is that it's questionable alright so
that was my day wearing my Franken
highlighter when I first put it on my
face in the sort of like shady natural
light of the other rooms it didn't look
like super super shiny but once we got
under the artificial lights and then out
of the Sun and also when comparing it to
other highlighters in Sephora I was
pretty impressed by how it looked one of
the interesting things to me about it is
that there were so many interesting
colored highlighters that went into this
Franken highlighter and on my face it
looks pretty normal that said I was
surprised that I could see some of the
glow-in-the-dark pigments on my face I
did have a little bit of a heavy hand in
there you know just trying to get some
in there but um I don't know my
moustache was a glowing and that is my
desired look so all in all I would say
this is a good addition to the Franken
family they all seem to be living in
harmony together on my face right now I
actually think they sort of suit each
other all the siblings getting along so
