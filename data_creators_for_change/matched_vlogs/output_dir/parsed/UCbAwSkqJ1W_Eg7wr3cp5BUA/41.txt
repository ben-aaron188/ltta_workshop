hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm gonna be trying out a
full face of 7-eleven makeup that's
right 7-eleven has evolved they are now
competitors with Sephora just in case
you guys don't know 7-eleven is a
24-hour convenience store that I and
many others frequent for chips now when
you think about it I guess it makes
sense that 7-eleven might want to sell
makeup I mean they sell a lot of things
beyond snacks like airhead flavored
slushies chicken wings and bugles they
also sell toiletries like razors and
toothpaste so if I saw them start to
sell typical drugstore makeup brands I
guess I wouldn't really be that
surprised
but this is their own makeup line which
did surprise me their line is called
simply me beauty which they launched
about a week ago and everything is
supposed to cost between three and five
dollars so think in the couple of big
gulps throw in a bag of Funyuns range so
let's head out to our local 7-eleven
pick up some makeup and see how it is
because I like makeup and I also like
snacks nothing like a good morning run
to 7-eleven I would like a taquito for
breakfast I do have had it to feed over
breakfast
it's not bad okay so we're at 7-eleven
now we're gonna head in and pick up a
full face of beauty products they have
37 things I don't think I'm gonna get
all 37 but I'm going to get one of each
category to create a 7-eleven look so
that I see the beauty creams and some
concealers they only have a couple of
color so I'm going to be
and then right next to it our eyeliner
in the mascara so let's go for these two
Oh No
torn stuff I'm gonna get a
bronzor and also
then that's definitely denied
an eye shadow then Oh down here tools
and lip stuff
flashes
yeah okay so we got kicked out for
filming but I think I got my full face
of products um I spent fifty dollars at
ninety cents I didn't want to get some
snacks though so we're gonna go to a
different 7-eleven that's just down the
road and get some taquitos etc so
something I noticed that they didn't
have at the last door was some type of
like setting powder or powder so as
we're going to the next 7-eleven I'm
just gonna see if they also have a
display and just like poke around a
little bit but we're mostly going for
snacks so we tried to be a little more
incognito this time basically I got some
spicy snacks for later to really you
know give the makeup a run for its money
we've got some taquitos for now
Tyler's about to dig in god bless and
then we've also got this down here it's
not just a super gulp or a big gulp it's
a double gulp I've literally just bought
more Diet Pepsi than anyone should ever
drink you might turn into aspartate if
you drink this whole thing I did
actually find some translucent setting
powder in there it was down by the tools
so I think I've actually got everything
now you're kicked out of the last one
but that won't stop us from getting the
setting powder I think of us getting
kicked out is all the evidence you need
that this video was definitely not
sponsored despite the super gulp next to
me alright so we're back with my
7-eleven haul this double gulp is really
sweating right now it's really just it's
it's all over the table for scale my
head alright so let's dive into the
makeup I'm gonna try it on all now and
then wear it for the rest of the day and
see how it lasts how it is what happens
so let's start with the eyebrow stuff
usually I start with my eyebrows so I've
got this dark brow powder and wax I
usually use an eyebrow pencil so I don't
usually use this method but I think I do
the wax first I don't know if that did
much besides maybe cement them down
alright so here's a little bit of this
darker powder
oh oh that's dark I'm making quite a
bold brow so that's the choice for the
day this is a matriarch of a caterpillar
family to the monarch literally we just
spool it out a little bit just kind of
smooth things over
the weird thing is they're kind of
feathery so they don't really look like
they've been drawn on with a sharpie
they're just very wide so let's move on
to the eye shadow I'm gonna grab an
eyeshadow primer and slap it on real
quick and then we'll keep going
alright so my eye shadow is this
aubergine
matte and shimmer eyeshadow collection
looks edible it does not smell edible
what is an aubergine it's like an
eggplant I feel like it must be like a
zucchini I look it up it's an eggplant
it is an expansion of the word for
eggplant
I've watched veggie tales I know my
vegetables all right so I'm just gonna
grab some of these colors and put them
on I mean this is just the base shade
but it seems to be on and doing what
it's supposed to be doing and then I'm
just gonna go into a couple of these
deeper shades I would call that more of
a pumpkin
than an eggplant but maybe that's just
me oh this shade at the very bottom is
more of the eggplant shade this like
more reddish purple in the middle is
quite brown orange II though it's a
little bit of like a pumpkin spice
surprise so next is concealer and
foundation they only had three colors
for each product so hopefully this works
all right so I'm just gonna squeeze a
bit out on here I don't want to just use
my fingers because of all of the
taquitos so let's go with the beauty
blender and you know what taquitos in
your face
I mean I want to Kito's in my face but
not necessarily on my face oh yeah I
think that looks like a color that's
gonna work this is the lightest one they
have though so if you were like super
pale it probably wouldn't work for you
it smells like sunscreen kind of reminds
me of the summer of the summertime I
think that it feels pretty nice on the
face it's just it's looking a little
shiny I do look a little bit like an
Academy Award you know some type of
golden mane
I do have translucent powder though so
hopefully that will help all right so
next is the concealer also in the color
light I'm feeling pretty good about this
color match so hopefully this will be
the same color it's nice and like a
little bit on the watery side it looks
like it's not gonna be like super full
coverage but it does not feel oily
you'll just do a couple of strokes to
cover up my mustache just for good
measure I kind of like this concealer it
does seem to blend in very well although
I would have liked like a little bit
more coverage for my under eye bags
suitcases totes
Vinnie packs my under eye fanny packs
usually right now I use the loose
setting powder to like bake everything
down I don't have any loose setting
powder because they didn't have any at
7-eleven but they did have this
translucent all shades matte powder oh
oh and they've given me a little sponge
and little mirror alright so I'm just
gonna use this big brush and just try
and set
everything down oh it's it's flying up
I'm dreaming of a translucent Christ mom
I mean it does seem to be mattifying how
much it's mattifying it's unclear this
is like the first thing that worries me
a little bit just because I do create
oil I'm an oil producer if you will so
I'm just trying to put as much setting
powder as possible to start out with
alright so now that I used the setting
powder maybe we should go in with the
eyeliner so this is the liquid felt tip
eyeliner in black so it definitely looks
like a felt tip marker that's definitely
the vibe I'm getting there's a little
wing there's a little wing template so
I'm gonna drag the eyeliner across and
try and finish it off this is pretty
matte it's a little bit inflexible like
it is like a marker it's not like a
brush at the end at all but it does seem
to be doing the job as long as it
doesn't run out of ink
I think this is pretty legit alright so
next I'm gonna do all my cheek stuff so
I've got a bronzer for contouring a
blush and a highlighter this is the
matte and shimmer bronzer in Sun glow
I'm just gonna grab like a little
contouring brush put a little bit of
that matte bronzer on there and do the
thing that looks pretty good actually
I'll put a little bit under the double
chin maybe it's a little bit on the warm
side but I actually like it alright so
next is the color blush in the color
coral quite an orange shade huh oh there
it is at first I couldn't see it funnily
enough the orange kind of complements
the like pumpkiny color on my eyes I
didn't really go in for the darker color
it's a little bit intimidating to me so
let me just do a little bit of
translucent powder just to blend it in
slightly and then we'll highlight so
this highlighter is called the radiant
highlighter it's kind of like a
yellowish color and like a more orange
rose Goldy color clear it is I can see
it in person can you see on camera yeah
a little bit it's a pretty subtle
highlight I think in general the cheek
products blended in pretty well though
so I'm pretty pleased with them overall
they like rose orange gold highlighter
doesn't help the oscar effect but maybe
that's just what we're going with so we
just have lashes mascara and lipstick
left I thought I would just stop for a
little taquito break is it good it's
pretty cold but it's so good all right
so these are my fake lashes and
I pulled out my lash glue right here but
they actually give you a little bit of
lash glue and like a little bit of a
container up here so they're just like
7-elevens got your back so there's not
that much lash glue in this thing so
because I'm gonna have to do a couple of
attempts I'm gonna use my lash glue just
cuz I'm gonna run out of theirs
nope well good to see you too
let's just put a little bit on here I
actually think these lashes look pretty
nice and natural the biggest issue is
going to be my ability to put them on
well alright so after my fake lashes I'm
gonna use this volume and length mascara
in black oh wow so it's like a rubber
brush which is cool and they've got a
nice spiky ball at the bottom for your
bottom lashes if you look at the formula
it looks to be like very elastic almost
does it look like melted cheese a little
bit
reminds me of the taquito I just ate I
miss it already alright so these are my
fake lashes with mascara on them I think
they look pretty voluminous from far
away it kind of gives like a soft look
but I think that from close-up you can
really see like the amount of lash I've
got going on there's kind of little
while spider eyes alright so last but
not least is the lip color this is the
lip crayon in the color blush oh wow
this is more orange than I expected
that's a cheeto I don't dislike it with
the rest of the look but it's definitely
now like I look like I look like a cup
of butternut squash soup I guess because
it's called blush I expected it to be
more of like a peachy nude but this is a
hundred percent mac and cheese besides
that it smells and tastes like a Crayola
crayon so it's got some good nostalgia
vibes to it but with this lip color this
is my entire 7/11 makeup look overall
everything was definitely usable some
things were a little bit better than
others but there was nothing that just
straight-up didn't work I'm gonna wear
it for the rest of the day and see how
it lasts alright let's go
I'm taking my big gulp out on the town
but
you know just want to show you guys the
first sip and see how much the big gulp
straw would take away from my lipstick
definitely a mark on there this lipstick
isn't like a liquid lipstick or a matte
lipstick so I don't expect it to be
super transfer proof but I did get a
good nice skid on there I've made an
alarming amount of progress on this
video you're very drinking like two cans
of coke so it's been like an hour I did
my makeup look pretty good
it looks great it's not too warm out
it's actually kind of cool out so I
think that the oil is being suppressed I
think I should probably stop it's just
too much aspartame I think the lipstick
is definitely fading a little bit but
it's actually looking less orange in
this light and also with some fading
it's looking more like the color that I
thought it would be so I'm very pleased
actually we're gonna take this away from
you're drinking too much of this stuff
it's like very warm it's really flat
from the bubbles Nick alright so it's
been about five hours and this is where
I'm at with the double gulp but I think
that the lipstick has pretty much faded
off at this point but I will say that
like four to five hours for like a non
liquid lipstick it's pretty good I
didn't love this color but there were a
couple of other colors of this product
which I may indulge in show next I've
got these flamin hot items I have
actually gathered a decent of shine and
oil as it is I'm sure you guys can see
so I'm gonna reap outter up just a
little bit just to give it a fighting
chance and then we'll see how the makeup
stands up to some spices snacks Hot
Cheetos and takis like Mordor you taste
so good I love this video I'm just a
loud D junk food it's been a really
healthy day I would say don't try this
at home kids
alright I'm gonna keep eating these and
then we'll check back in once I got
there some some moisture alright I'm I'm
done I didn't finish the bag but I think
I think I have to be done I'm craving
broccoli now okay so this is my face
after all of the flamin hot snacks
unintentionally actually what's going on
is that my nose is running and my eyes
are like slightly watery but besides
that I don't think the flaming hots
really did much besides the taste
amazing I think that just wearing the
makeup around for a few hours did a lot
more so for my final little segment
tonight
I'm gonna be using the 7-eleven makeup
remover wipes because some wipes are
good at removing the eye makeup and some
not so much and also we've got another
taquito the Monterey Jack ones are
definitely the best they were out of
them so we have to get the Triple A
which aren't bad but not quite the same
all right so I'm gonna try and like take
off like half my makeup so you can see
how it does
these are taking off everything except
for the eyeliner and the fake lash
pretty well it does feel like I have to
kind of pull on stuff a little bit but
when I look at the face it actually
looks like really clean oh yeah there we
go
goodbye I wouldn't say I would replace
my current makeup wipes with these ones
but they get the job done in a pinch
same with the chipotle chicken taquitos
they're not the Monterey Jack ones but
in a pinch so that was my day wearing
7/11 makeup I probably look really crazy
right now so maybe I'll try and like
talk from one side or the other so I've
divided the products into things that I
like and probably would use again and
things that I probably wouldn't use
again so over here I've got the
translucent setting powder the eyebrow
gel the concealer and the BB cream and
on this side I've got the eye shadow the
blush bronzer and highlighter the
lipstick mascara eyeliner which fell
over and the makeup wipes the only thing
not pictured is the fake lashes which I
don't usually wear but the fake lashes
that I had were just as good as any
other I've tried I would say that my
least favorite product was probably the
setting powder unfortunately I just
don't think it could really stand up to
the oil glands on my face my favorite
product out of all of them though was
this eyeliner marker I thought it did a
good job I thought it was easy to draw
with and went on very matte but still
pretty comfortable and as long as this
thing doesn't dry out I think this is a
winner so overall I would say I had a
mixed but pretty positive experience
with this 7/11 makeup my insides had a
similarly mixed but less positive
experience today with the double gulp
taquitos and flamin hot snacks that I
ate today but you know it was for
