hello friends and welcome to another
video it's that time again time for
another period video and this month I'll
be taking on another strange period
product period yoga pants so I've tried
period leggings in the past and I
thought they were gonna be a huge
game-changer it sounded like you got
your period you put on your leggings
you're done but the company that
produced them had a bunch of caveats
notably that you weren't really supposed
to wear them without a pad and also that
they were meant to secure a pad inside
of leggings like that was also their
main function it was a little unclear
not to mention the fact that it also had
quite a visible moose knuckle situation
in the crotch region so needless to say
I was a little disappointed in the
previous experience but recently I found
these period yoga pants by dear Kate
which seemed to fulfill some of my
expectations of the previous product
they say they can hold one teaspoon of
liquid by themselves which doesn't sound
like a lot but we're gonna push them to
the limit and see exactly how much that
is okay let's bring them out I saw that
one sailing towards my head too I was
just like yes okay here they are so
these are called the go commando capri
pants I've got one in this grey mosaic
color and one in this galaxy color they
are a hundred dollars each so they're
pretty really pricey but I have seen
some normal yoga pants in a similar
price range and if they do their job
handling the Crimson Tide they could be
worth it overtime over a lot of time but
over time so first impressions of these
pants is that they're more of like
swimsuit material type yoga pants I
would say I definitely prefer the softer
type of workout pants but whatever they
need to do to really get the job done I
understand so it does look like this
crotch is less of a square shape which
is already a good thing it looks like
I've got more of like a triangle in the
front and a pad shape in the back I feel
like this is gonna be probably the most
visible part but the front looks pretty
smooth I mean I'm gonna guess that this
is the pad part
that catches the blood it is a little
bit of a teardrop shape so you're gonna
want to make sure you're like going
right here or here and you're not going
like right up here I feel like you're
just gonna have to try and aim all right
let's try them on mmm I do like this
pattern I did get a couple of pattern
ones just to sort of live on the edge I
will say that right off the bat this
crotch is smooth but there is no camel
toe moose knuckle like it's it's looking
pretty good right there is a little bit
of a pad in the back just a little bit
of a diaper back there but you have to
look really carefully yeah I think the
pattern actually helps almost avert the
gaze yeah like oh there's a lot of
shapes happening I think they seemed
pretty good I think I got some good
range of motion I can definitely feel
the gusset like moving around a little
bit when I do stuff like this okay but
I'm just kind of like bobbing and we're
just kinda like bobbing around okay
seems like it's in the right spot you're
gonna get dizzy you know that why did I
do that so last time when I tried out
the period leggings I wore them all week
but since these are like specifically
designed to be active wear or like
workout gear I'm gonna take these guys
on three different workouts on three
different days of my period staying one
out of seven so we'll spend the next
three days working out yeah this is
gonna work out you know you're just
standing back we'll see what happens so
for my first workout he took these bad
boys hiking I wear the galaxy leggings
they were like we'll just put strategic
red splotches just in case anything
happens it could just be a nebula
exactly
it's a galaxy this was on day two of my
period and the floodgates tend to be
pretty open that day I know the only
thing you really have to be worried
about is like the range of movement
like as I wha does the positioning of
the built-in pad change so that is will
no longer be able to catch what its
father but hiking is not a super frantic
workout you're kind of just like walking
vertically up the mountain like kind of
moving your legs next to each other see
once you start working out it's hard to
tell what's wet and what's not sweat so
I think I'm doing okay
but there are some questionable yes I
did feel like a couple of drops during
the hike we've made landfall who better
keep moving Mount Lions out here we
hiked a little bit later in the day
today than usual so there's more people
around to witness me but I actually
think that to the naked eye from far
away
I'm doing fine like nothing weird is
happening and I will say that I don't
think anything super tragic happened in
the pants we'll see when we got off the
mountain what the damage is but
hopefully I won't leave until then yeah
there's other bears out here so don't
worry about it you were nervous there
was a mountain lion fall I did that
afterwards when we got home I checked
out the situation I think that I'm all
clear I don't think there was any
leaking which is good obviously I
definitely do feel a little bit damp but
I feel like you know I was kind of
wearing these for a couple of hours and
so like for those two hours even on day
two it seems like they held up pretty
well and so after that I was feeling
pretty confident okay so I'm post shower
ready to tackle the day I'm gonna wear
my other pair of yoga pants for the rest
of the day and wash them both tonight
and hope that they're pretty quick
drying so I can wear them tomorrow to
yoga and I thought things were going
great but that is when I hit my first
roadblock okay so an interesting
development has developed I just sat
down in this chair to film a
pre-interview for something and I felt
myself flowing but not anymore than I
was this morning so I thought that
everything would be fine but then when I
stood up and went to the bathroom I
noticed I had actually started leaking
out of the sides of the little gusset
area like completely through on this
side completely through on this side and
completely through on the gusset part
unfortunately the other pair is the one
that you can really like camouflage any
type of stains and with these gray ones
it's kind of out in the open
as I said before deer Kate mentions on
their website that the leggings should
be able to hold about
one teaspoon of liquid in the gusset
part now I've crunched the numbers and
on average people lose between 35 and 50
milliliters of blood over the course of
their cycle which translates to seven to
ten teaspoons over the entire cycle so
roughly speaking these leggings should
be able to handle about a half a day or
1/3 of a day for me as someone who has a
6 or 7 day cycle but I was only filming
for about two hours so I think another
part of the problem is that when I was
sitting down the gusset shifted so it
was no longer where it needed to be to
really provide that coverage I feel like
maybe it's meant for motion and not for
sittings so with that bogey on day one I
was a little weary going forward okay so
what is the next morning and my leggings
are mostly dry so I'm just gonna wear
them and just hope for the best
so for my second workout we went to yoga
ok ready to head in
wish me luck it's a steamy place man day
3 in general is a little less crazy flow
wise for me but you know it's still
pretty generous but in yoga you are also
doing a lot of different positions
you're sideways you're upside down I
mean I'm not that good of being upside
down but people are upside down so the
movement to gusset ratio is quite high
ok so we just got out of yoga if I
thought that yesterday I couldn't tell
what was going on because it was just
kind of like a soup I was wrong that's
today I don't think anyone knew I was
wearing period yoga pants no but
the yoga was hot and the but each his a
sweaty but when I went home and checked
out the situation I did appear to have a
little bit of leakage on either side of
the gusset not a lot of leakage not
nearly as much as yesterday when I was
just sitting down but kind of just like
a little bit on either side kind of
feathered in a way I had only been
wearing them for like two hours tops
but I think part of the problem was that
I was just in so many different
positions that the gusset was just
moving all around so even though I'm
like really liking the way it looks it
seems like it might be a little bit not
as protective so my final workout was on
day four of my period it is like late
afternoon early evening and I'm heading
to the gym to get in a different type of
workout I would definitely say that
today is a little bit calmer downstairs
in the last two days it's less of a red
wedding and more of just like a little
birthday party or something so let's go
to the gym hop on the elliptical for
like I don't know like 30 ish minutes
and then do some other stuff and see how
it goes I wore the grey mosaic leggings
again just to walk a little bit on the
wild side I don't really want to like
sit on any machines like I don't want to
like
yeah you want to play it safe look I
want to get him the elliptical I'm just
you twelve bounce up and down this
though to play it safe a little bit I
went into a less populated corner of the
gym on a machine that seemingly no one
really wanted so this seems to be some
sort of hybrid between a Stairmaster and
elliptical which is
you're exciting
cause when she wants I'm not really
a little bit
right
definitely sweaty not sure how much we
should zoom in on the crotch no sloshing
no like sludge devil it's a moisture I'm
hoping that it's really sweat and after
the workout I went home and checked
everything out and it seemed like we
were mostly in the clear
I noticed maybe like a little bit of
feathering I would say outside the edges
of the designated pad area but actually
for the first time nothing has really
come through to the other side so I
called this experience on day four on
the elliptical a success finally leaked
free so overall I had a pretty mixed
experience with these yoga pants it is
really smooth and discreet from the
front but that kind of leaves the gusset
with a smaller surface area in general
it seems kind of like with these period
leggings either you have a good-looking
crotch or you got coverage so I feel
like we just need some like NASA level
in here just to fix this situation
because I want both given this swimsuit
like material it also increases the
swamp factor which leaves you in the
middle of the workout kind of wondering
whether something is sweat or something
more so it's not really saving you on
stress if you wanted to get these you
could probably use them on the lighter
days of your period without any issue
but if you're trying to substitute these
in as athleisure on a heavier day I
would say you should definitely wear
some backup or just not do it they are
pretty easy to clean and I also didn't
notice any odor which is a big plus I do
however smell because I'm working out so
I wonder if that's like camouflaging the
period smell or maybe it's just that I'm
not really wearing the leggings for long
enough each day that I'm able to like
gather a scent overall I think I'm gonna
keep using these just because I have
them and they were expensive and I do
think that there are some possible use
cases but the search still continues for
that all in one period pant its my white
whale
or should I say red whale thank you guys
