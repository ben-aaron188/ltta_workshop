Tyler's making fun of my dress but
Tyler's been wearing the same shirt for
three weeks
hello friends and welcome to another
video this week I'm going to be dressing
in outfits completely from the website
wish so wish is a website and app that
I've often seen on my Facebook feed that
features incredibly discounted items
including a lot of clothing now I
personally have been a little bit
hesitant to order clothes from this site
just figure this seems like it's a
little too good to be true like the
things I would get might not be what I
saw in the pictures but I got a lot of
requests from you guys and I'm also
incredibly curious myself so I decided
to order an entire week's worth of
outfits from wish and see how they are
not necessarily shoes and accessories
but all the body clothing I want to see
if I can find seven outfits so let's do
it
okay so I'm opening up the wish site
right now so right away I'm seeing like
a decent amount of clothes shoes a few
fidget spinners it looks like a
glow-in-the-dark shower head it seems to
me like the clothes on which range from
about one to ten dollars
I'm not going to limit myself to just
like the five dollar stuff but I have a
feeling that most of these things are
going to be around five dollars so I'm
sorry for the slight click but you guys
okay I feel like I have to start
somewhere I like these pants these are
like jogger sweatpants with some wrist
in them something I do appreciate is
that they have like ratings and reviews
like right on the product some people
are like one-star all the way but a lot
of other people are like four or five
stars oh here's a sizing chart I'm going
to get a large I'm going to get them in
black that's one pair of pants down so I
need to talk I do like this lace shirt
this is the duffel new woman
plus-size lace long-sleeve sexy
see-through blouse top people like that
four stars and it has 4000 reviews
people say to order a size up but
generally people are into it I'm going
to go with the large I don't have a big
boost anyway and go with the black I
promise not everything I buy will be
black but that top looks so cute black I
had to all right so that's outfit
this is interesting this is a summer
autumn women casual long-sleeve chiffon
dresses ladies fashion v-neck t-shirt
loose short dress tops they're just
trying to fit like every keyword in that
title this is a regional interview that
it has three and a half stars
there's no sizing chart and not a lot
about the sizes in the reviews so I'm
going to size up and get an 8
just because out rather that it's bigger
than smaller how about these gray that
sounds exciting
all right I'm going to add that to my
order about the two a chick boom this is
interesting okay this looks like a
hoodie dress I actually at one point in
my life was searching for a hoodie dress
and I saw images of this thing on Amazon
but I was too nervous to buy it I was
nervous that it wouldn't look like the
picture because it was so cheap let's
take a look she looks very hip and cool
interesting okay this also a three and a
half stars and it has five thousand
reviews a lot of the people who are
upset say it's too small so I'm just
going to just order up
I love this one she just says rack it
seems like all the other colors pretty
much are sold out except for black so I
think that I might get to buy black Jake
okay so that is three outfits down all
right let's take a look at this this is
a new summer women fashion solid off
shoulder t-shirt casual short sleeve
blouse loose tea tops black white this
is a two and a half star rating it looks
nothing like the picture it's just a
white Hanes t-shirt
nice shirt but it isn't an
off-the-shoulder sort more with a plain
t-shirt type shirt I think we have to
see what this is it seems like
everyone's saying that if you want it to
be off the shoulder you need it to be
really big so I'm going to get the extra
large like everyone was like this is
just a white t-shirt do not die and I'm
like yes bye so this is going to be off
the shoulder it would be cool to put
something underneath oh this is what I
want this is like one of those really
cute like cross like bralette top for $1
this is four stars of 3000 reviews and
it's like just right like no one said
that it was too small or too large oh
it's one size that's why that makes
sense alright let's add that in so we
just need a bottom for this outfit ooh
let's get a pair of jeans it should be
interesting
well also three-and-a-half stars with a
thousand reviews I'm going to go with
large the jeans are $11 so on the more
expensive side of the things that we've
got already
oh it's $14 okay never mind they were
$11 to begin and now they're suddenly
$14 so I guess that's fine outfit for a
chick it is cool to see like who's
buying what I guess the strategy would
probably to go for the things that more
people bought ooh look at this jumpsuit
I've seen one exactly like this at Urban
Outfitters I almost bought it I think
like a year ago I would buy this for $6
for sure made out of balloon material
material is like a swimsuit what on
earth is this thing I'm gonna get a
large and I'm going to get it in army
green
how about so that is outfit 5 I could
search something I have just been
scrolling maybe we could try something
like a skater skirt and see what happens
yeah here we go and look at this it's
one of those skater skirt that has a
little suspenders people like that it's
got four stars but only 20 reviews not a
lot of people are saying too small a lot
of people are saying too large I'm going
to buy a medium but it is kind of the
nerve wracking decision I think that
they had the right idea to just style it
look like a white t-shirt I love this I
ordered a black extra-large but I got a
white medium tank top that has words on
it them says I got a 4x and it appears
to be a toddler medium if you aren't
sure about what size you want go one
size up I feel like let's just go with
that so I'm going to get a large in it
okay and that is outfit six
oh this top is really cute and it's
almost gone I need it like a little
cleavage top I have none of that
it's called summer fashion women casual
sexy mesh v-neck blouse sleeveless tops
t-shirt vest around a lot of people
think it fits just right I'm just going
to get a medium this time around and see
what happens what's the difference
between black and cool black should I
get a cool black just to see what that
means all right so let's look for a
bottom for this outfit there is a tab it
says bottom blue those jeans are
questionable here's something so four
stars one written review it's not a lot
of information so this is probably the
riskiest purchase yet I'm going to get
it in
a large and that rounds out the last
outfit all right I think that it's seven
outfit a lot of the like estimated
arrival times are like well over a month
away it's going to take me a while to
get these things but I'm incredibly
excited to see what they are some of the
reviews were all over the place and it
also seems like sometimes people don't
get exactly the item they ordered like
not just it didn't look like a picture
like this is a completely different item
so we'll see but if any of these things
are good they were a great deal so let's
see what happens that is a lot of
five-dollar clothing so it's been about
a month and a half and these things have
been slowly trickling in but I think I
finally have everything mms so I took on
the pile hung everything up there were a
couple of things I felt like I didn't
recognize but we'll get to that when I
you know like try and put them on so I
started off with this green billowy
jumpsuit thing okay so here is the
jumpsuit on in the reviews people are
kind of weirded out by this thing they
said it was giant
and also maybe made out of balloon
material but when I got it it was pretty
cute and soft out of the bag I am kind
of loving this I think that there's a
couple of things they're a little odd I
thought her pockets at first but they're
just kind of like wings like there's
some wings around the thighs like MC
Hammer pants style and some strange
ruching around the cab but aside from
that it fits pretty well I put a belt on
it just to add some shape to it and I
also wore Birkenstocks to match the kind
of like earth's mama vibe because I was
getting from it I just look very
comfortable and I feel comfortable but I
also look comfortable
it was definitely hot outside but this
fabric was pretty thin and flowy a lot
of freeze weight
the air to comfort the fabric did cling
to my butt a little bit a couple of
crevices were spotted but besides that I
was pretty impressed by them when you
weigh the pros and cons like the price
versus the five families and evens out
45 - so outfit number two was this
sweatshirt dress that I was super
excited about I thought that this dress
looks like what was shown on the website
but it did fit a little awkwardly there
was some bulk like around the middle
because of the pocket and it was a
little bit shorter than I expected
especially in the size slit area okay so
we're at the mall right now I think the
style of the dress is fine I think like
besides the pockets like it's a cute
dress it's just so one not terrycloth
it's like a sea fleet so it could work
really well like with - boots in a
winter climate but in July in California
it's just like even inside the mall
do you think is my life dark summer
overall I wouldn't say I got scammed
with this dress like I did get what I
ordered but I didn't like it as much as
I hoped that I would it just didn't fit
me right it was a little too hot and
it's a bit of a tight hood you got a
little bit of the South Park effect
mm-hmm so outfit number three was my
white off the shoulder top black
bralette and distressed jeans okay so
here is an outfit on my body I like the
straps on the top of the bralette and I
actually can't fit into these jeans
pretty effectively the top was not just
a plain white Hanes t-shirt as the
reviews had suggested but it didn't show
off as much of the bralette as I wanted
it to it was also a little bit bulkier
than I expected there were a few more
holes than flops and I had hoped for
that said it was all pretty comfortable
to wear and I didn't really notice that
I was wearing wish clothing throughout
the day I'm liking it so far my only
complaint is that these pants are riding
down and I feel like if I tug on the
belt loops they're gonna just come on I
would maybe not wear all these things at
the same time again I feel like I looked
a little bit like a mid 2000s Jessica
Simpson it also looks at your hosting
TRL if this sleeve that bring out that
like late 2005 but the individual items
were pretty good day for brought us face
to face with the only item that I
actually did not recognize when it
arrived so I did not remember ordering a
pair of black pants but I did remember
ordering some distressed sweatpants I
think these are them
the way I identify that I haven't
actually received a completely wrong
item with the rips in the pant but this
definitely isn't what I thought that I
ordered they were supposed to be
sweatpants but they feel like all of the
x1 suit a little bit I was just so
surprised by the material of them these
things are like crepes
like an inedible very thin cloth pancake
they're neither sweatpants nor jeans
nor tears nor leggings they like state
clothing yeah that's what it's like it's
like dolphin the bat said the top was
super cute and it looks a lot like the
picture at first I put it on backwards
because there's no tag anywhere
let me just humor myself we just you
turn it around again but once I got it
on right wave front ways things started
going well okay to feel better so while
the pants were kind of a fail the top
was one of my favorite things that I got
I feel like they scammed me with the
pants and I scanned them for the top so
outfit five was my little suspenders
skater skirt and white crop top okay so
here is this outfit cuz skater skirt was
really a cute style but I just didn't
love the fabric so I had left the skater
skirt hanging for a while because when
it came out of the bag it was like super
wrinkly but the fold did not come out so
we drove down to Disneyland the car was
not super kind to my skirt why it's a
little more wrinkled than when you last
saw me which was already a little Rachel
to begin with I kind of wish it was more
of like a jersey type fabric and this is
more of just like a crinkly thumbs up
after walking around a little bit humid
I think my wrinkles are coming out maybe
not entirely but besides that I thought
that the skirt and the top will pretty
pieced together and I would say that the
crop top was a pretty solid buy I am
glad that I listened to review then
sized up though a prop I feel like both
items pretty much look like the photos
and with wish it can just be hard to
tell what the fabric is going to be like
before it gets to you so you kind of get
we can get monomers no so out of six six
was my mesh top and denim skirt now the
skirt was definitely my riskiest buy
because there was only one written out
review I would say that it spit like
widthwise
but it was a little bit longitudinally
challenged like my butt end here
from the front like it's not that short
it's just that the back gets shorter the
other thing is I feel like I'm kind of
like walking with my thighs close
together just to not move the shirt too
much so I think for something with no
reviews I didn't get an actual skirt and
not just like a puff of smoke and the
stolen credit cards so the top I liked
okay it definitely doesn't look like the
photo this is pretty close to what I
expected it's not perfectly fitted short
like there's some emptiness right here I
thought that it fit pretty well though
it does feel like swimsuit material it
feelingly would wish like even if it
looks like what I expected it to look
like there's always just like something
that's a little bit off I think most of
my focus was on the length of the skirt
it besides that the outfit was pretty
comfortable to wear around now outfit
seven was wrinkled pocalypse I'm sure
that you've seen this it would be less
wrinkly but I can't find my steamer but
I did leave this hanging for a week and
I also did the steamer shower trick and
pretty much none of the wrinkles had
come out by the time I put it on I just
look like I've been sleeping in this for
a few days maybe should I put a belt on
it without help I really do like how
it's longer in the back but I don't love
how it randomly cuffed my beads like
it's close to be kind of like a straight
down sheath dress and there was a little
like puppet I will say that there's
nothing wrong with the comfort of this
dress it feels just a little bit like
I'm wearing a sheet it was however a
pretty light and breezy dress for a hot
summer's day it's easy and breezy up in
my crotch easy
inappropriate and maybe if you were
living somewhere humid the wrinkles
would come out on their own so that with
my wish Hall it's definitely a crapshoot
and I don't know if I know how to
navigate wish any more now than I did
before I do think there's some stuff on
wish that is a very good deal the review
they're almost always all over the place
you have to go with your gut and then
actually really psyched about the stuff
that I found that I like because it's
kind of like finding the diamond in the
rough
so my favorites were the green jumpsuit
the black sheer lacy shirts the black
bralette and the white crop top but if I
had any advice for people shopping on
wish tops are more of a sure bet skirts
and dresses were a little shorter than I
expected and I think that sizing up
usually helped also if you see a pair of
cool distressed sweatpants do not buy
