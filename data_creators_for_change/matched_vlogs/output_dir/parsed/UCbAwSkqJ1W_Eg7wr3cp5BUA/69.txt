hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm here with the amazing
Wendy yes
wendy has an amazing channel she does a
lot of DIY life hack we just filmed a
what's in the box challenge it's links
below go check that out after this one
but first watch us try and DIY some
Instagram corset bra so you know I'm
sure that these corset bras have been on
Instagram like sponsored posts and just
on people's Instagram and Facebook feeds
for a while now I have one right here I
don't have a lot of cleavage I don't
know if you do I mean yeah it's it's
hard it's hard out here yeah we're
trying to squeeze it up and we're gonna
hold our elbows very close together as
with all internet specific products you
never know exactly what you're going to
get when you order it so I wanted to try
and DIY this to see if you could get the
same effect at home and then I thought
who better to help me out with this
project and wengie a DIY Queen so how
much is that when you bought it this was
about 20 bucks okay so how much it is
got out DIY and I'm going to be about
the same these bras are sold at a bunch
of different websites at a range of
prices and it's hard to tell which
version is the right version it seems
like everyone kind of uses like the same
picture I've seen some of these at a
jacked up price like more expensive like
up like 40 bucks so maybe if you fell
for a bad you know you could save money
by doing a DIY version instead great so
let's begin
all right we've got these uh plunge
push-up bras it's this backless
strapless plunge push-up bra from Target
and we both got the size a /b yes now
now you know how the more you know and
then we've got these grommets of various
sizes so I didn't know which size to get
now else I called eyelet and then we've
got some cordage well this is for
parachutes apparently oh I love a thingy
shoelaces and this is also good we also
we've got some extra fabric we've got
these patches you know just when you're
DIY you can add your own Flair yeah my
harem style is why I love DIY we do have
a hot glue gun
well for no reason I literally pulled
this out and write words are the only
ones you like we don't need that no I'm
just going to have it unless you're
planning to cause what are your jobs
well if all else fails we might we also
have this hammer and we also have like
four pockets of violence so the program
has confused which one else is with you
but I thought that you were the fashion
designer when she yeah there's one
that's flowers I'm going to use this one
so I guess we caught up with you on that
you know maybe you want to like mark out
where you want to put the eyelet say
like maybe they're even on the Animas
back a bit because you might need some
room for the eyelet well alright that's
what I did yeah looks like ol polar bear
or something doesn't he colonel yeah
yeah too bad we're just going to hammer
him thank you dance
ha ha don't you hear the hot glue gun
I'm really worried ok so now that we
have our cups marked out we got to poke
some holes for our eyelets here you go
don't hurt yourself alright so I'm just
going to stab ya davin twitch maybe oh
that one through pretty easily actually
yeah keep working it until you get the
right size : oh well you can actually
get the eyelet and see if it fits
through so while she's using the seam
ripper I'm going to go into scissors and
see if this is doing anything easier
there we go oh okay well you know I'm
having fun with spearing away over here
alright I think it's time to push the
baby through look a bit oh yeah you put
the bacon there we go don't work yeah
success you got it no that that it yeah
so once you have your eyelets in place
on top and on bottom you got to use this
little eyelet tool to hammer that shit
together
it's attached oh that's why we needed
Wendy here because otherwise I would
have don't even know what I would have
been doing all right so I am also going
to try and hammer my eyelet in how do
you know what it's done you just keep
going until you know it's done really
that's in there that's in there yeah
what I do
yeah that feels very satisfying but this
is awesome look at that you could just I
mean I know what just wear it as an
earring like me I'll I over all right
let's finish this up hello no we did one
out of six and you're like Ramon it's
just too bad but you need to have two
rooms you know to seat one a mono boo
hmm
or you know what best friend boo you can
tie you to ourselves together it's like
a potato sack race or like a
three-legged a stupid race itself I'm
just making a lot of noise good time
being really well the first completed
bra there are McDonald's near here you
just missed the air like you could smell
McDonald's from like miles away get it
ahh looks great yeah I'm really proud of
them it's not super symmetrical you can
see my little nose
yeah but a cute it's there I like those
really cool so now that we've got these
we just poured them together I think so
all right well the thing I worried about
the cord is is like there's nothing to
finish them so it could fray that might
need a like a lighter
we need them up I think it'll lighter
doesn't work but top and bah-wah
that's complicated there are no children
that live in this apartment but it's
childproof you can myself the way you
like the way that you're surely I need
to burn this immediately this is already
an issue yeah when do I stop just never
I think he stops okay
that's quite a nice I can hold the flame
open highest and could set stuff on fire
hold on well talk to Big Top couldn't
walk the walk there we go
oh that's all you do okay noted I may
have burned mine too much even is enough
eating carry oh yeah oh my god weird it
looks you guys I think this looks like
it might actually work
it looks pretty professional so we're
done with the body of our bra but we've
also got this stuff it please you're
interested I think I'm going to want a
hollow star mine I'm doing this turtle
am I not a turtle enough for the turtle
club yeah this is an iron on oh well
maybe we shouldn't iron them because of
the adhesive in the broad should we burn
it on Wow all right why not you Jake
yeah why not
you can melt this glue no I'm thinking
we do like a quick like a flame
underneath it you might melt the glue
just enough for us to stick it on almost
all that these these ones did no Lindsay
yeah okay so the star didn't work but
let me try my turtle he's amazing I've
injured my turtle
I think the patches were not meant to be
but just know that I would have put a
turtle on here so we are going to put
these on
got a couple white tank tops and we'll
just be you know before and after this
is wengie before Hey
and then this is me before I think what
you've got more questions all right
I am peeling this off all right
limp trunk LaRon oh my god it's kind of
working you don't have to play the
individual boob are we on each other
hello cleavage there we are I think
we've arrived in Cleveland Oh Stan and
sham are you doing
okay it's all I've got you think it's
working I think that we were medium
successful yeah I know it worked out
well I've got a little
something-something
yeah it's a little line basically what
I've done is I've brought in the like
armpit boob there's just a little valley
in here like because you kind of got
like this which is pulling it and then
this is being let loose this bonds
really wide for me no it's not really
pulling in as much as that line we
needed just a smaller cup it like a
narrow look yeah yeah oh yeah I think it
narrower Cup and while your chances
would work I can see how this is working
and I see how this would work I feel
like you know like a lot of the pushup
comes from the vertical push like this
does the horizontal push you're going to
get the line but I feel like sometimes
the line might look weird because you
don't have the vertical some so if
nothing else I learned a lot thank you
