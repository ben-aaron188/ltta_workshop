hello friends and welcome to another
video over the past couple of months
I've been hearing about this thing
called lip sense which is apparently
supposed to be a long wearing lip color
that lasts for 4 to 18 hours and it's
supposed to be like everything-proof
smudge proof waterproof kiss proof food
proof ninja proof if everything proof
now I'm not sure that I necessarily want
my lipstick to last for 18 hours 18
hours is just a long time I feel like
the time that you get 6 hours of sleep
but I don't expect to be wearing
lipstick for all of my waking hours but
I felt like I had to try it out myself
and see if the legends were true so
listen is sold by independent
distributors which means you can't just
like go to like lips cents calm and buy
lipstick from there you have to like
find a person who sells it to get it
from them so this is like the starter
pack for your lips cents journey you've
got like a lip color a lip gloss and
also a remover I've heard that you can
get lip scent off with other things but
you're kind of supposed to only be able
to get it off with verre remover from
what I've seen the prices areas a little
bit based on who your distributor is but
generally for this 3-pack it cost
between like 50 to 60 dollars I got this
color called raisin it's kind of like a
metallic dark red color I feel ready
just get into it I've just I've been
putting it off because I'm nervous to
see what will happen to my lips after
this like extremely heavy-duty lip color
shall we I just broke the feel whoo whoa
it smells exactly like hand sanitizer
I'm just going to shake it up really
quick it's all noise also in preparation
for this video I got my mustache waxed
yesterday but the esthetician went a
little crazy with the tweezers and
tweens my skin right here so I do have
like a little scab right there so I
apologize if you get to see that up
close because you definitely will but
you have a fair lip the directions on
the tubes they apply in one direction
beginning with the outside corner of the
mouth oh it hurts oh ah good uh-huh a
lot of it are a little bit
so it's gone oh wow there was like a
momentary just like tingle I could just
when you have like a little bit of an
open wound and you put like rubbing
alcohol on it just to cleanse it like it
stings for a second that's honestly how
it felt
oh it's horrible to know apply three
layers letting each dry three to five
seconds okay so I'm letting the first
coat dry just for a second
one thing that I am excited about is the
possibility of covering my butt hole lip
for good this could be the butthole
Slayer now for those of you not familiar
the butt hole lip is what I call the
inner waterline of your lips which
lipstick fades off of very quickly or at
least for me it does so maybe this 18
hour lipstick will finally cover my butt
hole I feel kind of a lot of pressure
because if I mess up then it's on my
face for 18 hours and I'm nervous
okay Lister kind of sticking together I
never skin looks people who I'm going to
stick my lips together forever but I do
like the color I like this raisin color
a lot Talia's brought up a great point
maybe this is for synchronized swimmers
yeah and like professional mermaid
alright third and final coat I'm going
to go the opposite way okay so that's
like the bottom the Kenichi the butthole
well no come on what's our stuff
together
okay on the top I feel like touch-up
work is like really high-risk you clean
your lipstick perfectly like three times
okay cool under mainland search to dry I
did three coats and then a little bit of
a touch-up right here because it got
kind of freaky on her why I don't think
I did a perfect job but I don't know
that I want to start over and they're
sitting like this I'm trying not to let
my lips crease up too much it's
definitely like less sticky as I'm
letting this dry see look at this now
I'm going to be putting on the
moisturizing blah that's alright like
vinegar but not the kind of vinegar you
cook with just it says this it'll
improve the longevity and I think also
hopefully improve the comfort that feels
a lot better before the gloss it felt
kind of like spin and sticky and kind of
like tapering like an extra layer of
skin but now with the gloss on it feels
like was lipstick and it definitely kind
of glistens to distract from any
imperfections in the lipstick kind of
reminds me of like Snow White poisoned
apples or perhaps like a raw steak I
also think like my butthole is pretty
covered and I hope it stays on there
because that would be a giant advantage
for lipstick for me okay so now that I
have it on I'm going to be wearing it
for the rest of the day and perhaps well
into tomorrow
going to be putting it through a series
of tests and then after 18 hours we'll
see if it's still on my lips I may
reapply the gloss just for comfort sake
but besides that this is the only
application of lipstick I'm going to
have so we'll see what happened okay so
it's been about five minutes and Tyler
has agreed after a lot of convincing to
kiss me they are sticky really yeah look
at anything on their eye all that gloss
don't I yeah no glossed out my color
looks pretty intact I mean it was a
little bit patchy to begin with but
mostly intact let's look at Tyler you
feel moisturized
I do feel moisturized okay so we are
about 45 minutes to an hour in we're at
the mall now we're going to get some
food court food for a little food test I
think in the light of day it looks like
a little less opaque but I think it
looks good so I'm going to say that
things are going well it's got video I
don't know how to bow down as I say so
I'll show you guys my looked right now
because my email
definitely morpholino de Olympics
if this was laughs I would be a happy
camper finish my longing my lipstick
look maybe it looks pretty good
I think what is happening and I think
the gloss is completely gone so you can
see the patchiness that existed before
and I will say the lunch is very tasty
and I feel like my lipstick didn't die
completely I just feel like my lips it a
little bit more clear than before lunch
but not necessarily was less lipstick on
them
he doesn't feel as nice about the career
walk on it so I'm going to put the gloss
on over it just for comfort
you're reapplying your layer defense
it's been about four hours since we put
see the lip depends on I'm out shopping
with Tyler we're getting tired from
shirt well Tyler makeover hello Tyler
makeover is helping a little bit around
even though when you look close up it
does a little more crack than it did to
begin with I think that from afar and
like the naked eye you can't really tell
I'm just worried just because I'm
noticing a little bit of wear and tear I
think Alex cute yeah the plain white
t-shirt so we are about six hours in and
I would say that but besides the fact
that my scab is really out about I'm
sorry about that guys I would say that
overall it hasn't really gotten much
worse than lunch I think lunch built the
lipstick a little bit of a blow but
since then it's kind of been like riding
pretty steady I will say that I think
that the butthole is a becoming a bit
uncovered let's take a look is that
lipstick that used to be there was a
little fight I had what six makes sense
that it would stick to the dry parts of
the lip longer than the wet parts of the
lips but we're going to get some boba
for the big straw to really challenge
that Lipson right where her so I got a
with spitting in it it looked weird case
quite good I think that the straw is
completely residue free and that's one
thing I'll say about look sense I
haven't seen this stuff anywhere else I
think it's just like kind of like slowly
fate and particle by particle pixel by
pixel okay so I finish my boba team here
is the final product the true
competition is can I say a wake long
enough to have this thing on my face for
18 hours and the answer is I might end
up sleeping in it okay guys so we're at
home now I feel like I put the lips ends
through a lot of different tests that
include like smudging and so I think
what's left is like the waterproof
aspect so we're going to go work out see
how this reacts to sweat and then
afterwards I'm going to take a shower
and see if this can last through the
shower and if it's still on my face then
I shall go to sleep in it so I am taking
off the rest of my face makeup outside
of my lip stuff you don't usually work
out with lipstick guns but like it feels
like something could get caught doing
you could get caught sweating in your
lipstick the gym is pretty empty hey
Tyler
I put just a little bit more gloss on
just to like give myself some comfort so
I was starting to sort of feel like the
paper enos of it against each other and
I think while I was doing that I may
have disturbed the here and there a few
- cracks for anyone wondering
Safiya tattoo it's fake
they all know it does it looks like feel
weird so far my mouth pretty open from
breathing so maybe it doesn't go back to
lipstick I don't think I was loving my
lips together very much so I don't know
that anything what happened I don't know
if there's enough sweat even though I
think I worked up a sweat
I don't there's enough to like actually
do anything it's it possible that it
looks better than when we started
so I wonder if the warmth of my skin has
melted it back into its form magic okay
guys so I would like to hop in the
shower really quick that is not coming
off oh don't fine it's not coming off
okay I'm going to love great health and
then all will Fiat what it's definitely
waterproof like it didn't smear in the
shower nor did it really come off in the
shower but the gloss is definitely a
hundred percent gone I'm gonna do that
besides like a piece right here and a
piece right here and in the general
water line it's generally still intact I
think that after lunch I was worried
that it was going to continue to
deteriorate but I think that it is going
to make it to our 18 even with my
imperfect applications so I'm going to
go to sleep for three hours and I'm
going to wake up and check back in and
see what the 18 hours look like okay I
may have overslept slightly so it might
be a little bit more than 18 hours it
feels look than I wanted my hand over
someone's like nothing is there but it's
still on which is kind of wild but I
have the oops remover and we're going to
finally take this thing off I hope that
it does come off I hope that it's not
just on here forever I'll hear you guys
cut off oh thank god I'm gonna wipe wipe
it okay it's not all coming off though
it's clinging on to the more dry skin I
mean definitely coming off
alright I'm free I feel a little bit
crazy I feel like my lips look a little
bit swollen almost had to do a detail on
to rub it around to get that off but
it's finally off well what a wild ride I
would kind of skeptical at first that
this lipstick would actually last for 18
hours but as my oversleeping shows us it
actually probably could last for longer
than 18 hours there definitely is some
wear and tear some fading a little bit
of crumbling some water line appearing
but it's definitely on your face for 18
hours No
question something that I wasn't
expecting was how difficult it would be
to apply and how like high stakes it
would be you got to be careful about
layering I think that you have to be
really careful that everything's dry
before you try and put a second coat on
if you make a small mistake you kind of
either have to like live with it for the
rest of the day or take it all off and
start again so it's just it's
interesting because I didn't feel like
this had the full full coverage of a
liquid lipstick that felt more like a
lip tint it is also pretty expensive
once you have like the starter kit you
can just buy like the lip colors like
individually so it's not sixty bucks
every time but in general it's a pretty
expensive lipstick I think on most
normal days I would probably go for my
usual lipsticks over lips then that said
I think it would be kind of cool to have
one of these bulletproof lipsticks like
in your lipstick arsenal like if you are
ever in a situation where you like had
to go somewhere and you couldn't bring
your lipstick with you or you had no
chance to reapply your lipstick this
could work really well maybe like
certain jobs or like a very extended
first date not even on a hike but just
like a long first date you know
helicopter ride I don't know like a very
very very long walk thank you so much
