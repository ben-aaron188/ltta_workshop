I would not recommend smashing your eye
but if you want to smush your eye
okay stop you hello friends and welcome
to another video today I'm going to be
testing out three eyeliner hat product
so basically these products are designed
to help you get that perfect cat eye
Queen there's no agent in wing I just
winged it's fun to say now I'm someone
who enjoys eyeliner quite a bit
specifically the cat eye flick or the
wing but I still mess up quite often
sometimes you just can't nail the angle
at which the cat eye should be one eyes
looking good the other eye is well
flaccid so if there is a product out
there that can help me nail the perfect
cat eye wing every single time
I want to know about it so hopefully we
can find that today in this eyeliner
hack product showdown the product we
have competing here today are the liner
designer pro by Beauty Blender the vamp
sale I I think the companies also called
vamps stamps and the eye candy eyeliner
sinful by best vendor Beauty we'll see
who comes out on top of the eyeliner
pyramid the eyeliner tournament the
eyeliner cat fight alright let's begin
so I'm going to start off with the liner
designer Pro like a little rubber ish
guitar picks things so they give you
like a little guitar pick holder with a
little mirror inside oh it's like a
magnifying mirror that's terrifyingly up
close so I want a cat eye flick from
this and what they say is to place the
straitlaced edge which i think is this
longer edge right here along the angle
created by the lower lid to act as a
guide for your cat eye slit so I'm
taking my eyeliner that I currently use
which is the Lancome art liner look at 6
per second and I'm going to try and see
if this is gonna work so my current
eyeliner hack is to draw a line of
concealer from the outer corner of my
eye to the edge of my eyebrow and I
think that is also the hack of this
thing I know right
doesn't seem like I did I think that
that that was a bad first stroke my
first mistake was maybe going in like
pretty liberally with the eyeliner just
cuz I think that some eyeliner got
underneath the stencil I'm just going to
go in and try the other side then we'll
fix that side okay that's definitely
that's definitely less messy let's try
and draw in the whole eyeliner now so
once you've got your initial angle the
next step is to take the curvalicious
side and you put it on top and then
trace it that way
there is a little bit of free-handing
you have to do with this like it's not
just going to give you the whole wing
like you definitely have to work with it
this side needs some help but this side
came out pretty well I'm just going to
start from scratch on this side right
here though I like the use of doing it
like this as a little help using it to
fill in your liner like this is very
difficult because you're trying to put
like a flat thing on a curved eyeball
that was the same as the other side I
don't think so not quite it's a little
frustrating because that's my main issue
with eyeliner in general it's not being
able to get them even I think that this
leaves a little bit of room for user
error like I can get under the liner
designer with my eyeliner a bit too
easily I like the the elegant cat eye
that this liner designer creates and it
could be a helpful addition to your
eyeliner routine but I don't think that
this solves all my eyeliner problems
let's move on to contestant number two
the bail sale so basically this is an
eyeliner stamp and you just you dip it
in ink and then you just stamp it on
it's got a little bit of a Darth Maul
vibe to it and I also I got the medium
wings tail this is what it says on the
box it says he struggle for the perfect
wing ends here fighting words so let me
take off this eyeliner I've got on from
the the liner designer Pro and then
we'll try this bad boy on for size so I
bought the ink that they had on their
website it's called the zinc eyeliner
ink whew oh it is it's like it is
actually ink like I thought it was going
to be like a gel the last time we
started with the right and the right was
a little bit of a mess so let's start
with the left so I'm just dunking it in
alright here we go ready
I think they've got a little like divot
here so I'm going to put that at the
corner of my eyes
it looks to me a little bit like a fin I
think that I must have done something
wrong I didn't quite get that good scoop
then the directions say to dip the
angled brushes they gave you and finish
out the line this way it definitely has
the length of a wing it doesn't quite
got the flick so I'm going to try the
other side now you know I want to see if
I can get that good flick because
there's a good flick shape here
no that was bad I did a bad job this one
actually had a little bit of a better
shape but I went too low I'm going to
try and take not as much ink I think one
of the reasons that I lose the curvature
is because I got too much ink oh you
know what I'm going to try and paint on
being that's going to be the best thing
to do I just want to get one good stamp
oh that's better
yeah that looks pretty good this was a
less good stamping but it is the better
shape you know I'm going to take off the
wing on this side let's try it this is
does it take four with any new makeup
product there is a learning curve so I
don't blame the vamp stamp for like
taking a second for me to figure it out
it looks pretty good we're improving
I think the technique of using the brush
to paint on the van stamp ink is
probably the way I would recommend just
cuz I was getting too much ink by just
dunking it all right now I'm just gonna
use my eyeliner and paint in the rest
the eyeliner here what do you guys
thanks to the look even I feel like I
stamped this one slightly higher than
this one but if you don't look too hard
it looks pretty good and even took me a
few tries to get a result that I was
pleased with but I think overall the
vamp stamps got the right idea the fact
that you can have uniform and
symmetrical length width and shape is
really important and I think that's
really cool you just have to be sure
that you're putting it at the same
height on both sides but I do I do like
how it turned out I think it looks
actually pretty close to the kind of
eyeliner that I usually go for so the
last eyeliner hack product is the eye
candy stencil pack this kind of operates
like painters tape in which you put down
a stencil you stick it on and then you
paint the eyeliner over it and then you
peel the simple off
so here are the stencil
haha sound like a sticker pack so I'm
going to wipe off the vamps stamp
eyeliner and then we're going to head on
into this one so basically what it says
is to carefully place eyeliner stencil
over your eyelid with eye open or closed
depending on preference there we go
feel like I look like I just got out of
the hospital so I said just to do to
apply the other side as well I'm trying
hard not to tape my eyes shut that's
almost like a Hunger Games look maybe
less be ever in your favor
I've heard of putting tape here as a
guideline
besides these stencils I've never really
seen this kind of painters tape method
let's keep the suspense going I'm going
to go in for the other eye I do love the
efficiency of this brush they give you
it's just like covering surface area
pretty quick I feel like if you got used
to matching the stencils and really
nailing the stencil placement this could
be really fast all right ready I'm going
to peel off my right eye first okay I
mean that's eyeliner right it's quite a
thick line it looks pretty good
alright ready for the other one oh that
one's much worse I feel like we've been
1 for 2 at every single eye so far I
actually think that the right eye turned
out pretty ideal like I think this is
the way it's supposed to look and then I
peeled off the left eye and it was just
like alright I'm going to I'm going to
try this I again I think this I turned
out pretty well I'm going back in for
left eye I'm never going to take off
some of your eyebrow you know I just
thought about that this first time I
don't know what happened and this time I
think I put the stencil too far in
because it's not quite as nice and
elongated as that winged with Rosa I'm
gonna try it one more time and then
we're going to see who comes out on top
if it's me or the stencil once more into
the breach dear friends once more
alright ready
I'm a little sad unlike the stamp where
as I kept trying I got better I think as
I keep trying with the stencil and keep
getting worse it's not the stencil I
think it's me because the stencil came
out so nicely on this side I think
though based on how this one looks if
you could figure out how to nail putting
these stencils down you can do really
cool eyeliner you could do different
colors you could do it ombre gradient
like this could be awesome trying to
redo this side without being able to
look at how the stunt works place on
this side it just wasn't working for me
I think that the first attempt was more
even but I clearly got under the stencil
somehow and had a giant bump and easel I
really did try you guys a little
crestfallen so the idea behind these
products is that they make it easier for
anyone to nail their eyeliner but
particularly for beginners so I was
thinking who the beginner at eyeliner
that I know Tyler so Tyler's going to
come in and try on my current
frontrunner which is the vise stamp and
see what he thinks about that they're
not a beginner I mean I've Johnny I mean
I dig the Kylie Jenner video I know I
did a pretty good job this is an
eyeliner since you were here you thought
me you said I was actually showing you I
and I agree that this was the clear
winner my heart too so I'm going in with
my left eye liner first here we go I
want to get into my eye and okay so
apparently it's not as easy as I thought
it was so I'm trying to get a bit more
ink on this guy now let's go going in
here
that was some premature stamping yeah oh
yeah yeah I'm just gonna have the same
angle on both sides but up till looks
like a little poo
I'm actually going to skip Saffy attack
here I'm going to just dip it right in
oh yeah
clean placement and did you stick the
landing
whoo pretty good right that might have
been bad yours okay this is actually
mom's sphaghetti don't choke here yeah I
think is pretty even right wow you were
great I think that one's a little higher
than the other one okay but I think that
you did a pretty damn good job okay so
since Tyler was able to recreate
essentially what is better than my
result with his right eye so good I
think that the vamp stamp is the winner
of this test I think that Tyler did a
pretty damn good job I think that all
three of them have different advantages
and I think that all three of them are
pretty cool so even though the ban stamp
is the winner of this showdown today
gone with gauntlet I do think that both
the liner designer and the eyeliner
stencils have their own advantages I
don't think I'm going to stop just doing
my island or by hand I think that
usually that gets the job done but I
think we can incorporate these guys into
the routine to try it up the eyeline I
think that I'm going to be using the
stamps going forward if you guys have
used any of these products please let me
know in the comments below let me know
