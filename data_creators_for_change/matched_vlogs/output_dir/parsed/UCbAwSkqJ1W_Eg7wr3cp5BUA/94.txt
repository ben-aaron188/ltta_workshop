I wonder if you really just sort of
started watching one of these videos
like right in the middle and you just
heard me immediately say let's cover our
buttholes you just feel like I've
discovered the weird part of YouTube
hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm going to be trying out
to the Anastasia or Auto Saskia Beverly
Hills lip palette only one this lip
palette came out a couple of months ago
and there were a fair share of articles
written about it and I have been
intrigued by it ever since the palette
cost forty eight dollars and there are
eighteen shades inside and the idea
behind it is basically that you can make
any lip color that your heart desires by
mixing these colors together now you
guys might know that I'm something of a
lipstick skein I love wearing lipsticks
anything from super bold colors to
brownie news I love news I've also
gotten my own custom lipsticks made
before which was super cool because I
basically got to like hone in on the
shades that I really wanted so I'm
excited to do some more mixing but also
to have the spatula in my untrained hand
I'm not a makeup artist so I'm not
someone who use this during photo shoots
or on client I would want to use this
during my everyday life so I'm going to
see if I can mix something up tonight
recreate it tomorrow see how long it
lasts and see how difficult or easy it
is to re-up that color throughout the
course today alright I think we should
just get mixing I mean probably first
open it but then mix so basically inside
there you get a palette with all the
colors in it and then inside the palette
you get a lip brush one side of it is
like the brush and the other side is the
spatula for sort of gouging and mixing
and then here you have a little like
mixing sheet oh my god it is just close
to the magnet oh I love when palettes
clothes of magnet Oh off to a good start
I'm a little bit nervous to begin
because all of these colors look so nice
untouched I think that I'm going to go
for something a little bit wild just
because I think like something that
could be really cool about this palette
is to go for the lip colors that you are
too afraid to commit to a full size up
I've always wanted to try like a women
lavender color but I've never known if
it would look good on me
I've seen uh some full-size lipsticks
that are the kind of that color so I
would go for blue white and this purple
color oh I'm so nervous being so me you
will see here no no I'm never sure I
want to press the button Ted oh we're
there instructions in the box
mix-and-match these intensely pigmented
long wearing shades to customize an
endless array of looks so know well they
were just like a while yo all right so
I'm starting to mix it is kind of that
periwinkle that I was kind of thinking
of a pretty quick process to mixing that
I would say like a minute oh wow
oh well you know what I realized I think
I've made my like fourth grade dream
color I was a purple gal when I was a
kid I used to wear a giant purple
sweatshirt the Fed Gap Kids this is
really nice feeling on my lips
definitely not super super matte but
it's not shiny I kind of love it but I
also kind of feel like I have a Katy
Perry wig on my face it definitely makes
my teeth look kind of yellow but there's
something really fun about it and I
definitely don't go in a color like this
okay so this is possibility number one
for tomorrow I'm gonna you know quickly
wash this brush off and come up with a
couple more options and we'll see what
you know what's really tickling our
fancy I'm going to mix up like a teal
color I have a couple of green lipsticks
and a couple of blue lipsticks but I
don't have anything like in the middle
this isn't turning out the way I want it
to all right I'm going to do another
take on this teal color this is closer
to I think what I meant
do you like a darker blue color yeah I
keep realized I don't really know what
teal looks like are you color blind are
you lowly called maybe I'm just going to
add like a tiny smidge of white you know
I think I hit pan already I see the
bottom of the pan you're taking way too
much hot sauce
no not but I kind of like it there's
something like stormy about it it's got
a little bit of Finding Nemo vibe to it
I think it's a purple was really fun and
different and something that I would
totally use this palette for because I
don't think I would buy a full version
of it this color is kind of something
that I want in a full version alright
let's make sure we get that butthole
cover so this is option number two going
for kind of a Finding Nemo
on the pallet it looks kind of like a
sea turtle color so it called it crush
but on the face it looks a little bit
bluer I'm going to call this one how
about Bruce's Bruce's father I never
knew who my father is a good guy
Bruce is misunderstood he just got away
so that nosebleed can help himself
happens to me too
that's good alright so let's try and
make a color that doesn't involve white
or blue so I can you know let them have
a break especially if I choose one of
these two colors for tomorrow let's try
something fiery something more you know
riffing door knock all right and then I
take one swipe of this one all right
let's see what happens when I mix this
together doesn't it look like Quidditch
robes those acquitted robes okay so I'm
going to take this color which I'm
tentatively title and all over wood I
don't know why Quidditch robes always
come to mind and ever I'm mixing lip
colors it's just it's always right there
I don't know what that says about me
maybe I'm just a Quidditch groupie so
looking at these three colors I think
I'm going to go with a Finding Nemo
color for tomorrow I really do love the
other colors too I might put on the
sweatshirt color just one last time just
for fun let's go to bed and tomorrow
morning we're going to try and recreate
the sharp color the Finding Nemo stuff
you know I'm talking about
that's a cat here inside of this how did
that happen okay so it is tomorrow I
mean today I mean the next day and I've
done the rest of my makeup so it's time
for me to try and remix my Finding Nemo
teal shade my brucey Bruce color I wipe
everything off of my mixing plate
besides the desired teal color so I'm
going to go into the blue first alright
so I'm taking some yellow pigment now I
remember yesterday I took some yellow
and I had to take some more so I'm
trying to give myself a meager yet
generous amount of yellow all right and
then I'm mixing them together I don't
know how much of mixing you guys could
see but actually that's not actually how
far off I don't think I know that with
this color I put in a little bit of
white at the end just a little bit to
bring it a little bit lighter maybe you
could use a tiny bit more blue as well
it's literally this much baby bit of
blue
this is simultaneously like a kind of
expensive product but also like a DIY
type feel so you got the best of you
this is the old color and that's the new
color I mean we might as well throw it
on my face and see if I did it right you
know what I'm not sure this is perfect
it kind of looks a little bit greener
it's pretty Dern close so this is my
Bruce color
here's Brucie I think I did a pretty
good job matching it fish our friends
not suit oh my god oh my god I just put
my finger in everything I also will say
that I made a little bit of a better
amount this time last time I didn't
really make enough and this time I made
enough to like use almost all of it up
but not be like scraping the bottom for
it I'm going to put this in a ziplock
bag and try and take it with me so I can
at least have this to reference so I
think that it was actually pretty doable
to recreate a very similar if not
exactly the same color I think the real
test will be how long will this stuff
last on my face because I'm about to go
out get some coffee hang around later on
going to dinner going to take my
supplies go to school getting on go to
school anymore let's go get some coffee
and see what a straw does to old brucy
old brucy ol boy so I had a reward at
Starbucks so I went all out and then I
realized I already had coffee a few
hours ago so I'm about to get rich
there's definitely residue on the straw
but how does the mouth look not too
shabby
I'm going to keep drinking this and by
the end when I'm incredibly caffeinated
we'll check again and see if the sort of
repeated straw motion really did
anything to me okay so as I finished
this coffee even though I see a lot of
lipstick on the straw there's not too
much fade I think that the lipsticks
winning this round I'm meeting a new
friend for dinner and I got a couple
hours before I have to meet her I don't
think she would mind too much if my
lipstick ended up all over my face but
we don't know each other bad well so
there's always that element of it
the lipstick doesn't look as opaque as
it did when I first put it on but it's
not smearing its fading grace
so I'm going to head in to dinner and
hopefully the lipstick will survive okay
so I'm in the bathroom at the restaurant
for a quick re-up this is the damage
after edamame and Kung Pao shrimp I
honestly thought the damage would be way
worse like when I was eating I was like
I feel it moving like it's going to be
just everywhere but looking at it like
I'm honestly impressed right now I want
to see if I can like Rhea a little bit I
am I am palate and my mixing plate okay
so I'm going to take a few parts blue
with my of your left hey got some paper
towel here okay
hoping that nothing falls into the sink
and now it's everything now the back of
this is wet Oh why's my foot sticking to
the ground all right going to take a
little bit of glue take a tad of yellow
and then I already know I need a hat of
white you think tad is the best like a
unit of measure it's already been four
minutes oh she definitely time to think
slowly it's a little too blue I need a
little bit more yellow I think that
after six minutes I have got my new crop
but I can really make let's see what you
guys think if anything because I
actually don't think the damage was too
bad but whipping up a new crop is not
that easy is it a perfect match thank
you bad even though there are a lot of
like moving pieces terms of logistics
and stuff
the end result I'm really impressed by
it has been 10 minutes and 33 seconds
but I do think Bruce is back in fighting
shape okay so it is the end of the day
I've had this on for about eight hours
of course you guys saw me reapply it so
I've reapplied once I was actually
generally really impressed by how long
it stayed on I think you actually could
wear this out in your everyday life I
wouldn't necessarily recommend grubbing
like I definitely think the eating did
affect it to the point where I was like
I would want to reapply I also thought
it wasn't too hard to recreate the
shades but like it's not super easy to
do on the go if you don't have enough
space my main issue is the quantity of
each little pant I've already used up a
lot of the blue and the white and even
like the yellow at this point like even
from just today and yesterday you know
if I want to like rebuy a couple pans I
wouldn't want to have to rebuy the whole
palette or anything like that but in
general pretty impressed had a good time
felt like I had a giant box of crayons
and loved it and this did satisfy some
lipstick themed inside of me I also like
kind of want this color in a full-sized
