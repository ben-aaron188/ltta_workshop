just got home and I'm gonna explain to
you guys how everything went with my dad
hamdulillah he's all fine
right now so I landed yesterday from
London to New York City I got I landed
around maybe 8:00 9:00 p.m. my dad's my
dad's surgery was at 6 p.m. so I learned
it kind of late I got straight and went
straight almost straight to the hospital
right away so when I was cheated Ospital
I was I was kind of curious as like why
isn't my dad doing the surgery so far he
was having a heart surgery and the
reason why I was having a heart
surgeries to have like a checkup because
he's having another surgery and to have
that surgery to have that surgery he
needs to make sure that his heart is
good to have that surgery so he didn't
take the surgery was supposed to be at 6
p.m. so I got there I was around maybe
like it was almost 10 I landed on 8 and
I got there on almost 10 and I was on
through I got there and my dad was
bugging out like my dad was going so
crazy he was so worried about surgery
and he was already so so mad because he
hasn't started his surgery his surgery
was four hours late and then when he
told me the story about why I was late I
got really really angry at all the
doctors and stuff like that so his
surgeries would be at 6 p.m. he wasn't
allowed to eat 8 hours before the
surgery so that means he hasn't ate
since 10:00 a.m. in the morning so he
has aces 10:00 a.m. in the morning and
it's already 6:00 p.m. and they said no
you have to wait till 10 p.m. because
something went on with the doctors room
that they needed change the room the
doctor came late so they need to have a
10 10 p.m. my dad is 65 years old so my
dad was saying then can I please go eat
or change the surgery or do something to
another dick because I haven't ate four
hours I'm so hungry I can't have
diabetes I need to eat something
so they're like no we're gonna do we
have to do surgery today you have to do
it you cannot just hold your whole year
like just don't eat they were saying so
my dad was legit going crazy he was
telling him like he was telling do you
like do you want me to die what's wrong
I need to go eat I can't have a nothing
I feel like I don't feel well so well
but they forced him they were literally
telling him no you cannot eat you have
to wait till 10:00 p.m. and then my
whole family was there they were telling
him just wait don't buy the doctors all
right just wait for it and I was
really angry on speaking with the
dachshund makan how you gonna do it how
you gonna tell my dad to wait another
four hours when he has even eight four
eight hours but I'd handed like he still
got it through at 10 p.m. he started the
surgery it was about an hour too long
process
he finished the surgery he went to the
recovery room and at the recovery room
he was laying down and he was supposed
to lay down for about four or five hours
you could even move he had to lay down
straight like this he had to keep his
legs straight he could have moved so
while he was laying down he was in the
recovery room
and my whole family uh went to go see
like talk to him how did everything go
everything was fine and him to LA I
would a loved one with that he would
you'd crack jokes you know you'd be
funny and laugh to the doctors he was
like I'm because he started I have a so
he thought that I haven't ate please I
want a seat I want a CD literally say
that which like it made me crack smile
but seeing my dad in that position was
so so scary and this was the most
scariest part of my life that I've ever
seen a mother because I have never no
one in my life has ever who's closing
has ever like passed away that that's
one thing I'm so afraid like that's one
thing I'm scared of someone like one of
my loved ones when my family was passing
away like my grandma passed away but she
passed when I was younger so was it
really like close close to me she was
close to him but like I was younger I
didn't really know much stuff like that
so one one thing I'm really afraid of is
basically just losing my family losing
my loved one somebody so my dad was
laying down there and he had all this
like Oh like just little doctor like
kind of stuff on everything was going
and yet all those little things that
rings at thank Dan Dan like for his
heart being heard and I sees heart beat
on me was 74 it was good he was laying
down he kept saying I'm hungry I'm
hungry again and the doctors like you
still can't eat for another two hours
because you can't have their surgery my
dad was like please look I'm starving I
haven't ate for so long like something
like I need something or anything
they're like like you cannot eat you
have to wait a bit something like that I
kept yelling at the dogs on please give
my dad some food give him something and
they would say no he has to wear all
something is gonna go wrong so all my
whole family was they were telling me to
stop do not eat just wait after like 20
30 minutes while my dad was in the
recovery room laying down we were
talking with him everything I was
talking all the side
and he just stopped talking and he just
started like closing his eyes and slowly
going down like this and I seen in his
face like his skin color sort of like
change like started turning really pale
his sweat came out like so much sweat
was coming out of his head and I was
looking at my dad's heart rate it went
from 74 and I went down to about 68 then
I went down again to like 62 then I went
down again to like 50 something then I
went down against like 40 and then
something started beeping really really
loud one doctor came to check up on my
dad and my dad was just laying down he's
trying to speak but he couldn't he was
like what's wrong what's wrong what's
wrong with me
I knew sweating sore and I started
touching my dad I was grabbing his neck
I was like a bat wake up wake up and
he's like what's wrong what's wrong my
little brother came is like say that I'm
loved say that my dad would scream me
like nah like I love that I mean he's
like slowly sleeping I was I was so so
scared I thought like like I thought
like I thought um I don't know I just
thought I thought was like my dad's I
thought it was my dad's last breaths of
his life it was just so so scared I
didn't know what to do I was holding
onto my dad I told the doctors to come
out scream at doctor screaming at my dad
as a wake up wake up then all of a
sudden all the doctors came and I'm one
of the doctors and they were giving him
like a shot and giving him something in
his body and like he ended up like just
going like that his heart rate went back
up more from 20 packs like 17 like
literally like a couple seconds I my dad
started waking up his sweat started
going away and handling he went back to
like life and he looked and he started
telling us what happened and I said
about wake up wake up and started
speaking back to me I was I was in
complete shock like I did not I didn't
know what to do it was so so scary
