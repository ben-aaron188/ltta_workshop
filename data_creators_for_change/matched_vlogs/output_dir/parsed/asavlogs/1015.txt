hey guys what's up and uma Ganga hope
you're all having an amazing day because
I'm having the maze name so if I'm
having an amazing day you should be
having an amazing day I know you guys
are all probably wondering in the title
it says Thanksgiving with our families
but wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
us Muslims we do not celebrate
Thanksgiving but Thanksgiving seems like
a really really cool holiday to anybody
who celebrates Thanksgiving but for us
Muslims Thanksgiving is every single day
because we're always thankful that's why
we pray five times a day every single
day so today I decided to do a little
skit for you guys instead of
Thanksgiving with our families I'm gonna
make it like gatherings with our
families this is what happens in Arab
gatherings feel this music right
okay first of all the day before the
gathering my sisters or like any girl
would be cleaning up the whole house
making sure it's crispy clean so when
the guests come the next day has to be
super clean for them I have to clean
every single day this is not right mom
this is like slavery 2015 you know what
I'm gonna do I'm gonna run away i'ma run
away from home mm-hmm I don't know way
the only place you're gonna run away to
is to your room cuz I'm gonna come get
you right now yeah I'm going mad
sometimes the ladies can't even sit down
and eat they always have to be up giving
out the food coming back washing dishes
vacuuming clean up that getting another
couple oranges doing this doing that
like I feel so bad
that's all the men out there if you guys
don't help out the ladies then you will
know Punk always help out it doesn't
matter if you're a guy imagine if we US
guys were in their position but we had
to clean we had to clean all night all
day never sit down
what did you want the woman to help you
know help you clean this up like that so
just put yourself in their shoes and
help them out during Arab gatherings
my mom would seriously bring the whole
Yemen to my house you'd call up the
whole summer shoe Club the hotels show
Kolbe the whole I then should call the
whole shit she'll bring them all to the
house it gets so crowded in the house
more crowded in Times Square if you guys
take the red stairs Times Square is
really crowded try going into our
gathering it gets so so crowd you came
in move it's like a maze when you're
walking after a whole three hours when
your whole family's in house and some
people who do did not even know who was
your families in house you have to send
them to every single person and it gets
so so awkward because some of them are
woman and you do not know like since
they're family you can touch their hand
to give them a handshake but you don't
know because it gets awkward so
sometimes for me will get so so awkward
like I'll go up like my aunt or my
cousin I'd be like assalamualaikum don't
feel so funny like you know no no not
touching hands and I'm just like okay
I'm high five but she's like you I
thought you you know if I get faced oh
my goodness I'm just there like okay how
about an air five oh my god yo u and v
and v is still hot on me I'm making new
head I had up you know what I'm gonna
just high-five myself after you sell
them to everybody another 100 people
come to your house
who are extra late they comes you have
to sell them to them to all the grown
old men they're the ones who come
extra extra late they come to the house
I have to go in there and sell them to
them I have to kiss their heads kiss her
sweaty heads matter of fact and when I
kissed her sweaty bald heads it tastes
like it tastes like the ocean I'm not
even joking their sweat tastes like like
the ocean I don't know the Dead Sea the
Red Sea I don't I don't even know but
seriously do you guys need a wipe your
sweat before I go and kiss your heads
are a matter of fact I'm a carrion
napkin every time I'm gonna sell them
for you guys so before I kiss you hasn't
me to be like ooh poo and then six hours
later when everyone is finally the house
and super late the food is still not
ready so everyone is there starving and
waiting for the food four and a half
hours later the food is finally ready
and the whole family comes up together
and they're about to eat all together
and this is the part this is the most
Awkward part when everyone is eating
together but I find it the most fun part
but still the most awkward and the most
like dramatic the most craziest part
ever and i'ma tell you why you always
had that uncle bragging about his son
being the most amazing son in the world
but you know damn sure he's not the best
son in the world
