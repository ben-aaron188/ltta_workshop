hey guys I'm Adam solid and I'm with the
police sergeant to bury a plate of NYPD
today we're gonna be doing London on
Muslims hashtag I once a voice as your
to say Eddie
hey guys what's your name I'm Joe Luke
trolly Dillon nice can you see Charlie
again Charlie can you see charlie bit me
charlie bit me wow that's good Sebastian
Alania Trevor Robin Mateo Liam what do
you think about Muslims I think that
it's a religion they should be able to
believe what they want to believe like I
haven't got anything against any
religion so I don't know it was like
it's a really it's the same religion and
it's like Christianity Judaism it's the
same as anything there's nothing
different about them for a religion I
quite like them because my neighbors
Muslim she's very nice
so I don't know any Muslims so I don't
know what to think about them me and Joe
Varia are actually Muslim so were the
first Muslim people you know now I know
we're cool you know what I'm saying you
know they're just normal people but this
yeah same as I do anybody else
I'm almost in myself so I have any
issues with a few things will come to my
wedding because I'm using existing of
terrorists and things are there and I
was supposed to kill yeah I met a lot of
Muslim people I work with Muslim people
as well so I actually nothing nothing
strange like I've got no problem it's a
religion for example I'm Italian
you're Muslim for example which is the
problem do you think that police should
speak to young Muslim kids to ask them
how they feel about radicalization and
like Islamophobia when young when other
people take fun out of Muslims for being
Muslim yeah I support it it's helping
them in a way because it's always
there's always stereotypes about how
like they're different and everything
but they're not like it's just a
religion and the way what in it what
they believe in
yeah they're just normal people like all
of us but just because they're Muslim
doesn't make them any different it
should be not only with young people
should be with everybody that is like
Islamophobic I think it's very very good
idea to do that because if if police
help people how to handle with the young
people I think it's good idea yeah as
far as I should marry you
let's you know speaks them a little bit
but hey you know I think people just a
bit worried when you see them in groups
today you just get a bit worried about
it only I suppose but yeah I guess yeah
definitely do you have children I do yes
I do yeah would you allow them to come
and work with us on this initiative oh
yeah and I think they'd be pleased to
them they're very sensible young lady so
I think that we please - yeah certainly
thank you very much I'm a school teacher
so I I see teach whistling children and
we do a lot of work with teachers so
it's really good to know I'll definitely
agree with that because I think there's
some that are now I would say majority
of them know what they're doing they're
doing the right thing and there's a
smaller man it just needs to be taught
that what they're doing is wrong as well
so yeah definitely I think working with
him would be a good thing so how does it
meet a Muslim in in London I don't live
here we've come here for today from from
Birmingham so I am going the issues
don't have any issues whatsoever I've
got family here I'm always here how does
it feel being a Muslim in Birmingham
pretty good yeah pretty good I can't
complain how is it living in London and
being a Muslim I feel I feel I feel good
because I believe my religion at
hamdullah a Muslim so I'm not gas to
nobody so I believe Who I am if somebody
being not nice with me I can handle it
like a sum I'm paying with some baby you
know so for me hamdu lillah
I'm not gas nobody I love my religions
peace I love that's it so terrorist
comes in mind we need when someone says
Muslims no just just that it's just
everyone's got this thing about you know
terrorism
you know you see people are gonna call
these barrels on a stuff holiday you
know use a bit Freud it's a bit you get
bit wary of things like that but that's
that's like part of the that's why the
religion they wear it so they won't show
anyone that you want to show they're
like husband's and they choose their
options I know it's not like they're
forced to do it cuz their options but
people a bit wary when I see you gotta
be honest about it you know I mean it's
you know various away is so you know
probably in the Muslim country or
whatever is it's normal
well what about like when you see a nun
I swear I could wearing that well what
do you think
see if ice yeah but they do the same
thing that where her job you can still
see their face well alright thank you so
much
is there any message you guys would like
to say to all the Muslim people watching
around the world right now any message
don't listen to everyone who's saying
that you're negative people cuz you're
not you are the same as everyone else
just ignore them you want to be it's not
because you're Muslim it means that your
bed I mean everyone can be bet it
doesn't matter which religion you're
following you have to be yourself you
don't be shy that you are Muslim or
other religion you had to be really
yourself don't worry just stupid people
the thing that and they are manipulated
by the media just stick together in this
time I know that things aren't looking
good for us right now in a manner of
what's going on around the world but at
the same time we're not doing nothing
wrong for ourselves he's just a small
minority that are but just stick
together and everything each other
everything would be good inshallah thank
you so much sorry and just keep working
hard and stay strong I suppose and I
hope for all the Muslims very nice life

needed peace for all Muslims
