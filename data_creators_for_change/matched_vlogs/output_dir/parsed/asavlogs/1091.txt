Hey
all right guys so it's time to wrap up
this vlog hope you all enjoyed this vlog
I know this vibe is kind of short but
this just isn't my week at all I feel
like I don't know I just feel I just
feel so down and I blame myself for all
of this it's all my fault for feeling
down and feeling this way and I'm not
just saying that so you guys can feel
bad if like that because it truly is my
fault and I blame myself for how I'm
feeling this week it was supposed to be
an amazing week and it is this is going
on amazing but I just I just feel down
that right I just feel down so yeah it
has been going amazing today in the
meeting went amazing it was so positive
so amazed as of now with the
boxer-briefs modeling thing yesterday
some of you guys got it all wrong just
because the title was I'm becoming an
underwear model a lot of you guys just
judged it by the title and started like
making this crazy comments but I am NOT
I already canceled canceled everything I
told the people of that company do not
release any pictures of me I will not
release any pictures of myself I've
changed my decision I will not be doing
it and I'm not just doing it because I'm
saying oh you guys I don't want no
negative energy out of my doing by the
way letting the negative people get to
you but I did realize I didn't make a
stupid decision so I can't so I'm not
gonna do it all that is gone but I'm
still I'm still feeling down I don't
know I just feel like you know those
moves when you feel so down and just
like you don't do nothing you shouldn't
stay in bed and do nothing
I've been in bed a little like for five
hours took a little nap and I don't know
it's just it's just I feel like I feel
like I let a lot of you guys down and
like that and there's some stuff I do
not even want to talk about cuz some
people jump straight into conclusions
like I know I smoke hookah I know I
smoke Kisha I do not smoke weed do drugs
I do not drink alcohol do none of that I
mean I don't blame some of you guys for
think of that cuz a lot of people are
like oh you look like you drink by the
way you dress oh you look like a player
by the way you dress oh you look like
you smoke weed by the way you dress so
I'm like how should I dress to not look
like to look like a good person I mean
yes I know who gives a heck what the
people say who who gives a what
people think I stuff like that but
sometimes sometimes does get to me it
makes me feel like down but I just feel
like I need some I need some alone time
so today and tomorrow I'm just gonna be
chilling and having some alone time
maybe going out and just chillin
hopefully all goes well and I promise
you guys I will be back tomorrow with an
amazing vlog or the day after too

just gonna be chillin I'm sorry for
whatever if anyone is being mad at
friend in with the boxer briefs or with
anything I'm not doing the boxer briefs
model anything anymore not doing it just
cause are you gonna get hate cuz it's
doing it if I wanted to do it I would
have done it but I realized it was a
stupid decision and what was I doing
like yeah but I just hate being so
stressed I just want to make people
smile and when I see me doing the
opposite to people it just I feel like I
feel guilty I feel like I'll let you
like I let a lot of people down if I
made them feel bad so I apologize for
that and I'm so sorry and I promise
nothing stupid like that will happen
yeah if anything stupid happens again I
promise you guys can come and you guys
