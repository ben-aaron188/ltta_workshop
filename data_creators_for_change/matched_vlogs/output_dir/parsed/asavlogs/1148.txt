here in the emergency medical aid of of
the heat wave
how you doing the very other people died
in this area yeah so

there's some of the medical patients go
into that
three medical camp karachi for the tree
number 43 that's crazy
this guy wanted 124 and they wait until
their number goes in yeah you have to
wait until the number goes in and they
go in there and get treated and it's
like really hot here like I can't just
knowing I can't use their two minutes to
the fact the same hours and hours of
waiting is just crazy much low you guys

about tens of thousands people in the
