home oh well hope you hope you get some
success today I hope you got some vacuum
and so for Ringo I need it thank you so
much oh yes for that I don't
what would you think Ranga is I'm
assuming because it allows Muslim girls
around you ever to do this love I figure
well no but I you can look good so you
used to be Muslim yeah so happening
that's not for camera John that's a long
conversation learning station yeah I
will talk after this you don't want to
say you're sorry about that I'll be
interesting I mean cause it was on my
lunch hour lucky for him would be
interesting to know I just I was born
Muslim went to Arab explained everything
not very long time my like it did then
at one point so I moved back to Latin
huh yeah and I started doing research
from my own yeah I one thing one thing I
came to understand is that majority of
Muslims are only Muslim because that's
what they know they're born into it now
we know a lot no no I mean the gender of
like that you're born into the religion
yeah so you kind of your your method of
learning is always going to be happy
Islam as a superior yeah but we also
learn like we can read the Bible I
didn't like that too yes that but I felt
like it was limited in terms of the
information I knew about other images I
went to research it myself I want to
know who God was and why people need the
world and one day so eventually I tend
to good standing yeah ultimately I felt
that I respect that you know I said I
don't know I just I was being the
seems more like something to see yes
what everybody
you're probably because it's Tom is more
like peaceful you never get you see in
Islam but I respect you and everything
you five around the wrong people there's
some Muslims who they don't represent
Islam hear me and let's say friends is
Isis in or presents non-personal and
there's some Muslims around who do crazy
stuff like me I'm Muslim banner of Islam
Islam itself it's it's represented by
such a religion so don't feel that way
and I thank them but you do ever want to
talk anything that you know hi guys I'm
going to be wrapping up the vlog here
because we had a whole huge meeting with
our risks that's been going on the place
