tonight for my Birmingham show but my
flight got canceled but the weirdest
thing happened they booked me a new
flight but the flight is now before what
I was supposed to normally take but it's
kind of weird because this play that I
was supposed to take at 11 p.m. tonight
got cancelled because of the snow look
at this north side that is look man it
just started snowing crazy so now my
flight is at 5 p.m. earlier six hours
earlier which is really really weird why
would they cancel my 11:00 p.m. flight
cuz of the snow and then I have a flight
now while it's snowing that's kind of
weird I feel like my flight is gonna be
canceled regardless at the end once I
get there watch I already know it's
gonna get canceled but the bad luck that
I have and now it's like no it's not
gonna get canceled it's not gonna get
kissed I know it's gonna get cancelled
