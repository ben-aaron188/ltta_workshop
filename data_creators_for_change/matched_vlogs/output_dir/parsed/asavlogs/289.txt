Adam you should have never had any shit
I've never hit him right now i'ma tell
you guys the reaction of my parents well
actually the whole Adams family reaction
to what happened yesterday so pretty
much everyone is with me for me they're
saying what you did was right because
they didn't want my dad to be the one
who gets knocked out or hurt so in my
dad's head and everyone like my whole
family's head they're like that's really
really good I defended your dad and that
you hit the guy because if I would have
never done that then that guy would have
hit my dad but my mom she's the old one
who's like oh my god you should have
never had it you should have just
blocked him and stuff like that but I
guess that's just that's just how my mom
is she hates it and I fight and stuff
and to be honest I never really fought
for like years like it's been so long
since I've fought but when this issue
happened when it happens to your own dad
I had no choice but to fight I didn't
know what to do I had no choice I've
seen a lot of you guys putting any
comments were like oh my god where's the
