old high school and my old middle school
they are both in the same building I
went to this school from 2005 until 2010
from seventh grade all the way until
twelfth grade and if you guys do not
know I see get bullied a lot for being
Muslim especially after 9/11 so the
first time ever that I entered the
school I told everyone then I was
Hispanic because I was so afraid if
people will start building me again for
being Muslim I used to have some crazy
crazy fights in the school I had fights
with teachers students principals
security guards I even got expelled from
the school and that also had a
restraining order in the school for five
years five years has gone by I could
come through I did a tweet about the
school the other day and one of my
teachers got in touch with me and this
teacher she's my favorite favorite
teacher she inspired me to be the man I
am today and she's allowing me to go
inside the school to say hi say what's
up to the students and to help our
students in their that went through the
same thing as I did never be afraid to
tell people where from always be proud
