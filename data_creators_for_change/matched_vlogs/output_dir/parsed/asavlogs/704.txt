so looking guys we're still looking
right now it's pretty hard looking for
someone like popped a laptop in New York
City NYC is literally huge so looking
for someone as I can possibly but by the
way he's gonna upload an update video
and I'm gonna have to edit for him
because he has half the laptop right now
so I'm upload that for him and then
after that he's gonna have more videos
coming soon hopefully when he gets a new
laptop and then he'll start uploading
because I supposed to come and teach him
how to upload but his laptop was gone
but we're looking for the thief right
now and we've been walking for a while
and it's hard but we go hopefully find
someone that's know
I'm seeing seeing longer than expected
but how many homeless people are there
in
for the nails of the cow
40,000 in County homeless people in New
York City so just counted 40,000 counts
so we're pretty much we're pretty much
looking 40,000 homeless people in New
York City so we have to look round about
I'm trying to do like my best
investigation he said around Madison
Avenue so I'm going around the Madison
Avenue line right now which is right
here so if you guys do not know Madison
Avenue has a lot of like homeless people
so and a lot of them know Jason is some
of them were his friends before but
after that some of them are his fake
friends which I tell you every single
every single time now stay away from
like because I know the people I know
the people who are like you can see it
in them you can see it another way the
shady initiate like that guy before
Wayne he seems cool he's chill he didn't
do nothing like he didn't ask her
nothing
that's why he gave him he didn't ask
other people they asked straight up but
like they just do the weird thing so
twice you'll see we got to have to catch
the person this is it's been like
walking around like two miles so far
this has been literally like over an
hour we're looking for the thief and
we're not we haven't found him but jason
said that there's a place where he
sleeps at but he's always there like
late late night and I can't make it late
night cuz I have to go out and see slim

and we're going to see hopefully you
seemed there but we haven't seen anyone
right now and we've been looking around
for an hour and we're getting hungry
so as Amana which is going to go eat
something and just enjoy the day me
