Daniel difficult to speak to
unfortunately the FAA requires us to
have a maximum amount of flight time and
a max amount of Duty time and they
regulate our rest time and as a result
we've now exceeded our duty day
that's the bad news good news though is
that they have two pilots ready to go
and so we're going to have the jet
bridge come up we're going to open the
door we're going to leave you're going
to have some pilots that we're supposed
to go somewhere else take you to our
land oh and then that's going to be
Macbeth when you bring more work from
off on us I mean you're happy to get out
the aircraft update your honor this day
sucks really but I feel that everyone on
this plane it's all good
gotta still smile
so we're talking with the managers right
now to figure out exactly what's going
to happen with regard to the d-o-t the
department transportation has specific
rules about how long you're allowed to
be on the airplane before you have to
get off the airplane have a chance to
rest and come back on so we're checking
into that right now with our managers
and we're checking the flight plan and
the fuelling and everything else I can
tell you there's a huge number of
airplanes out there we just came in from
this there's probably at least 50 or 60
airplanes waiting to take off right now
I don't know what the situation is going
to be I just want at least give you a
heads-up that calf and I are here the
plane is fueled obviously we're getting
our flight plan talking to dispatch and
getting an idea of what this is all
going to look like and as soon as we
have an idea here in the next few
minutes we'll give you an update on
whether or not you're gonna be getting
off the plane and getting back on or
what the plan is gonna be okay
I don't even know what's going on this
thing is just annoying I just want to
see I feel like going home and I don't
want to do nothing I apologize for the
delay for right now go ahead and stay in
the immediate vicinity of the gate I
don't really have any more information
on the security issue you may be able to
find out more looking at the internet or
whatever but for right now just stay in
the gate area we'll get you back on
board as quickly as we can if we do get
an update about any kind of
cancellations or anything like that
obviously they'll be announcing that
right there at the gate leave that
airplane now like it's confirmed leaving
there
yeah might get another plane might be
canceled
we're out of the airplane we've been
here literally around five six hours now
no no not like faster showers they're
supposed to be two three-hour journey
and it turns out being crazy shout out
to the homes from Manchester right here
they're waiting they're going to our
land or two but then man you think the
inter cancel it or not oh I hope they
don't cancel I'll be mad obviously so
after kids left is the way they cancel
you have to go back home we just gotta
wait subloan driven patience is key
it didn't say nothing but it yeah it
won't they won't say because they wanted
this they didn't want to get people
scared yeah and then so his family my
family seen the news and they opened the
news and people were shooting in this
terminal around here and they're doing
like an investigation that's the real
reason why we can't be going to stuff
like that because they keep saying
thunderstorm there's no thunderstorm or
nothing like that so and it shows right
here look see police respond to reports
of shots fired inside seminar JFK
Airport police responding 9:30 p.m.
witnesses they heard two shots fired
well what time is right now it's 10
o'clock what do you think gonna have
enough huh so Mohammed thinks this is
like punk teething Ashton Kutcher is
gonna comfortable and be like guys
you've been punked yeah I wish it I can
really happen but can't even make the
story up I know I owe mr. Kingston comes
in late
I know then you get on the plane here
they tell you
you know that we have to wait for the
other people to do oh my god and then
the storm then the Winchester pilots
have to get out yeah but the real reason
is the New Yorkers truly glad I don't
know it something happened but we'll be
good at doing
Oh passengers please stay exactly where
you are do not try to leave this
terminal and go over to the other side
wall suspended please to stay
please cooperate state
as we are now in the uber I founded la
pomme de la Hamlet thank you I love
everything right now is completely fine
everything was good I must show you guys
and explain to you guys what went on
from beginning to end because this is
the scariest thing that has ever
happened to me in my life the scariest
thing ever so we were on the plane going
to Orlando with all of us thought was
we're going I got delayed once and we
didn't know why they were saying it was
traffic those 50 to 60 airplanes and
something like that so everyone bought
that waited another like whole hour in
the airplane and then everyone was like
get out the airplane and wait outside
there's a security issue or something
like that and they were like check
online check out social media something
like that so once I heard them say that
I would go on Twitter and I just look up
JFK the first thing I see is that
terminal 8 there's been shots fired
no nobody know at the time it was a
false shot or whatever everyone at the
time was so scared because they said
breaking news shots fired in JFK and
terminal II wish to the terminal I was
in and there was another shot fired at
another terminal that was right next to
us so we're all scared waiting inside
the airport and then we hear the speaker
saying guys do not leave wait here
something like that wait here stay and
everyone everyone is afraid around
everyone is so afraid because stuff like
this has been happening lately and it's
really scary like there are little
shooting
movie theater shooting it's so scary
scary scary position especially when you
have kids around doing my whole family
like with me was so so scary so we're
all sitting down at the airport and then
I believe there was two people like
arguing or something like that and then
someone I don't know try to pull out
something and then everyone assumed that
that person had like a gun or something
he was like a shooter so everyone in the
airport was screaming I don't know
happen and a lot of people were running
away so when they see those people
running away
hello is a vanilla
we begin
sorry Lola
shoulder
what you doing everything's good what
you're doing
the warning is good to be much it's a
good remark
people went ran out we went out through
the emergency exit where the airplane
were like lands and takes off so I ran
out with my family at that place and it
was the scariest thing ever because
everything was happening like I didn't
know what was going on and like rhemas
there crying thinking she didn't know
what the heck was going on at one point
Reema was lost I grabbed her literally I
had to grab her by the neck and like and
run and then my brother-in-law he was
lost to us it was literally so freaking
scary everyone was crying no one knew
what was going on
no one knew anything all everyone knew
was that they thought there was a
shooter right in front of our face
because there was an argument he tried
to pull out something so everyone
thought something was going down and
everyone started running people are
falling babies were crying families it
was literally chaos I want made it even
scarier like the freaking I don't know
what it was the FBI our bomb squad or
Homeland Security you know the security
the police not remedies like the top cop
police the people who take care of like
the president they came they literally
came with like guns they everyone had to
have to keep their hands up even rima
have to keep your hands up everyone had
to keep their hands up and they have to
like check everyone take the bags throw
the bags check people's bags everyone
had to evacuate out went to come back in
but handle everything well those
Homeland Security they helped so much so
huge shout out to them they helped a lot
literally saved us they saved us so huge
who shadow to them and a huge shout-out
to you guys for all your prayers and
thoughts thank you guys so much I do not
know what's gonna happen from now on
just keep us in your prayers because my
family is literally scarred for life
like this is this was supposed to be
their first time going on airplane and
it's a horrible horrible experience
Reema
is scared for a life to step in any
plane right now
literally crying and bad to tell her
