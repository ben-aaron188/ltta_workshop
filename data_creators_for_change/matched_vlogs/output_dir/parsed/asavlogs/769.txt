lot of you guys I've seen a lot of you
guys tweeting me telling me Adam you
don't have to give an iPhone you have it
you don't have to give a MacBook having
something having something from you or
your vlogs already make us so happy make
our days
you guys are so so sweet thank you guys
since you guys are so like really too
sweet but I'm still doing that like I
have to give back at least a MacBook to
like a writer that I do me because I
don't know what MacBook will help a lot
maybe help them with like school it'll
help them with maybe if they want to
start YouTube it'll help them if they a
MacBook will help them with so most of
his crying I'm actually happiest crying
he just woke up so I can see him but I
don't know yeah Oh as I was saying a
MacBook which is what I'm choosing for
the giveaway not iPhone cuz I did iPhone
last time and shout-out to Jada who won
last time the iPhone this was her hope
you I hope the iPhone I'm helped she's
truly a ride and I do me she came she
she came to every single one of my
events in her seat which is in London
she came to every single event which I
appreciate so so much and it means the
world when I see people coming to every
single one of my events even if they
live in I do come like a lot so that
meant the world and this time I'm gonna
do a MacBook Pro the main winner will
win the MacBook Pro and ten more winners
will win I actually do this a while ago
but I'm gonna do was like not the papers
I'm gonna do with the clear paper I'm
gonna write your name I'm right I love
and your name or your at name or
whatever you owe me to write and I'm
gonna put it in a vlog so you can have I
think this is the best way instead of
sending a letter because I'm not gonna
lie last time when I had the letters one
it got really confusing some people were
DME me claiming to be like I am her
sister she says she said send it to this
address they said send it to that
address so it got really confusing the
only one that I had to take serious was
the iPhone and I send it to to the last
winner Jada and she got it and with the
letters one it got really confusing so
this time I'm gonna do I love and
whatever your name is here so hope you
guys understand what that ten winners
and the main water is the MacBook Pro
winner this is something to give back to
you guys you guys
you all do not have to participate but
if you do want to participate you can
I'm going to be choosing the winners
mainly on YouTube and Instagram and the
main thing for YouTube this is how I'm
going to choose most of the winners on
YouTube I want you all to comment on a
vlog that was one of your favorite vlogs
like a vlog that you loved so so much
leave a comment there on your favorite
vlog I'm gonna be choosing a random vlog
clicking on it I'm going to go to the
comments and I'm going to see which ones

from the giveaway and whichever random
vlog I choose and whichever random
comment I choose that person will win
I'll be choosing a lot of winners from
there I'm not going to let you guys know
which winner I'm gonna be choosing for
the MacBook Pro but it'll either be on
Instagram comments Instagram likes or
YouTube comments so it's out of those
three and if I do choose you and I see
that you're not subscribed you're not
even following me and you're just doing
it to like win then I'm not gonna choose
