just around thirty forty minutes ago
celebrating myself being twenty three
years old and I was expecting to have a
crazy happy birthday I was gonna like go
out had all these plans like work that I
was going to post crazy pictures of my
outfits but I seriously do not feel
right doing any of this so I decided to
cancel all my plans I decided to not
post any birthday pictures I didn't want
you guys tell me happy birthday because
one of my idols like Muhammad Ali is
literally like a guy that I've looked up
to ever since I was young and I still do
it
the only thing passed away I mean I know
he should be in a better place not
shallow but it's just like I feel like I
feel like I don't know I feel like
almost like a part of me I feel like
usually when celebrities like pass what
I guess I do get sad but this time when
when Muhammad Ali I feel like
my family someone so close to me
knowing that passed away like my Hartley
I had a hole in my chest and I just
didn't feel right even thinking about
almond birthday so I didn't want you
guys tell me have a birthday and I'm
here sorry for even spreading this
negative energy but I just don't feel
like celebrating something where he
passed away on that day so it won't it
is one fewer so I'm not gonna be
celebrating my bread I'm not gonna be
going out or doing any plans I canceled
everything not gonna post any pictures
out of respect for Muhammad of Muhammad
Ali and all I want you guys to do
together is to just make dua for him for
his family's close friends and that's
all I want you guys to in the comments
below you don't have to have it if you
did thank you guys so so much but you
don't really have to I want you guys
just keep mama deli in your prayers and
inshallah milligram Jenna and also I
will not be uploading the main channel
video today I wanted to upload it so bad
I have the video ready but I'm not gonna
upload it I rather wait till tomorrow
because I do not want to celebrate
nothing today and I don't want to
celebrating today so I rather celebrated
tomorrow with a new video so tomorrow

time I promise and once again I'm so so
sorry this is seriously like my worst
birthday ever one of the worst

just it's hard for me too this guy is a
freakin legend like I didn't project on
him when I was young guys always quotes
