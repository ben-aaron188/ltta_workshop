probably a little bit harder than it
looks
he's got a ping-pong gonna play beer
pong with himself oh oh my god I
remember this guy I remember watching
him eight oh no it's a pool snooker ball

thing to do

pranks but he's just all so amazing at
football and he's the kind of person
that doesn't look like he's amazing at
football you know you look him and you
do not think he's capable of those
talents

trolley scoffer that's just like looking
for your mate for a header isn't it boom
