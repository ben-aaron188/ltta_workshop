hello beautiful sexy people look at that
sexy best yeah it's not plantation
Friday
unfortunately remember when that was a
thing yeah sorry it's not thing anymore
some people want me to bring it back but
a lot of you just didn't like it so you
gotta please the masses right so today's
video is gonna be a bit advisee a bit
sit down a bit chatty I'm just gonna
chat to you guys I've got some questions
that I'm gonna answer from you about
like how to be a youtuber because did
you know a youtuber is the most
requested career in kids at school when
they want to grow up they're want to be
a youtuber that's what people are saying
so got some questions to help inspire
them just like any of you thinking about
any or any of you all are doing it and
just one want something that we
something that ok
paulina wants to know how to overcome
the hate this is a very good question
because when you first start doing
YouTube and not many people start
watching you when you first get a few
viewers everyone's usually really
positive and really nice and supportive
and you start building this really small
tight-knit community of just nice people
because they found your videos and then
they slowly grow with you and grow you
etc then you get hate comment of someone
that dislikes your video and you feel so
abused inside by that you're like why
does this person hate me what have I
done and you feel targeted you feel like
you want to ask them why you want to
chat them and it brings your whole mood
down and this was such a big thing to
overcome because you're just like why
why why they hang me and to be honest
the only advice I can say is like you
kind of have to just try and not think
that I have focused on the positive
stuff because the haters are just there
because they're lowlights they got
nothing to do they literally are just
trolling you whatever whereas if you're
caring about the real people that people
actually watch your content and care
about what they're watching and comment
and like they're the people you're gonna
get your good energy off and vibe off of
them so try and do that for the
beginning stage and then I always think
is really funny the amount of hay that
I'll get now I don't I literally don't
care about it I think because I've
become so numb to it and I just kind of
take it and make fun of that so you guys
have seen I've made videos with like
hate comments and stuff just because I
think it's funny too sometimes
go back with them about something as
long as it's not too personal
but anyone that's too personal wiring
I've blocked them cut them out Katie
wants to know essential cameras mics and
equipment now I'm probably not the best
person ask because I'm not like a camera
phonetic fanatic who's obsessed with
than you that's Alfie Alfie bye is a new
camera every time we go to the airport
no Matt where you going about what trip
how people buy a new camera or new lens
something like that for me I use a Canon
70d it's good because it has like an
autofocus you can leave almost you're
moving so it's good for that kind of
stuff microphone I use a rode mic for
stuff here I think for the the money
that it costs is one of the best things
for vlogging like in front of a camera
when we do sketch is we will use a mic
that will stick on my chest because the
sounds much better if I'm doing stuff in
the public and the camera is far away or
it's just someone's better sound quality
that way even when we do a sketch and
that's also a road mic and it's actually
cheaper than this mic up here and you
just plug it into your phone and it
records as a voice memo so you sync it
up and then you can add here that way
vlogging wise to be able to use my phone
for a lot of vlogging because it's great
easy you don't have to carry camera
around I'm not one of those people who
has like a camera bag and I'm not casey
nice tat who's got so much camera
equipment I don't know what to do with
that
I like easiness so I just have my phone
and depends on the style of your content
but a lot of people always worry about
the quality how it looks etcetera but
you've got a thing a lot of the time
it's content over quality you know like
right now this looks nice the
backgrounds blurred and so that but if
the background wasn't blood it's not
really gonna make any difference to this
video whereas if you're doing an RT vlog
and you're kind of like in the filmmaker
aspiring to be that sort of kind of
youtuber then maybe camera equipment etc
is a bigger thing for you and the types
of different things you use does make
more sense but it totally depends on
what your what you're wanting to achieve
and what kind of videos you want to make
but for a lot of the things you don't
need super high-end equipment give some
abraham how to get over the nervousness
of talking to a camera
that's actually a really big thing not
only talking like to a camera how I am
now a lot of that is vlogging in the
public you guys know with me I'm not
very good at vlogging in public on my
own yeah I'm always we get really
nervous when blogging in public I always
feel much more comfortable in I'm with
someone doesn't matter who that person
is I suddenly feel a lot more
comfortable talking like this to a
camera when I started I would do it when
I was in the house too didn't want
anyone to hear me or I'd do it when like
my mom was hoovering the house so I knew
she definitely wouldn't come in or I
could hear that Hoover stop when she was
gonna come in because there I was a
secret and I was nervous and I didn't
want to be like young talking to a
camera but I feel like now a youtuber is
such a known thing that if you're
telling your parents are oh I'm gonna
make a youtube video they'd kind of go
oh yeah like I've seen those videos
before you know how do you get more subs
by done not getting subscribers when you
start it's very very hard I kind of
found collaborating was great to begin
with and I was talking about this
earlier that I really feel like the
generation of youtubes for me didn't
really clap and it was our generation
that came up together everyone clapping
everyone hanging out and we were the
first real I want to say community from
YouTube that we were always hanging out
always in people's videos always helping
everyone whenever someone had something
cool with it or tweet it we do just
because we were all made some money to
help our mates and that helped everyone
grow but a lot of that has changed since
then you know the new YouTube is coming
up now I feel like these big daily
vlogging things that are really popular
at the moment are based around they plan
things that happen in these videos so a
lot of daily vloggers will literally not
film their day like oh I'm doing this
today I'm doing that it's more what
crazy thing can we do today cool that
will get us views we'll do that for the
title and thumbnail and then they do the
rest of the vlog around but everything
in the vlogs pretty much set up you know
that's kind of where daily vlogging
cocktails going how do you make your
voice not sound weird I don't know your
voice it I think that's to do with your
thought process and I'm saying that
because when you first hear your voice
so many people were like I hate the
sound of my own voice
that's just because how you sound
through a
speak or through something recorded is
different to how you think you sound so
when I'm talking now I think I sound
honest but how I actually sound is
slightly different and I think that's
what throws people off but that's just a
habit thing and you'll get over that
soon I don't worry about that upsides
and downsides of being youtuber upsides
there is hundreds literally I think have
the best job in the world I can manage
my own time I'm allowed to do you know
I'm essentially my own boss so I can do
what I want when I want just as long as
I get things done I get to travel a lot
from YouTube I feel especially with me
I've so many other opportunities of come
out of it like all of the crazy things
I've been able to do in the last year
it's because of YouTube and you guys can
watch my videos which is awesome and I'm
always grateful for those kinds of
things some of the downsides I would say
is that you have to be or you you don't
have to be but you feel like a
commitment to share your personal life
and that's just me speaking like I daily
vlog for two years it's like you let
this you let people in on your life and
then when things happen you feel like
you have to share what happens with your
audience and that's a bit of a weird
thing I feel like now I would just be a
bit more private but like I don't know
that's the thing it's like some
youtubers a daily vlog chefs so much
information about their private life and
it's just really hard that when you want
to step back and have a bit of privacy
it's really hard once you've put a lot
of things out there so that's another
thing I'd say it's just sometimes think
about what you're actually putting on
the internet because it will be there
forever here's a question how long does
it take to get the perfect thumbnail now
for these videos I'll show you I'll do
the process now so I finished the video
so why not throw more Marcus I'll be
like well there we go thank you so much
for watching I hope has been insightful
to you guys maybe this can be a series
so if you enjoy it let me know maybe
leave your questions down there but I
would love to know if you'd like more of
this or you just want me to shut up and
never talk about it again let me know
and then I would say and I'll see you
guys tomorrow in our video subscribe if
you're new
by that's how the video ends as soon as
that finishes I turn autofocus on my
camera on now I'm in thumbnail mode so I
will get a bit closer to the camera and
what I try to think with each video is
what is the thumb now going to be in my
head and it's tried to vision you know
is there going to be a picture here is
there gonna be a picture there is there
gonna be picture like am I should I be
in the middle so sometimes do a
variation of things so I might come here
no because it's like YouTube I might do
thinking face so if you have deep in
thought that I might move here and be a
bit closer like because might put
something there might put your questions
there so it's like now I'd say I've got
the thumbnail shot and I'm going to
actually finish the video so yeah see
you guys tomorrow
Hey
