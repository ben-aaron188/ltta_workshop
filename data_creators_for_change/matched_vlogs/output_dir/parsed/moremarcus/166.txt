hello beautiful sexy people I'm very
very very very very excited to this
video because and sorry I've got things
going on all over the shop the other day
I was looking for a microphone and I
found the microphone but what I found
I've got a box of like old stuff that
I've kept upstairs and one in my office
and I have collected I've got a
collection of those like iPods through
the generations and I just want to share
them with you I want to show you them
and then maybe listen to like some of
the music on them and just see what I
was listening to at those times and also
just a reflection on how technology has
changed so yeah I don't really know how
the videos gonna go but just bear with
it so starting off of this bad boy boom
a scare and this old classic this is the
third generation iPod and yeah I've got
it unfortunately my one doesn't actually
work so I can't get it turned on no
matter how much I've charged it so yeah
like I said I'll just show you the
lyrics were sick from there I've got the
first I think the first ever iPod mini I
think this is called iPod mini that that
was called a mini when you actually
think of the size it is there we go that
is classified as an iPod mini back in
the day you guys as any of you even
remember these from that I don't know
what generation this is we've got this
iPod it's not on touch screen yet it's
got a spinning wheel still quite thick
and then from there I have first iPod
touch the first-ever iPod touch I've got
which will go into this one on going to
the music and stuff so I think it's
pretty cool actually a watermark online
which you'll see and then the other two
which I don't really this is not that
old this is a new iPod mini or an iPod
Nano yeah a lot of you probably have
that or notor
and then and like a about I don't know
