smell feel so awkward vlogging for so
long on phone this big the public is
everyone going to see one do it but
behind me on the screen whereas if you
got Cameron already said yeah saying how
distinctive the smell of Subway is just
like staring and why just walk around
walking around this street like this
filming people's looking into the camera
is my favorite then hey I was trying to
say somebody has a really distinctive
smell and you can smell it from miles
away got out eventually there's
obviously lots of people around that
promote things so I'm sort of filming
around and face people
