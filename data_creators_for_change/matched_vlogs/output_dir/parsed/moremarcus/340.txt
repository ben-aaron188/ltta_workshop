5:20 a.m. you may be thinking it looks
like the evening because of how phantom

the day I'm going tonight weird today
I'm saying tonight and I'll be there
tomorrow I'm going to watch the Grand
Prix and also do some really cool stuff

going there L'Oreal and I don't really
know what to expect
it's just gonna be like a bit of a fun
trip and I'm filming a blurs Hamilton
got these cool shoes actually from Kurt
Geiger
they're like quite cool then I'm wearing
black chinos rode them up a bit I've
gone for a standard sort of just white
shirt with a blazer and I've rode the
sleeves up because Monaco it's probably
gonna be hot so this is my look for
today I'm also packed all the stuff in
here I've got some like party thing
tonight blows all around and stuff so
I'm really like this trip don't want to
expect but I think it's made a lot of
fun I don't know about so much energy at
5:20 am i reaching up this much energy
this is not the weather you expect when
you land in the South of France not just
a little bit of rain it's full-on storm
you know you work at L'Oreal when your
hair's this color I've been given my
very own waterproof bag with my name on
and some things inside which I look
forward to opening so this is some of
the crew that we're going with one of
the guys Robin Robin that's less shirt
let's show the shoes
so we've noticed that we've basically
got the exact same shoes on so here's
mine and his Robins Robin does fashion
so I don't do fashion so I'm just
assuming I've done a good job on that
from that correct really good job we're
really on trend
that
but if you're gonna look how incredible
the clouds over there
there was Oh two storms here earlier and
it's left these weird clouds floating
just on that hill looks amazing here we
go baby this is so mental
yeah

helicopter flies in and has to land

look
this is so cool because I've been to
South France twice in the last two weeks
when to can't can film you guys saw it -

France so for some reason agent thought
would be a good idea to skip the lift
and do some extra legs and go down 14
stories of stairs not only is it a long
way but I'm getting very dizzy
as an attorney I work with so many
people
oh we know where to go as from this one
person she must have a flip in a key arm
she's been holding that out for ten
minutes
she's now switched to the right arm not
dedicated enough but it's a good old
workout on the older Trapster

all the time that'll be amazing
