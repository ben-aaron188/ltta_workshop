Oh fest is back on we're in fan picture
mode what happened last time
bassy courtney the teacher women just
absolutely got rattled that they were
seeing each other
seem to know everything and gave them a
load of shit and now they're not allowed
to do that anymore
this week sucked missed the comfort
Marcus I missed his voice I missed his
eyes his smile his mind ideas trains I
missed everything about him he was so
much more to me than just a guy he was
the guy he was my guy and I love him oh
my days she needs to not get attached so
quickly other than Marcus being out of
my life nothing big happened I talked to
patients dr. Lewis Lindsay the
receptionist I isolated myself from
everything honestly I hated this
I'm leaving London in less than a week
since there's only a few days left here
doctor it does jump around quite a lot
but I've got a week that's a few days
decided to have a conversation with me
Allie you're one of the greatest interns
I've ever had the pleasure of meeting
but I've noticed that you've been a bit
more distant maybe I stayed silent is it
about a relationship she asked of a
certain patient fuck me
these people should be fortune tellers
they're in the wrong line of work here I
knot it again slowly maybe one that left
recently what guess who at that point I
looked directly into her eyes I take
your worrisome look as a yes she said so
how long have you and Marx been seeing
each other well we moreso saw each other
we weren't going out anymore
why not Allie can I tell you something I
met my husband while I was in your
position he was a patient I was a doctor
soon enough we were secretly dating
casually but he still had to be a secret
for obvious reasons eventually we didn't
want to hide it anymore he stopped
therapy sessions and we continued on
with our relationship publicly I know I
in the public eye she's not a celebrity
he was no longer my patient and nobody
truly cared about who I was in a
relationship with it was my life no one
questioned you only the people who
disliked me she replied she got haters
thank you at least some advice that
seems cheesy but it's one of the truest
things I found out you can't help who
you fall in love with and that will
remain true until the very end of time
so what are you saying there must be
some point to this lesson Oh course
there is she's saying go and bang Marcus
and it's fine I'm not saying anything
specific except for the fact that you
and Marcus would be a good pair
I could see it since the beginning the
look between you two it was adorable
usually people never get to witness true
love at first sight but I saw so I think
that you shouldn't end it not yet
thank you dr. Lewis Amy call me Amy
don't forget about why I said I know but
but what it's too late honey
it's never no I'm afraid it is I was
playing with Marcus's heart I caused him
enough pain think he cause you more pain
in the car crash if that's how you feel
that's how you feel I can't change that
so when is your flight proper deep and
then leaves you not like a break is like
I can't change that so when is your
flight
have a nice flight thanks again for
everything drew came to my hotel to keep
me company and how before I leave in the
morning so you excited to go back to
America yeah I guess I think I'll kind
of miss it here though yeah because
you're abandoning me oh don't say that
true you'll make me cry I cry before I
came actually I can't comprehend that
you're actually leaving me no way I
cried on the train right here whoa bro
we have so much in common we actually
might be related
I really will miss you drew okay okay
don't get all sappy on me here oh but I
can't help it
hey stop it now and then I hugged him he
hugs me back squeeze me tight for moment
and then we released each other I'm
going to miss my friends here dr. Lewis
and Lindsay everything and one other
thing my companion my love my dream
Marcus well this is it it's the end I
was waiting and what better thing to do
when waiting in an airport you guessed
it people watch one last look before I
boarded a pair of big beautiful eyes
looked at me could it be him as I stood
there shocked recognition overcame me as
he rushed over to me without a word
embracing me in a big bed like hope he
must be get on this plane because you
can't get to a plane boarding unless
you're getting all of that yeah oh I
don't want you to leave
dr. Lewis called me she told me what you
guys talked about and quite frankly I
think that could be us all people
boarding flight C six flying directly
from London to Boston please board now
thank you
mark has looked at me with pleading eyes
I Lou please I'm begging of you of me -
what Marcus stay here I want to but I
can't
no I meant be with me I stared straight
into his eyes and leap even close it
into Marcus his arms and kissed him with
passion and lust while I was wrapping
around his neck go and text me when you
arrive in Boston I need to know if my
girlfriend made it home safely
that's so cringe I smiled brightly at
him kissing him one last time before I
left and went on my plane staring out on
my window at the airport looking at the
tool bill figure in the building waving
knowing that was for me I'm sorry
one he's not there because he hasn't
he's not flying anymore - as if you're
gonna be you're gonna be on a window
seat anyway three as if you happen to be
on a window facing the right direction
you're gonna be anywhere near the window
that he's standing at
brilliant
right homeless long so I read and slept
though it was hard not to focus on marks
in our relationship I came in to the
airport with my bags noticing my family
within an instant I come over smiling
big we hug and then my mother says and
someone else came to see you
I look to her confused she pointed and I
turn around half expecting to see Marcus
for the sake of an adorable fairytale
ending but instead I saw someone
different it was brendan standing there
smiling expecting me to leap into his
arms or something of that nature have a
declaration of love and forgiveness he
was the one thing I least expected and
the one thing I would rather have left
behind
shit's getting serious now yeah that's
gonna sum up this fanfiction and then it
right on a cliffhanger what marks is
gonna be proper pissed off when he finds
out about that he's gonna be livid I
hope you guys enjoy this series give the
video a thumbs up if you are and I'll
see you next time with another
fanfiction special bye
