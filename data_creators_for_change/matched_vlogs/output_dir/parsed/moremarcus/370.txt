absolutely boiling in my house today I'm
taking part in a quiz and that quiz is
what year did these youtubers post their
first video all that fangirling is
finally paid off I watch a lot of
YouTube so I'm hoping I'm going to be
quite good at it oh look who's little
faces it's this is quite a new quiz

at me out happy I am that was a premier
somewhere Marcus Butler mashup I got
this one wrong 2010 boom it would be a
bit embarrassing Shane oh my god Shane's

he 2007 fuck sake that's really pissed
me off because I'm a big shame fan dan

oh definitely 2009 because I flew it was
earlier than that it's a hundred percent

been on YouTube a long long shot I think
Tyler's like 2006 I think I'm going
dozen 6mon dembow are mine I need to
think that it's a little bit more Troy

first-ever videos of him singing like to
YouTube years before that unknown 2008

like he started posting the same time as
me and his channels massive like how
insane is that that he hasn't even been
going that long and he's so far ahead

got isn't hey he was literally the god
of YouTube especially was beard right

PewDiePie beard Jeff I could pull that

than that hey there we go look at that
coin I checked nigahiga is Wikipedia and
he posted his first video in 2006 this
says he made his first video in 2007 see
