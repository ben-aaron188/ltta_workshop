today wondering is another try not to
cry now I did one of these before
what was the videos like that animation
and I got like a little bit emotional I
didn't tear didn't leave my eye by the
ghetto bit sad so this time we're gonna
see if we can actually make insensitive
markers cry like I said before I'm
actually a very very sensitive person
I just don't show that so yeah if I cry
no this is the saddest commercial you're
ever see well my boys like strangling
myself though yeah that's what I need
all right here we go saddest commercial
that's three minutes we have no party
tyranny I want a better father
Oh Paul Tim someone who is not a deaf
mean it's very nice deaf dumb dad you
know her out go go my dad like everyone
else's
this is making me sad all right
obviously in recent twists but because
her dad's death she sounds like she
doesn't like him at my mum party they
you follow you can listen to my hopes
and fears deep hi father who speaks you

mean it's a bit harsh if she did that
just because I dance deaf like Monty
