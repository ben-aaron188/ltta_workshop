hello beautiful sexy people welcome to
welcome to a con enjoy the video what am
i doing welcome to a exposing video or
reviewing video I don't know if they're
gonna be exposed because I haven't
watched them yet so I have an opinion on
them but we've a little lab next week on
sweets day what the hell is wrong with
me Paranormal Activity is like this huge
thing on YouTube actually tweeted the
other day how it's so interesting how
loads of youtubers just all of a sudden
happened to be experiencing paranormal
activity like wow and yeah we've done an
exposing video before where people go
through the house and show things etc
but today is gonna be a Ouija board
specific people start doing Ouija board
so we're gonna have a look at those
videos and basically decide whether
they're real or not
cool cool let's have a little look shall
we jumping into the first Ouija board in
haunted house evil demon reached
apparently all right guys the time has
come we got a fat group of people with
us today all right it's mister town of
Fox here we go here we are back at the
abandoned house to play the a Ouija
board going to abandon place is pretty
cool I went to an abandoned town once in
Germany and it was so creepy and scary
but so interesting at the same time so
that alone is pretty scary if you're
gonna do that
okay so just don't take your fingers off
it and let me say goodbye because like
the only rules I've learned from this if
you're unaware of what a Ouija board is
I have never played one myself
but it is a board as we can see here and
something goes sits on top of it like a
glass cup or something and everyone sits
around table puts their finger on this
thing and asks the room questions and if
there's an evil spirit there the spirit
moves your fingers across onto those
letters in it that is talking to you so
you put the letters together you have
words get it cool are there any spirits
out there that would like to contact us
yes or no right moving really z SS Z I'm
sorry I do not I'm not taking this at
all at all like Wyatt first of all why
both their hands raised off the table so
you got the table like this both of
their arms are like raised up so they
can easily move it why can't you just
rest your elbow there and put your
finger on it and if it moves it will
just do that itself rather than both
having to all you need that room to kind
of cock it back and forth are you an
evil spirit
look at the way is moving oh my god this
is so obviously just being pushed and
pulled come on is this your house is
this your house
all right did you see that did you guys
just see that
mental tell me this why doesn't a Ouija
board work where nobody's touching it
and you just ask the thing questions and
then it moves with no one touching it
like come on
are you still there just go in the
background so bored as well okay why are
you an evil spirit key I'm sorry
is anyone believing this is anyone
believing this I'm not believing this
for he's like making no sense it's like
being really weird a car I just I think
it's me being a bit skeptical because
there is no way that is being moved by
an evil spirit like it's just not is it
like I said why why does it not work if
there no one is touching it I've learned
it but the OBG board likes beards make
girls more to it they can even get girls
more okay so apparently they like girls
more spirits according to Tana who would
know something strange can you tell us
how you died
I mean that first move that she's
definitely not pulling that issue I did
watch her hand
do you not like any of us here
who don't you like Oh having just flying
off there been there who don't you like
are you a boy are you a boy
are you a girl
no sir boy no sir I'm sorry can we just
watch that what what is going on there
fingers slip and then it pulls look I
don't know like I said I'm just a bit
skeptical when it comes to these things
so I would love to know what you guys
think as well but we're gonna look at
another video so I'm Jay Station Zozo
breaking all the rules of the Ouija
board in a cemetery 3m challenged Ouija
board Oh gone wrong also whoever
invented the Ouija board people
obviously buying isn't it's just like a
massive marketing I mean they'll
probably loving all of these videos
because so many kids in your they were
gonna break all of the rules of a Ouija
board on purpose to try to get something
to happen guys I'm trying to prove to
the non-believers that this stuff
actually works prove it to me I'm a
non-believer come on break those rules
and one of the rules is to never do the
Ouija board in the cemetery so we're
pulling up on the cemetery right now
guys I mean that is pretty creepy going
to a cemetery at 3:00 a.m. oh and uh
honestly guys like everything is real
like I'm believing Lance Stewart when
he's telling you it's real like I do the
same thing and the same thing is
happening to me all you believe in lost
you when he's possessed but let's just
insert like that is the big question so
are you also believing that because I'm
not so take a minute right now just drop
a big like on this video guys you
already know it's gonna be late
that's theirs likes but yeah I just want
to say right now that we respect
everybody's grave that's here anybody
who's buried here we fully respect do
you we fully respect your grave but we
are gonna sit on top of a few dead
people and do we do both for views but
we very respect it
we're just gonna break like all the
rules of the games so we're gonna
disrespect the spirits that's one of the
rules never disrespect the spirits so
we're definitely gonna do that try to
entice them to do something to us well
that is a good way to go values if you
but if you're a believer of this right
which I don't think I am of the Ouija
board and you got a fully believe in
demons and like you don't mess with that
shit but if you believe in that you
don't then go and break all these rules
and yeah abuse those demons so me and
Salvador are gonna play together because
he's not a believer but at the very end
I'm gonna play alone so we're just gonna
break every single rule of the Ouija
board oh risky and hopefully we can
officially say that this is actually
real guys what the thing is I want to
believe this all right so are you
friendly all right it's moving guys I
swear bro I'm not moving this cello I
swear to God bro he is purling that it's
not friendly oh yeah guys like we
already know this is not good so next
question are you haunting me okay we
already know this isn't good
let's just carry on though to make sure
we get some some great content so I'm
gonna spit on the Ouija board okay guys
