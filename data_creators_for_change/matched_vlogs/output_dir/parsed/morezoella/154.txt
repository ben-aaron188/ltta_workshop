oh there we go
so my little makeup doing session doing
makeup me doing my makeup stop because
Maddie arrived so I just turned it off
but I am totally rapping Tania by beauty
today I've got this eyeshadow palette on
which is birthday suit and I also have
the matte lip on which is Martha mu look
how beautiful this color is I love it I
felt like it looks slightly different on
me than it does on Tom I don't know
anyway I have meetings this morning I'm
doing that thing where my hair really
needs a wash but I'm going to pretend
that it's absolutely fine
and I will just try and disguise the
grease with dry shampoo it's fine
right I'm gonna take my laptop
downstairs and I need to have breakfast
I think I might make a smoothie also
look I tidied my makeup thingy yesterday
and now look like it just becomes a mess
so easily oh well I hope you're all
having a wonderful day so far I am
although I woke up with a headache so
I'm gonna go and take a tablet because I
hate that I like downed a bottle of
water as well but that didn't work so I
think I pulled something in my neck in
the night and now I've got headaches I
could really do with a massage hint hint
Alfie deyes okay I'm gonna try and do a
cinnamon roll smoothie which is bananas
cinnamon oats almond milk a bit of
vanilla and some honey and some brown
sugar and it's supposed to have yogurt
in it but I don't have any yogurt so
we're doing it without you're good and
with a bit of honey instead
I'm not sure about this because it's got
no light well I mean it it's got almond
milk with been in the fridge but it's
actually warm sugar yeah it's really
sugary it's very sweet and I don't think
I'm good I mean very sweet it's quite
sweet no it's good I think if it was
cold I would actually love that because
I like quite sweet I think I would
recommend ice maybe I shouldn't have put
honey in maybe you should put either
sugar or honey or not both yeah and I
think a bit more cinnamon yeah a smidgen
more anyway experimental smoothie
session done meeting is done
that was a long old meeting it's now
half past one I feel really bad because
on days like this I don't feel like the
vlogs are gonna be much fun but I told
myself I would film or even if my days
won necessarily is fun and kind of
carefree as you or I might like them to
be because there are gonna be days when
I have to do meetings and as much as
meetings take up a lot of time and
they're not so great or entertaining for
you
guys to watch they have to happen
whether I like it or not because
otherwise things don't get done so if
you haven't noticed already meetings
happen pretty regularly and that is a
huge huge part of my life so I am going
to document it even though it's not so
fun but it's also really great for me to
look back on because sometimes I can be
like when did I have that meeting or I
don't remember or when was that and
actually I remember because I've logged
it or I've logged the day I can't
actually block my meetings that would be
slightly awkward that would be weird it
would be like you were included in all
the meetings am I allowed to say that
I'm probably not allowed to say that it
was a very exciting meeting I am gonna
now edit my vlog I feel like I've edited
most of it already and my camera battery
is flashing so I need to be quick
Harry Potter is on I never heard the
other day off he was like you watched
this at least like twice a week and I
was like don't over exaggerate but
because I've not got into watching it
and it's always on sky it's just a great
bit of background noise are any of you
similar to me in a sense that I can't do
work in silence I just can't do it I
have to have something on in the
background I feel like a creative mind
never like silence is that a quote I
don't know my creative mind doesn't like
silence I much prefer with a bit of
noise in the background or something
happening behind behind me or around me
even when I read I kind of like to have
music on or a film on even though I
can't really pay full attention to it
it's quite comforting to know that
there's some something else going on so
yeah let me know if you're similar to me
in that aspect I always used to listen
to tapes before going to bed when I was
younger as well because silence before
going to sleep is not fun I'm not sure
how I just got onto that ramble sorry
can we just take a moment look at this
dog look at you you can't see ears
why are you doing that you're trying to
make them love you because you know the
cameras on you you're trying to be all
cute you try to be hunky I wish you
could see well I could see right now
look at this dog why are you so funny
doggy you know some very strong believer
that negativity breeds negativity if you
surround yourself with negativity you
become a negative person which is why I
think for me over the years I have
really focused on the positive I
surround myself with positive people
positive influences I am inspired by
positive people and I want whatever I
put out into the world to have a
positive effect on other people who also
might need that I guess this is
something that I think about quite
regularly because it's a huge huge part
of what I do and it's also a question
that gets brought up a lot whenever I do
interviews with people whenever I meet
someone whenever someone else is
interested in becoming a youtuber or
doing something online one of the main
questions I get asked about is how do
you deal with hate and it actually makes
me quite sad to say I feel like I've
actually grown a really thick skin over
the past two years definitely and I've
kind of got used to it there really is
nothing anyone could say to me that
would affect me anymore in the way that
it has previously that's not to say that
things people say don't still affect me
in some way because some days I'll be
having a real
happy day and someone might say
something that really kind of sticks
with me but I feel like over the years
I've really learnt how to listen to
something negative read something
negative hold on to it for a couple of
seconds think about it process it and
drop it and that is so hard I have so
many friends that also do this online
and it makes me so sad in my heart to
watch them struggling with this I almost
find it harder to watch it happen to
someone else that's just the sort of
person I am it just makes me so sad
because I know those people really well
and even though you guys know a lot
about me you know a lot about my friends
you know a lot about your favorite
youtuber you don't know everything you
don't know them like their family you
don't know them like their close friends
and really even their friends and family
don't know them to the extent that they
really know themselves and it's it's
hard because when you see how hate
affects people differently and it does
no two people will react the same way to
anything and I think a lot of people
forget that you know just because
someone might have a really large
following doesn't automatically entitle
somebody to have this opinion of them
like I totally get that
youtubers put their lives out there but
there isn't this automatic rule that
once you're a youtuber you've given up
every right to not be criticized to not
be hated on to not be stalked to not be
trolled like that right does not
automatically get taken away from you
that's not like a rule that comes with
YouTube it's a rule that I think a lot
of people justify with themselves to
make themselves feel better about being
mean the fact that someone has 5 million
subscribers 10 million subscribers
hundred thousand subscribers twenty
subscribers makes no difference on how
you should treat them they are still
human being every single person you meet
in the street whether they look like
they've got their lives together or not
have demons they have things that they
are struggling with on a day to day
basis whether they choose to share that
online or whether they choose to keep
that to themselves because that's the
best way they can deal with it
you don't know you really don't know you
have to treat every single person with
respect and you need to treat people
like people it's it just it baffles me
how some people just think that it's
okay to be a certain way towards someone
because they have a following because
they share their lives online it's not a
right that gets taken away from someone
it's not your choice to decide whether
or not you can say something like that
oh but it's fine because they've got
this many subscribers so they're open
for criticism if someone asks for your
criticism give it kindly you don't have
to be a mean person if someone doesn't
ask for your criticism respect that to
be able to film your life and put videos
online is a life adjustment there are so
many things that people have to learn
and deal with on YouTube and I just feel
like having watched so many of my
friends dealing with certain aspects of
online negativity makes me sad that it's
still a thing and that people still
think that it's okay to treat other
human beings who they really don't know
the ins and outs of you don't know their
past you don't know the things they
might be dealing with that they might
not be sharing have some compassion I
have completely come to terms with
haters and trolls and like I said
there's really not a lot you can say to
me that will affect me in the same way
that it might have done two three even
six years ago
but it's sad that it still happens you
know it's it's sad that there are still
people out there that enjoy that like
it's entertainment for them those people
aren't happy and that that to genuinely
makes me sad because I just wish I could
do something to make their lives better
because these people aren't happy and
you need to remember that you need to as
much as I think trolls need to say
trolls but it's not always trolls as
much as I think some people need to
remember that people with the following
celebrities anyone who has decided to
give a little part of their lives to
others to make others smile they need to
remember that we're humans but we also
need to remember that these people are
human too they have issues too and they
may not be going about it in the right
way but for them that's all they can
think to do you know I don't know I've
just been thinking a lot about it and it
just it genuinely makes me sad that sad
people are making other people who
weren't sad sad and that's a lot of
negativity in a world that's already
very negative I think for any of you
that are struggling at the moment with
online hate or even real life hate you
know bullying is a thing whether it's
online or offline you have to remember
that these people don't genuinely know
you at your core they just don't and you
can't waste too much of your emotion on
these negative people because it's not
worth it I used to get so affected by it
and then I would get really annoyed at
myself that I've let a stranger who
doesn't know me who is judging me who is
angry and upset at the world I've let
them inflict negativity upon me and and
it's not really worth it because those
people aren't worth my emotions you know
I don't know I just hate seeing how it
affects people and I've had multiple
friends who I've had to watch get so
affected by this but still carry on
uploading videos still carry on we
at the end of the day it's the people
that are so positive the people that
take away something from youtubers and
bloggers or any other social media
people or celebrities there are people
that take things away from you that make
their lives better and you just have to
remember that there are so many people
out there who will watch your videos
read your blog posts read your books
read they they invest so much of their
time in you for the positive and you
have to remember those people whose
lives you're affecting for the better
you can't focus on the negative
you just can't and although it feels
like sometimes there's no light at the
end of the tunnel and there's no way
you're gonna ever be able to do it again
I once got to a point where I thought I
can't do this I enjoyed making YouTube
videos and I love making people happy
but this is intense you know not nothing
in life can set you up for stuff like
that nothing and it's sad that the only
way I can really see past it is because
I feel like I've read everything I could
possibly read you know it's like I've
become immune to it almost and I just
don't know if that's a good thing or not
I don't know there's that saying that
some if you paint an entire wall and you
get one bit wrong like you you've
painted this beautiful wall and you and
you've got a little chip of paint in the
middle every time you walk past that
wall you'll see the chip of paint and
know that that wall is not perfect and I
feel that's what happens with negativity
is there's that one little bit that can
reroute the rest of the amazingness
that's around it and it is really really
hard it is hard but I commend those of
you that receive online hate and go
through the negativity but still
continue to do what you love
for the people who love what you do and
I just feel like it's 2016 now like can
we not make this the year of positivity
if you don't agree with something that
someone's saying well you don't agree
with someone's lifestyle or you don't
agree with something that's okay like
that's at
fine there are things I don't agree with
all the time the only difference is that
I don't surround myself with that if I
don't like something I don't have time
for that you know I just wish everyone
felt that way but it's just not simple
as that
anyway where's Alfie oh my block
was supposed to go live nine minutes ago
