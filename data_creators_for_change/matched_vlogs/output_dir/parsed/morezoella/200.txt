hello everybody and welcome to vlogmas
day 3 oh my god it's already day 3
so this morning I am well firstly I did
not do a very good job of taking off my
eye makeup last night I was pretty much
falling asleep and I just got my like
cotton wool pad with my eye makeup
remover as well so that's not good um
this morning I am going to make myself
some breakfast I really really want some
yogurt yogurt does anyone actually call
it that yogurt wants me yogurt yogurt I
like me some yogurt I'm gonna use this
yogurt Oh
apple juice yes then I think a banana
and I also bought some apple and melon
not melon mango I don't like melon
everything that's all I want just a bit
of fruit have no berries which is most
unlike me because I love berry fruit
only have kind of yellow fruit and some
honey
mmm-hmm where is all the honey at sighs
my tea collection is just getting
ridiculous
look at this companies keep sending me
tea because they know how much I like
tea but like it goes on back there as
well and then this is the hot chocolate
collection but where is my honey all my
mom bought me like the fudge that's nice
I just feel like we might have too much
in these cupboards to be honest with you
right I don't know where the honey is
and I need a week and for some reason
that's making me need a weave and more
as the father I don't know how it is
because I can't quickly grab it
maybe it's in here actually mom I know
more like the spices draw I found the
honey and in doing so also realize that
I have three maple syrups in the
cupboard no one needs that much maple
syrup critic right let's make this
there we go lots of fruit and there's
yogurt and honey underneath and my fresh
glass of apple juice I'm gonna go and
eat this now and watch some other
people's vlog mice's before I have to
start the day still haven't done my
makeup yet but I've had a meeting this
morning and now Kerry's here and we're
trying to get basically I want to do a
little photo shoot with Nala with all
her cute Christmas outfits
so we've set up a little pet a pet
pedestal a pet studio where we're going
to attempt to take some photos these are
the outfits that I've picked so we've
got some Christmasy outfits I just felt
like I've got so many Christmassy
outfits and I want to see her wearing
them let's be honest so I thought this
would be a nice little thing to put on
the blog and you guys all love to see
Nala and had different festive outfits
so we're going to attempt to do this are
you ready I feel like this is just gonna
be I mean they do say never work with
children animals we're gonna have we're
gonna have somebody on the clicker and
someone on the dog with food right you
ready Missy are you ready you're gonna
get some treats if you're good well
she's being obedient at least and
inquisitive okay which one should we go
for first yeah let's do the Christmas
let's do the Christmas pudding first
look at outfit number one aren't you so
cute oh you gonna go back up good girl
sit we've got this down look at her Oh
Oh bless you
she's like please I'm doing all the
things I'm doing all the things for all
the treats outfit number two which is an
elf outfit that I absolutely love gone
and all that remained was the Hat oh
excuse me
I actually think this might be one of my
favorite outfits that she's got it's a
little elf one last year she did have
the same outfit but it was really tiny
and a viewer bought this one for her and
it was really big and I thought I'm
gonna save that because I bet you next
year we get hurt when the one she was
wearing last year I knew wouldn't fit
her forever so I kept it I'm so glad I
did because it's so cute wait look at
Carrie you go way - oh good girl are you
so professional
you're hired look at the photos see
Carrie specializes in dog photography
because she has two dogs she's just
happy when there's tree I mean at least
this is really good for her training

ugh on the Grinch oh that's why she's
excited

Christmas Co yeah we should put her in
the Christmas coat tree to get a
Christmas coat
hmm yes show them your last outfit she's
looking for treats because we dropped a
man treats on the floor I'll look
because I said show them your last
outfit she jumped up on here are you so
good guys look how cool this is this
arrived in the post for me this morning
and it's a book by Raymond Briggs called
notes from the sofa from the beloved
best-selling author of the Snowman and
other children's classics comes the
first new book in a decade old age is
another country I was just like that's
so cool I absolutely love Raymond Briggs
I love all his stories although most of
them are quite sad Raymond just gonna
throw that out there I used to listen to
them all on tape when I was younger
let's see is a beautifully illustrated
compilation of reflections on life and
what it means to get older
Raymond Briggs dips into his past to
remind us of scrumping apple's national
service party lines on telephones the
torment of cinema organs and the endless
obsession with laxatives but also gives
us warm and memorable sketches of his
life now as he enters his ninth decade
oh this is so sweet and look this is
what I saw earlier I was like oh my
goodness it's signed by him I just think
that's so cool because he's just amazing
so yeah how lovely is that came from the
place of my books get published and
printed so thank you so much I'm
actually really excited to read this I
think it will be really good I also
think my grandparents would really enjoy
this and maybe even my parents although
I feel like it's the sort of thing that
if you give to a parent they might be
like what are you suggesting
but yeah
just thought that was worth showing you
guys because I thought it was really
cool and we managed to get some really
cute shots of her she was being the
perfect model and then she went off and
had a little sleep if you're wondering
why I have this on it's because I'm so
cold I don't know why it's gone so cold
in my house it just feels really cold in
here today so I've put on my little
Christmas slippers and I've put my
dressing gown on because I can't cope
with the cold I'm also so spotty I knew
this would happen I've been like spot
free for like a month and then the
minute I start blog verse it's like boom
and it's all around my mouth I feel
really quite self-conscious about it
which I don't normally with spots I'm
kind of like oh it's a spot everyone
gets spots it doesn't matter but for
some rumor I just feel really
self-conscious about it being around my
mouth not self-conscious enough that I
wouldn't just vlog because I mean let's
be honest it's just a spot but it is
like a little bit kind of a fool I'm
just making myself some lunch
and I've just edited yesterday's vlog I
talk too much guys I was like how is
this vlog so long again I didn't do
anything yesterday but it's because I
just talk so much I'm such a Rambler
which you obviously all know anyway but
my goodness I need to shut up sometimes
look at this puppy
is it hard work being a model are you so
worn out now she's so cute
this pen was honestly like the best
thing we've ever bought she absolutely
loves it she never goes into her crate
anymore
I mean she's got she's got enough
selection of beds there but she actually
just chooses to go in and just be in
there so if any of you have a small dog
or I mean if you have a slightly bigger
dog you can get bigger pens but we use
this when we go out so we can put her
water in there we can put a bed in there
we could put a couple of toys in there
and I think I genuinely think she just
loves it like it's like her little
bedroom so yeah I'm so happy I got that
and it also just means that if we're
doing things around the house and we
just want her to be somewhere safe that
we know she's not going to cause any
trouble or get herself into any messes
then we can put her in there and she's
really happy to just be in there so
massive thumbs up for the pen I found
this little like Polaroid of me and
Alfie on Christmas morning 2013 look at
us look at Elvis Presley behind me as
well on the stocking Alfie looks so
different I honestly think I look the
exact same but I think Alfie looks
really different
I don't ever keep those pajamas kind of
annoyed it myself
we all had matching PJ's which is a
tradition that we will be keeping up
this year but how cute is that
so cute we should take another one this
year and compare them see how much we've
changed oh Christmas tree oh Christmas
tree
I'm just obsessed with the Christmas
tree I just think it looks so pretty I
can't stop filming it sorry guys I've
just put my day three of 24 days of
zoella live which is a Christmas haul we
all knew there was gonna be one of those
because I love holes I love shopping and
I love Christmas so it was bound to
happen at some point I will leave a link
to it in the description box of this
video now what I want to do actually is
open these Beauty advent calendars
otherwise I'm never going to get around
to doing it and I really really want to
because they look amazing but if it ever
kind of chilled at home video today I'm
basically trying to do as much editing
and blog post writing and just kind of
tying bits up really that I can now
before before Christmas before December
starts getting a lot busier so that's
what I've been doing today pretty much
it's not gonna be like this every day
although to be fair I actually really
enjoy watching people's vlogs where
they're just chilling at home but in the
meantime I actually know I can't get
over how Christmassy my house is it's
ridiculous I need to do I need to put
the new bedding on the sheets that's not
quite dry oh I hate that when
something's not quite right I've put my
other one in the oh look at that
one minute remaining or great timing
I've cut my actual bed sheet in the
tumble dryer so hopefully that is nice
and dry oh this is a great angle great
angle right we wait don't wait wait good
girl good girl
wait good girl and bigger good girl oh
we have to do that because has to learn
malice but also if she's around other
dogs while they're eating etc etc she I
don't know she just has to learn that
she can only when we say so
much like me and apathy I think and only
when I think I'm joking I do think this
is now done though because it just
played a little tune yes
this looks hot holy mackerel
let's put all this on the bed and make
my bed perfect and cozy look there's
honestly nothing better than getting
into a bed that's I've got fresh sheets
on it so let's do Oh wrong one there we
go
Oh No mmm what am i doing okay clearly
the lights don't work that's fine all
right I should be going to bed as soon

the lights go off I feel like I should
be going to bed but what am I doing with

of just think oh he'll be back in a
couple of days and I've got lots of
things I need to do anyway and it just
kind of goes really quickly like I'm
quite good at not being
lonely but I actually do feel a little
bit lonely oh well not long till he's

fair he's only gonna be a distraction I
hope you've enjoyed today's video give
