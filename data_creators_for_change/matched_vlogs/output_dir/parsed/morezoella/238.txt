good morning everybody I am starting
this vlog back in Wiltshire I've come on
a little walk with Nala and daddy sugg
in his little walking shoes
he put on some really posh boots and I
was like are you really gonna go on a
walk with those on he was like no um so
yeah this is the first time Nyla's
walked around here
I think she's enjoying it she'd never
smelt horse poo before and where I used
to live there's a lot of horses is
actually a riding school very close by
so there's always horses and every time
we go past a horse poo in the road she
has to stop and sniff it but it's very
beautiful it's a lovely day I dragged my
dad out for a walk tonight you did I
said I'm going for a walk with Nala
you're coming music now I was like nope
come on let's go
so today I am driving back home and then
Jo is coming oh what have you found and
then he's going to stay the night so I
am most excited look how beautiful this
place is
it's so nice and quiet Nala come on
I love this stuff I don't know what I
think it's cow is it cow parsley I
didn't I just had a right old pallava
didn't we dad we walked past this garden
and then this car and van went past and
thing anything of it and we heard
someone beeping and we turned around and
a man in a van and then a woman in a car
behind had to slam on their brakes
because a dog had run out of someone's
garden into the road and he got out of
his van and he was like where's this dog
come from and then the dog ran over to
Nala and wasn't impressed with her shall
we say so I had to like lift her up his
dog was like but like I was snarling it
was like trying to attack her or
something and the man was like with the
dog come from then we had to try and
find out where the dog had come from we
think it just escaped from someone's
garden but make sure of your dogs in
your guard
and so it's enclosed because that was
very close he almost hit the dog and he
was really shaken up
so hopefully that dog will not stay in
the garden well there's another dog in a
garden there we go
that's a good example of a dog staying
in a garden come on then
she's loving this walk Oh if any of you
wondering this is a lead that helps her
to train to walk with us she gets very
excited on walks and the lead has to be
loose which is now because we've already
been on a quiet walk but when she first
comes out she gets very excited so you
use the front one to give a little tug
not hard tug just a little kind of like
stay with me and it's working really
well
she's walking really nicely now and it's
still a comfortable harness but it just
means that she is learning to walk with
us instead of walking us sometimes she
gets very excited and she walks on two
legs which isn't helpful so the front
bit helps her to stay on four legs
basically did you enjoy that walk did
you enjoy it part from the dog that
tried to jump on you she's thirsty now
she just drank a whole bowl of water
draw some more good girl Hey oh you're
so cute
Hey hi boys I'm back
oh what a long drive that one and you
are very good Nala she was so cute um
I'm just going through my post because
me and I'll feel so bad emptying our
post box we get so much junk that we
just don't look in it
we've even got one of those little signs
that says no junk please
I'm pretty sure that actually makes
people put more junk in there and I was
just going through my post and I don't
really talk about charities that I
personally work with I talk a lot about
charities online that I want to support
and I want you guys to help support but
I also do a lot in my personal life that
um I just don't share because I just
kind of feel like I don't need to you
know that I'm right focus it's probably
best I'm not because I'm having it kind
of bad skin day um but I do a lot of
other things with charities that I like
to work with closely kind of just on a
more of a like an anonymous level and I
just thought I would mention this one
because it is something that I feel like
is very very rewarding I feel like a lot
of obviously anything that anyone could
do charity is always a rewarding feeling
but um I have sponsored children in
various countries which technically
means you pay a fee each month you can
choose what that is which kind of just
helps children in third world countries
children who are struggling to live
their life until they don't need you
anymore
and so I have some sponsored children
and I got this in the post today and it
honestly just melted my heart one of the
little girls I've sponsored drew me this
and sent me this and I just thought that
was the cutest thing I'm I wish my
fridge was magnetic because I would put
it on the fridge but um yeah basically I
just opened
in my post and it made me feel so like
emotional I was like well this is so
cute and then I thought you know I'm
just gonna mention this in a vlog I
don't normally but um yeah I just I just
thought it was really really durable
amongst all that oval junk mail there
was something that was so lovely I'm
also kind of hungry why do I want to eat
don't know then I also got hiccups so
Joe's here now oh hey we've just learned
