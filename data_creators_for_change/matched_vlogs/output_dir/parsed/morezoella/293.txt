good morning everybody it is now Monday
has it been a week yet since I've been
doing booking it has hasn't it
what's today first of September I mean
only eight yeah yeah John a week myself
Alfie Louie and knock Estonia Marcus are
all going to go for breakfast at Bill's
this morning I have never actually had
breakfast in bills and a lot of people
actually rate bills most for the
breakfast personally I love the halloumi
burger that's my fave what you're
laughing at so I'm very impatient is
recommence
oh there's always one or a few um so
yeah Louise just got up you got fed now
Louie like you can't really see a
serious I bet they're home the boys went
to bed at half-past five last night so
no wonder they're tired
um I am wearing some Doc Martens I
bought these a while ago and I feel like
you bought them off dice at all so no I
wanted them for aged when we went into
the shop and I was contemplating which
ones to get all of you to man
yeah I know I saw that today and I heard
them for a while I just I feel like I
don't know if I can pull them off or not
because I've got quite small feet I feel
like I look really good clumpy I don't
know but also the thing with Doc Martens
is you really have to kind of wear them
in I'm right now I've never worn before
so they feel slightly uncomfortable but
I think they're those kind of shoes that
the more you wear the more comfortable
they get so and also I really want to
wear these a lot in the autumn winter so
I want them to be comfy for them cool
what's good - Bill's running slightly
late because Percy decided to start like
choking like coughing and I've never
seen him do that obviously guinea pig
sneeze but that's more like this was
mullet and he kept on coughing and I was
like what's wrong with him like giving
him a little hug and stroking everything
like it's okay and then we figured out
it's because greedy guinea pigs eat too
quickly and because they can't vomit
they have to cough to make the food that
might be stuck they've tried to eat you
quickly go back into the stomach so
that's what he was doing but it freaked
me out I was like he's choking oh my god
I need to get him to a vet we're going
to bills now I'm very overprotective
mummy Nicole
it's min bobbin Maki and we're all here
