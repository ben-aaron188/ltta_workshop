good morning everybody and welcome to
vlogmas day 12 we're halfway through
already
so this morning I have had a shower wash
my hair done my hair done my makeup
covered this colossal spot and have
edited and uploaded my vlog we've also
had our friends Ryan and Carol over I'll
insert a couple of clips of that in here
now because Alfie took his camera out
and I didn't so I'm hoping Alfie got
some footage Ryan made us both some
BMXers which is so cool she's gonna
blitz the bike I'm talking weird because
I have like wind chill I went out and I
didn't put hat on I didn't put any
gloves on and now I'm really suffering
and I can't hear myself talking but I
have run up here now because I have a
Skype call with my therapist which as I
said a couple of vlogs ago it's always
like my top top priority and then after
that I need to tidy the house a little
bit get it all nice and ready wrap up a
couple more presents for Tanya and
Martha and then Tanya and Jim are coming
over which I'm really excited about I
feel like we haven't seen them in a
really really long time and I absolutely
love hanging out with them I love them
to pieces and we always just have like
the most cozy like festive time I've got
some come bears we're going to be making
pizzas tonight which I'm really excited
about and yeah we're just gonna have
like a chilled afternoon / evening I
think we were planning on going
ice-skating but Todd doesn't actually
like I fit in which for some reason I
didn't know and she was like it's fine
though I can watch you and I was like no
let's just like all chill together
because ultimately that is what we like
to do we like each other's company so it
doesn't really matter what we're doing
they're coming at about 4 o'clock I've
got this cool now I've just got a couple
more worki bits to do after this cool
and then we're all good for the evening
it's gonna be really really nice cool is
done
and tan and Jim are currently on their
way I thought so much to do Alfie is in
town he's picking up Jim's present
because we weren't really too sure what
to get him and Alpha's just found the
perfect thing so I really hope he likes
it and I need to now finish wrapping you
two more of tans presents and markers
but it's now time to blip this room
because it's quite messy right now okay
the living rooms a little bit tidier
I've got some cupcakes out I've got the
quality Street open because I know Tom
loves them and this is potpourri which
I'm hoping no one gets confused by I'm
gonna open my day twelve on the old
chocolate calendar right where are we 12
can you juggle three snowballs
probably not oh this one's not your one
puppy right are we gonna know what this
is today it's an elf yep I can see that
perfect mmm
put this up next Alfie's I keep leaving
it around
for any of you that haven't seen alfea's
vlogs
this is his calendar My Little Pony
movie and yes that was his choice it's
never a Tanya burr and Jim Chapman visit
without a little bit of camembert so I'm
gonna pop some camembert in so then
hopefully when they arrive it will be
just right I think it's the perfect
snack basically Tanya and Jim are here

with two years ago I know how crazy is
that it's gone so quickly yeah I know
be gone there's a massive Fault in the
garden oh where is he gone he's going up
the hill for humans in there yeah I
wonder what they're doing well why is he
gone he's definitely not left the garden

think I'll wait for the strawberry

if I like the two things separately yeah
I like a roast and I will do like
chocolate I wouldn't ask up on a roast

expect you to make a much worse place
than that
oh the strawberry overpowers that
camembert which I don't know how that
happens nobody does anymore camembert
