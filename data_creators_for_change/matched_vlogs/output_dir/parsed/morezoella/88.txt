hello everybody it is Friday the week
has finally got to the end it's not
tapping noise I hope you liked my little
morning montage I immediately got up
this morning and just tidied because I
have my mum and my grandparents coming
this weekend but I also have a very busy
day today so I wasn't sure if I was
gonna get all the time I needed in order
to make the house tidy I mean this is an
utter mess but I'm gonna tackle that
later and thankfully they're not staying
in my bedroom we also had somebody in
this morning fixing something in our
ensuite let me just check it actually
because he laughed and said he finished
but okay yeah fine fix it good and I had
a shower and I wash my hair and I combed
my hair I love when my hair is cold but
my god I hate curling it it's just one
of those like really laborious I really
like that word I don't use that enough
it's a really laborious task to be
completely honest with you
and even when I start doing it it's like
it pains me like I hate curling my hair
I wish I had salmon Adam everyday to
curl my hair basically wanna come a
little bar car
oh look I want to show you this actually
so for a housewarming party
Carly and Leon kindly bought this neon
flamingo and it is the coolest thing
look and I mean it's like they knew the
vibe I was going for because I also have
this little gold flamingo and over here
this pink flamingo with where's Carly
gave it to me she was like oh my god
this is perfect for your dining room and
you're right Carly it is
so perfect for this dining room and yeah
there it is
I honestly do feel like this is one of
my favorite rooms in the house like this
is like my favorite view after the house
I'm gonna show it to you now so you can
see what I'm talking about
like maybe this this is like one of my
favorite things to look at you got like
the disco balls down here the green
we've got that big piece of art that we
had in our old house that's got loads
and loads of colours in it you can see
these and you can see this which is what
poppy Shaun Amanda and Nick bought me
for my birthday this big like convex
concave mirror I don't know which one
the chairs oh this is my new little plum
I bought yesterday which I'm obsessed
with I really don't want to kill that
and then you can see the bar cart and
now you can see the little flamingo but
you can also see the artwork that Alfie
bought me for Christmas
yeah I just love this room a lot this is
kind of like a mini tour but I feel like
it's finally done
I guess this one and it is one of my
absolute favorite rooms it's actually
quite a lot of people's favorite room
but yes there you go Carly and Leon
bought me and Alfie this lovely wingo
and I just think it looks so great on
the bar cart next to that picture today
is a fairly busy day because myself and
Alfie are shooting some photos for a
very exciting project which we sort of
gave you a little hint yesterday with a
gif on Twitter and so many of you flip
Nala she's like a little skip so many of
you guessed and screenshotted which is
crazy because we made the gift so quick
we knew some of you would screenshot it
because you're all like super duper
detectives I didn't realize so many of
you would sit and like continuously
screenshot until you actually got the
shot which gave you a little hint I will
actually explain exactly what it is
later on today but we are going to be
going out
he's some photos of that I believe Joe
and after you've already taken photos to
that but I haven't yet so I also just
got these packages so I thought I would
open these whilst I wait for Alfie
because he's not here yet and once again
I'm waiting for him before we go
anywhere but I'm gonna open these
packages see what they are
save this for a home where Hall but I
ordered from Urban Outfitters a bed like
bedding or peaches like how freaking
cute is this I don't know whether I want
to put it on the guest bed that I'm
gonna film in or on our bed we shall
soon see this is for sure a cushion if
you guys weren't aware already Urban
Outfitters do some great home where look
at them okay oh I love this this can go
on the bed as well maybe with the
peaches I actually do have more weight
there oh okay so because I'm getting
like totes organized before Christmas I
ordered some pine cones only some pine
cones for like autumnal flat days
basically
so this is from SOG so these are the
companies that make my brother and I
didn't have no oh yeah I didn't have any
of the wonder hand hand cream so I asked
them to send in to eat them because when
friends come round or family members I
like to have a little stash that I can
then give them or a stash for me to use
and some of the product
I was running quite low on so they sent
me sir oye Morshower shake my stash of
this got absolutely rinsed by all my
friends and family because they were so
excited to try it so I've got them to
send me some more so far I have been
absolutely loving all you guys is
feedback and review of the jelly in
gelato range I do look and I watch all
the videos and I love hearing your
feedback it's so important obviously and
it does appear that the shower shake is
proving to be one of the most popular
because I've never done a moisturizing
shower gel before so I was kind of a bit
uneasy as how many people would prefer
to use this over a normal shower gel but
everyone is loving it especially for
shaving your legs with and someone said
that in a review they were like oh use
it to show you my legs I was like that
is a genius idea and I felt like one of
my friends also said that that's what
they've done with it and now that's what
I use to shave my legs with also and
it's just so creamy and leaves my skin
feeling so soft so I needed some more of
that for myself also oh I think I think
this is all my product too
hand sanitizers yeah I had none of these
left and I swear by this wondrous wit I
have none of this left so glad approach
scoopa duper oh my love I have missed
not having this it's just what I always
use in my bath for like the best bubbles
shower stalls thank heavens has run out
of this as well I'm making the biggest
mess behind this camera this is the good
things come in threes mini fragrances
which I already have quite a few of but
now I have more soap opera also it's
really good for me to have a stash of
the products for photos for the social
accounts as well speaking of if you
don't already follow zoella lifestyle or
zoella beauty on Twitter and Instagram I
will leave links in the description box
so you can go on over and check them out
if you like pretty polished scrub for
any of you that were obsessed with a
tutti frutti scrub this is the same
formulation in the classic scent it is
the best ever I love it right
now I need to put all the products into
a box and tidy up this mess oops there
we go now I'm probably gonna have to ask
Alfie to carry this up to my office this
is way too heavy for me just heading
over to Alfie's office oh I'm gonna drop
this flattering angle
so that we can make our way to what did
I just drop out so that we can make our
way to the artists residence just start
the photo shoot I'm really hungry we've
had the last of the photos developed
from the housewarming that is literally
the most vile picture of me I've ever
seen in my life

easy to listen to it's so cute

go yeah you haven't got much time let's
travel the UK yeah travels the UK is
called the labyrinth there's a slide
that's 40 foot high are you proud of me
by the way I'm so proud of you I did
Sam's already I'm so hard I the hardest
bit first bit well you have to jump down
onto your bum see if it was on to your
feet it wouldn't be so bad but he was
like jump on your bum or you'll hurt
your feet I was like oh my god it's so
hard like that I hated that it was
really hard I whenever he tries to teach
me things on the trampoline I could
never do them because I just have this
like inability to be completely like
relaxed doing things like that it's like
my body just completely goes against
everything that you're supposed to do so
when he's saying you have to make sure
you land on your bum I'm like I don't
think I can like I honestly think I'm
gonna have to land on my feet
and it's the same when Alfie tries to
teach me stuff on the trampoline it's
like my body does does not do what it's
supposed to do I feel like
most people would like nip into the
petrol station and grab a bottle of
water or but the coke no just can you
just hold it again how you're holding it
to now I'm gonna hold when I'm driving
I'm driving you can show that icon Alfie
comes out with a freaking Cunha yeah

coconut just healthy you know it smells
so bad
do you not think okay try it smells like
no I don't like coconut water okay yeah

prefer it but it's not fresh trust me

funny I wanted to point out
still good on there I am lying in bed
editing my 40-minute block when I get
cool from Alfie
