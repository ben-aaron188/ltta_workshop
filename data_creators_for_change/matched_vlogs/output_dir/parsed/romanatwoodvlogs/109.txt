action action Jackson it feels like
we're kids again like all this snow is
amazing we got the the pit crew in the
house switching the tracks over to the
tires which man I always say we could we
could have a lot of fun in that snow at
these tracks right now but we have not I
am not experienced it without the track
so we got a got a switch it also yeah
right it's like having brand new pair of
shoes all over again it's just like
their new shoes on you move faster

you can feed it through the hole you
already got this on these are all on Oh
looks like a little baby without the

so the boys want to get put which is fun
we hook all the sleds up to the quad and
we pull up a what if we hooked one of
these giant slip boards on it you guys

think it'd be fun no yeah Audrey yeah so
I'll take this vest strap off right and
we'll replace it with a rope and then
tie rope here to the quad boom done just
a daddy's a genius just say it that's
the fun part you're supposed to slide
