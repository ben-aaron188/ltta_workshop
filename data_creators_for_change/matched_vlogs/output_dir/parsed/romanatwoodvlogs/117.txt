alright how's this work came this I
don't understand where does this pop on
to here okay
spring yeah no yeah no you got it you
don't like the toilet
what's the matter sleepyhead seems like
maybe a week we've been going pretty
hard outside everything from just snow
to vehicles to ramps so pulling on tubes
it's just been an outdoor adventure all
week so today Sunday came around and we
took it very easy so easy that we were
like we haven't even filmed today so
we're picking up the camera right now
this evening we're hanging out we're
gonna just goof off as a family we got
this extremely exciting toilet the cane
has been wanting to poop in all day
you're not supposed to go the bathroom
in it right Wow what should we do right
now oh my gosh is that a real thing okay
don't scare him don't don't scare him
he's right there okay there's this crazy
trick that we've never tried if you've
seen these videos of cats where you put
a cucumber behind me in it really it
didn't work did you try to talk sir that
job well if you've already tried and
didn't work does it
apparently cats were terrified of
cucumbers I don't understand it have you
said no you have to be like a special
okay just walk away
Coria you think it's gonna work do you
think it's gonna work Cora she's got her
eyes on I'll see what happens
why's everybody staring at me I think
good a lot it happen naturally of course
of course now the cat's gonna eat more
than he's ever eaten what if you don't
even see it Cora's going to get him
she's like it's taking too long I want
to see the cat now where are you going
girl I got to stay on the cat coz if he
does do it this is supposed to be that
close that's fun leave it leave it leave
it leave it leave it
oh that was so he didn't see it cuz he
knows you're there everything's safe
that was horrible that was the worst oh
geez okay you just tossing cucumbers at
this point that was a real big fail so
I've seen these videos we've all seen
them of people putting cucumbers behind
their cats and they freaked out like
they literally jump out of the camera
screen so I don't know what the deal is
with that cats cats can be pretty crazy
yeah they haven't developed the fear of
cucumbers yet okay so what is this how
does this work it's a toilet game you
just poop your pants I'm not doing that
I'm out okay so we're building building
a toilet system right now you understand
the game is the actual game she's
cruising all over this house now she's
like you guys build your toilet I'm
gonna be running around
come here Cara just like I can do it I
can do it I can do it once her beads say

scared of the dog just runs away with it
he's like you guys got me a cucumber you

you would want me um so we are gonna
attempt to just try to almost livestream

family playing some weird game that I've
never seen in my life and hopefully we
get to laugh together a little bit
tonight with this and just bring you
guys along so first you can't have the
cucumber kid you really take a bite

greens on geez no water begins this so
you spin the toilet paper whatever
number you get how many times you push
your hand ready okay okay did you fill

you guys up here I don't know it's no no
too much weight get your butt over or uh
we're up here
Cora hi baby like how do I get up there
that's a whole nother level I don't even
understand all that in what way it's not
in a spray it doesn't spray nothing it
doesn't care I ain't buying it of course
trying to do laundry Cora squirt from
where flash okay all right you want to
sample it gage show us how it works how
do you win the game if you hear a
flushing sound but no water sprayed when
you flush you're safe it's an ex-player
sperm you get sprayed by the flasher out
how do you win the game what is the
objective no not yet
okay so once you get sprayed you're out
okay okay cool let's do this
Yallah can go first I think only one
okay whatever it lands on is what you -

thirsty now he looks like the dog right
now trying to drink out of the toilet
