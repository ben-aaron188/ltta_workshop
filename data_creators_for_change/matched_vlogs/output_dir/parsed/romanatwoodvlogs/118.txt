might be frozen but it's race day baby
are you ready to race are you ready
you don't you're not even excited why
maybe all these guys out there you beat
them you gonna take them down
I'll sabotage them for you I'll shut
their cars off you know what the secret
is I figured this out on the right side
of the handlebars is the kill switch so
as you drive by you hit that switch and
kill the car yes okay
Cora Cora baby Cora
hey wait let's go all right let's go
flash you ready let's go race come on
come on okay I'll see you I hear like
one minute all right guys welcome to the
vlog hope you're having a perfect day we
are I'm kind of I'm starting today's
vlog exactly where I left off yesterday
we did a little current day yesterday
cuz I kind of spoiled the go-kart idea
so here we are we got a bunch of friends
out here family kids and actual living
donkey out here what's up fun you like
your coat huh must like it
we got the trackbill brah I think that's
Brian that's Brian chase we got a bunch
of couple special guests yeah who's this
mystery man what Dennis what's up bud
he's loving you right now he's like
throw me the ball throw me the snowball
let's go the trash a car chase is gonna
fashion the right
tearing up my track not even on the
track starting line in red because uh
well you can't really see white right
now you'll see that starting line it
actually looks like we're someone ate it
Oh Britt hey hey go redo it so I kind of
like country's idea he said for the
first for the first like go everybody
lines up everybody lines up their carts
on here and you drive off onto the track
to start the race not not down the ramp
but just we all line up and then y'all
start yeah I bet you the first cart that
hits that little mouse right no I drove
this snowmobile down that okay
so before our crazy right I mean we've
already been all over this but we bought
a chase mr. kind of the father figure of
the group said I brought a big drill bit
you're a father too Wow I know but I
know the ice is fine there I know the
ice is fine
I'm not scared I just want to make sure
everybody knows you got to be you got to
take the right book a father-figure
other group that's all I'm saying we
wanted us to measure the ice before that
but once we came out here's like oh it's
fine you gotta be close oh yeah just 20
inches get a good measurement here you
gotta be able to hook it use that bit
right there
nine inches just shy of nine inches all
right doesn't move for a couple days
four inches
is the minimum thickness for people to
be on right eight inches is the minimum
thickness for ATV V so we're safe with
go-karts oh yeah
and how much does each person way it's
dispersed it doesn't count
it's a whole floating island right now
Brian and country can't be on it get a
flash get a flash don't take that don't
take that yeah he's loving that he loves
playing that snow yeah I'm waiting for
him to just bite your but we got to get
we got a gift when we're gonna get to
warm up and practice on this guys all
right so hop in crash easy easy baby
easy Papa huh
not ready I want my girl ready to race
we gotta win this let's go
see ya holy it is you gotta get right on
there
get on the racetrack

wipeout okay just a second lap coming
around Lisi Oh Oh Britney run the second
one so turn that here we go
here he goes who's Oh Roman a couple
inches all right
you took that race I'll be back I'll be
back for more so we've gone from racing
to now go-kart hockey basically shooting
hockey pucks at the driver not to hit
him he has to stop the part here's the
truth we gotta get serious about this
race because what's happening is we're
just going out there and we're moving
off we're just playing
clay time had to put air in all these
tires because they're going flat from
our screws wasn't the smartest idea and
Brian owes me money I don't care what he
says he bet me a hundred dollars you
know what he pulled you know what he
pulled though they're not all flat
they're flat you guys ready to get
serious
mom we go race we got a race got to race
race what we're so goofing off playing
off it's pole row come on out there
sleeping sleep sleeping is that what you
were that why are you ready when you get
her out which one this has got to come
out to the pond I'll just run you're the
last guy that we need in there mr.
can-am himself not sure exactly how
we're gonna moderate this race but we're
gonna get serious here fill them up to
them up we're making some adjustments
the things are superfast when we adjust
them so we're doing that to all the
karts real quick we're gonna get the
drone in the sky which looks really cool
out here and we're just gonna go just go
with it have fun and hopefully we can
capture the best that's the best we can
from you guys but either way I'm having
so much fun that I can't decipher what I
filming what I'm like and I'm like I'm
not filming every time you hit somebody
it's a penalty
I didn't know what you're talking about
why will she get me Britt Brody and
Brian five lap race here we go dad I
don't know no no inside lane has to

place for you haha
