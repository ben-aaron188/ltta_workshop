what's up guys good morning to you
I got uh mr. Mandel here with me today
and we are out and about trying to shoot
a new prank
you got a pretty funny one today I'll
show you in a second we had to find a
craft store today craft store well not
really we needed a hardware but I think
this has what we need just say what's up
are you tired oh he's such did I step in
his shit dude oh my god
pervy dude
no it's a sticker it's a sticker hey hey
big dog did you miss me even trying to
add nothing just ran out Alex had to get
Harvey some dog food the dog probably
just started eat like crazy
makes me miss Zeus in here all these
toys so this is probably living it up
right now playing with bow running
around you know coming into and like an
all-natural organic pet store makes me
wonder if our animals are eating better
than we are
I mean I'm not eating turkey and ducks
do lamb and beef stew look at this dude
I'm never gonna hurt I didn't know they
made dog food like this on a second this
is like they have a freezer section for
daughters
unbelievable primal I don't know about
you guys but these power lines always
scare the crap out of me
you hear that all right so we just warp
to the beautiful Santa Monica this is a
beautiful place to prank it's also right
on the beach today we're gonna see how
people react when I chase them with poop
on my shoe
not really chase them but if they run I
might I might I might follow see what
happens really windy smile this is
pointless
what's up it's kind of a bad area though
if you think about it like it's
dangerous people pulling snake pranks
all the time out here I wish I had that
on a string that's what we need on a
string right now this prank is actually
going really good I've been literally
chasing people with just the little pile
of poop on my shoes dude would you would
you run from that shitty prank that's
what it should be called the shitty
prank shitty shitty ass prank ever in it
this is where humans go to be awesome
I know what it feels like to fall from
that height imagine
we are wrapping up for the day this
uncertain asset and I hate having that
mixed sunlight in my videos I'm so picky
picky picnic EPT and my hair is just
falling apart
I think from jumping and stuff anyway we
are headed back to Alex's I gotta get my
