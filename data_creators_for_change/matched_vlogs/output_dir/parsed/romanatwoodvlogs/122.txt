all right 57 miles on this thing it's
not bad we're about to have a lot more I
want to head up north maybe Michigan or
even Canada and play they got so much
snow can you imagine how deep I think I
just blew PPP it's like pulling up to
the paint spray right there pull up pull
up to the door it opens we're going yo
or go with tracks stop it yo this is
this is clean this is spotless before we
got here man that's Kondos thing is
jacked up my goodness this is for just
like mud-dogging that is wicked it's
literally a little tank amazing you guys
remember the one we had out at my pawn
it was it was this one actually might
have been the same same one oh the track
sell it guys I love true obviously I
love tracks but that is so cool imagine
just mountain like a paintball Gatling
gun
like bad it's got the rock floor
so we're jumping around a little bit
because it's been about two hours since
my last clip they have a wash bay built
inside here so they're able to wash it
clean and get it very perfect
so these decals this wrap can go on here
and Brian forgot there were stickers on
there ask one sec dude it's crucial oh
look at all that glue that'll stick up
so basically it's night let me clean my
lens this thing is pill you guys so the
main TV camera clean is basically she's
all cleaned up and ready for decals
chase is gonna run some GoPro time
lapses so we have like some cool video
but being wrapped and worked on and yeah

don't know what i should show cuz i kind
of just like one of them situations
where do i show you the whole process
the making of this or do I wait until
it's all done to reveal it but I guess I
probably I don't know I should just show
the works of it I think at this point
it's not much of a surprise so I'm just
gonna bring you along on the ride
basically every single there's a lot of
panels on this thing they're everywhere
each piece has its own part
to make this rap complete and basically
basically each panel comes on these
giant sheets and this is how it's gonna
be wrapped I can show you a section that
he's already done over here check this
out
so here is this side in the works and
