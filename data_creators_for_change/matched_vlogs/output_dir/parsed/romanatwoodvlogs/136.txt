what is it flash what is that who is
that what is it John Oh sup boys oh you
brought the Big Dawg a bit kid you it
was there a bigger one flag that's what
you just came with a year supply of
popcorn yo what's going on the hot tub
Brian there's
dirt or soap look what is that oh gosh
dot you don't watch it with dial come on
with some where this guy goes you ready
bring this thing in well I hope to think
Fitz man I'll tell you guys well first
of all welcome to the vlog yesterday we
had kind of an argument with chase that
this would mount on this rack in here
and if it doesn't let me show you that
mounting bracket will fit any TV you can
buy your sure 100% if you ain't got the
regular size it would have been no
problem santahat so here's the only
issue that we're gonna have with this if
any maybe it's gonna be fine hopefully
it will be our TV stan is concreted into
our wall like it's it's literally built
into the house so if this original rack
doesn't fit I don't know what a lot of
duct tape gonna need that duct tape
Brian dude that is a monster TV you see
that stand by the box stand by the box
you're almost as big as the box dude you
can that can be your new four oh my gosh
this thing is so big I never had TV this
big in my life so crazy it's just the
box we left the TV at countries us oh so
just the port for the kids
same way you tricked me on my new bike
yeah I keep open as the old TVs in here
it's just a box think of that 82 feet by
where's your you're not wearing your
mandatory work attire oh man I'd spend
money for you to look good at work there
you go that's it hey hey what do you
think of that I'm not
no that's so you can that's so you can
mount it and then peel those off yeah oh
no it's not gonna fit oh my gosh
so wrong ah so this only goes to 20
inches wat wait what if we just pull
this out movies over what do you mean
you can't do anything we put your mind
to it
find dirt we could probably take it
apart
rig it just hi baby
I heard you crying in there and mommy
Saviour hi Liza what are you doing
where's your daddy what's he doing
cooking cookies I need him take me to
take me hey you remember how you said
that TV mount would just hold any TV
yeah yeah it's four inches too small so
close bro so Brian's gonna run out and
pick up a new hopefully a new mount
we'll rig up to that TV in that wall
it's such a pain cuz it's concreted in
there it's such a good idea while he
does that we got a bunch of fan mail

very long time so let's rip open some

Patrick Patrick McCarthy Patrick McCarty
I believe he sends all he says these are
his he says these were my childhood
comic books and I want no one came to
have them dude there's the entire box of
comic books here oh my gosh dude look at
all these kings yoli's that's crazy what
happened what was it well how did that
happen
I had my copy it was gonna fall over say
what to grab it with this handy that way
oh nice
okay so chase may or may not have just
completely redeemed himself on the whole
TV won't fit think you mean to me I'm
not kidding Brian and country been gone
for hours how many hours for hours hours
and hours they have been gone and chase
just walks in and he goes why don't we
just move these bars to this knob
because that's where this is on a
different knob yeah so underneath each
of these screws is the same knob right
here right this is a universal mount
goes for any size TV so you just take
these brackets and move them over and
then they fit oh my gosh dude
imagine they get they get back in the
TVs hung up after all them hours queen
of the world she's like okay I'm gonna
go poop now they're gonna flip FL IP
dude the key they're gonna be here
anytime I have a feeling they're
literally gonna walk in any time flashes
here probably so here's the only catch
Brian actually has one of four mounting
bolts because he took it with him to see
if it would fit the TV now we only have
three it'll hang like for what what okay
bad news - bad things - first bad news
is that we don't have enough bolts to
hang it at all these don't even fit
properly second thing is that they're
here they just pulled up so is a
lose-lose anyway but the good news is
you get to you know right you get to be
right you probably thought I was wrong I
was the first one to say
you and you you did it
where'd you go to Albuquerque to pick
that thing up stay live my gosh horse
country look at it it lines right up
well this is crazy this is just crazy
look look at that it is exactly built
for that TV bro I don't know what
happened while you were gone for six
hours seven hours but that baby fits we
can examine the exam and we didn't take
anything like four different screws wait
these screws right here we inverted it
flipped it stupid we use it the way it's
meant to be used and that is universally
right I kind of break it go ahead go and
tell him these brackets were on this set
of knobs now they're on all this set of
knobs say how it was up there however we
still need that because here's the thing
these are about a quarter inch too short
so really all we need is two dollar
bolts how much was that some bucks
yellow country hey welcome back who did
that yes oh no that's all it came with
yeah dude not even at all this TV mount
works perfect chase figured it out he
was right this whole time
you know oh can I say son I'm gonna be
on to you so time ever I was driving I
took upon myself to watch the video that
uploaded and he was like I swear to you
I know for a fact that TV's gonna fit
though it's nighttime so oh so when we
measured that are you working right now
are you on the clock you're not wearing
the proper attire how it was up there
what I'm not fed that wasn't the
argument come on man this is you guys
his last opportunity to pull this off
stores will be shut I was just a wing
made a wheel man thing is we talked
about that moving that mount out and
what you told me face it goes country
I'm the one that does the bill we're all
full now because we have made our words
all right you just got a mint defeat hey
Kate says don't drop it
good advice little man we take the legs
off after a parent oh my gosh dude I
can't lift I can only guy I can get in
the middle and after blog dude that
looks so scary you kidding oh my god
somebody's fingers is all over it chase
whatever you're doing you're doing it
just just hold it there you got it
boom well that's like weird
yeah hold the antenna why they call him
the Candyman
that's why they call him the Candyman
yeah go eat you can have one monster
