yeah that's easy definitely sure like
what age 13 15 I don't I don't remember
how old but I dude I had terrible dreams
as a kid I would run straight up
did you like the middle middle was the
middle was like the safest place but
it's just wherever they they put me like
did you go to one side like when Kane
comes in and then all night comes to my
side yeah I just yeah I don't remember
it but I definitely definitely after
badgering went into my parents bed yeah
yeah until they never let me but I don't
remember him being like you can't sleep
here it was just like sleep on the side
with my mom so I always run their first
side but it's worth it okay you don't I
think everybody everybody but like did
you sleep on your mom or your dad that
or did you sleep on the middle where
right good just whatever
it's like safe places in there and the
bedroom would be safer than my room with
that okay next question have you ever
