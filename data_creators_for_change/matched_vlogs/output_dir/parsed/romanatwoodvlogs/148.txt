for that Tower take that water me
personally as cold as that warden and
what if it's colder deeper you go down
no no technically technically it should
now be warmer below yeah think about it
the ground is always the same
temperature what's the temperature of
the earth roughly something like that
all right the top of the water is the
coldest right now I could be wrong but
the deeper the water right now should be
the temperature of the ground the top of
the water should be the coldest yeah
