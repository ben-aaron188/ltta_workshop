hi pretty girl I'm gonna eat that Fox
give me that Fox welcome to the vlog I'm
going out here you guys look busy no
it's too busy for me I'll be out here if
you need me just doing stupid stuff
alright guys welcome to the what's up in
your standing guard standing flesh I'm
allowed to touch my donkey all right
chill mr. Jose but today I've been what
I've been talking about this for a while
there's something I was working on and
today I'm gonna finally I'm doing it no
matter what today is the day so I'm
gonna go out here try to explain what
I'm doing get it give get it girl oh
he's not going fast enough he not going
fast enough
so as you guys know I built this giant
tabletop right here and it is uh-oh here
we go
what is that Gil so I built this giant
tabletop it's like 30 40 maybe I don't
haven't even measured it's like 44 long
basically and the idea
whew I mean I'd the idea of this
tabletop
I can't even film it's distracting the
idea behind this tabletop was to build
something that I can get used to jumping
over a lot and then cut it out and put
whatever I want inside the middle you
doctor you can't dump her like that
she's still alive what happened up there
huh so you do to our beautiful
handlebars they're still great not about
you lose grip what did you just have
popcorn see the foot pegs I mean they're
a little small Oh got it so I have one
idea and maybe it's just completely
stupid which makes sense but I have one
item that I want to put in between this
jump something that no man has ever done
before no not you I wouldn't know jump
naki donkey donkey put your baby in the
cat and that suit ulcer tooth all you
know what I think we keep it a mystery
for now and Brian you should just start
cutting around just empty her out take
this gigantic hill and cut it out Oh
that chase won't be able to play up here
no more that's true cuz he's landing
like two foot here why don't you plan on
that one it's for the babies yeah
I think it feels a little stupid to wash
her before she gets dirty not a man I
know what you guys are thinking this is
stupid
like it really is stupid but I've had
this idea once I get an idea in my head
I can't stop watch Johnny this she's
gonna be pretty look at her dirty she's
lonely in the garage you can get out
play fun I'm angry what is that
it's me behind in the country so we have
iron water which means if I don't get
the water off of this thing it dries
like white Biddy like it's very hard to
get off and out on the proper towels to
dry my car up so I'm gonna take this
baby down the road it's a lot more clean
is it gonna work is it gonna work here's
what we've got we've got this perfect
hole designed and made safely I don't
know how the idea came about but I was
like I've never jumped my GTR like we
had we've had people jump over it with
things I was like I want to jump over it
with things yeah really dumb idea really
bet like this is one of them things that
like it's probably gonna go perfectly
smooth but for any reason it goes bad
yeah the whole world mad at me a super
viral video though I did it sound like a
really good idea but now that it's like
go time I'm kind of like not wanting to
pull pull my car into it and there's
like no test there's no test time it's
all fun and games
no I feel I wouldn't look when I do
stupid things even though they're really
stupid I'm usually very very confident
that everything will be completely this
is be good and fun and cool it'll be a
great photo it'll be a good shot for the
wall the x3 stalls right at the lip that
would be horrendous this thing would
literally land on the roof of the car
the odds of that happening I don't see a
happening I honestly there's no chance
there is a chance but it's not gonna
happen the idea looks worse and worse as
I get closer to it
dude that roof is awfully close dude oh
my gosh
yep bad idea dude oh it's super stupid
I'm starting to second-guess it
I didn't know the roof what the ramp was
taller than the car no you just like use
the roof as just a cap why you gonna
jump my car dude he better not is he
really gonna jump it I'm gonna kill him
I'm gonna kill him
don't play the what if game with me we
don't we never play the what if game be
my passenger come on be my passenger I
need my girl by my side yes yes no now
the good thing is if something goes
wrong it's not just one it'd be my fault
well your passenger you know like they
left corner right corner you gotta call
the shots you gotta call the shots man I
think this is just as bad as use doing
the tattoo on your face dude rock paper
scissors I win your car we put your car
in there if I win what oh come on we put
the Jaguar in there oh man I hate I hate
when you put this thing in front of my
face oh I think it's too late to turn
back but it would look as sweet imagine
your photo you'd have rock show
everybody I love you I didn't know the
roof would be popping out I thought
that's no good I thought when Brian said
he built a job you'd do it right
one drones gonna be just hovering
inspires get it whatever Chase wants to
do with it I just want to go like I
don't like hesitating the more you think
about something the more you talk
yourself out of it I just want to go I
know everything's gonna be fine we're
gonna do this jump everyone's gonna be
great yeah we were going with me
why not that's what I said
hi baby ready do this helmet helmets off
you guys on the other side of the ramp
all intact
cut it down all dodgey baby could've
done it without you know the only reason
well I live in the dust storm that hit
it everything's good I'm like you will
put the Jag under there good jump boom
good filming all right it's bath time
she's covered in fine little Dusty's
like just take me back to the garage and
let me sleep I say job well done
I went perfect she's a little dirty
dusty but that's because that's cuz
there was water on it you know what
water off yeah I think for them I'll get
you a new license plate cover that's all
I'm gonna get you something I love when
we do something and it just works like
no failure no error not like that I'm
getting I'm getting good with and if
your order the new Christmas order this
is a good chance you're gonna get one
sign because I have signed so many of
these it takes so long to it's like let
me look at this I can only do one it
deed takes me a while like honestly it
takes me a while and I can't just stack
them cuz this stuff doesn't dry
instantly so I've to like carry I don't
know
so I partnered up with this app called
cheese if you don't you probably have it
if you don't have it go get it it's
completely free but what's funny is I
started my cheese account yesterday and
I didn't tell anybody I didn't tell you
guys I just started an account I posted
the GTR jump like a teaser before before
anywhere so it was like a teaser on
there and I didn't tell anybody it was
even my account everybody thought the
accounts fake I think everybody still
for this minute thinks that it's a fan
account so do me a favor if you don't
have the app already go get the app I'll
link in my description it's totally free
follow me and tell everybody that it is
not a fan or tell everybody it is a fan
account let's start a like a crazy war
on but it's super cool and they wanted
to work with me and it's always an honor
and it's fun to try to start something
new and grow it so check the app out
again it's free it's called cheese and
I'm on there and right now everybody
thinks it's a fan account so I will link
my actual account follow me if you guys
want to play
along with the whole fan account thing
I'm okay with that if you want to if you
want to try to argue with people it
thinks it's a fan account be my guest
and just post stuff that I wouldn't
normally post on the vlog or I don't
know just randomness I'm going to sign
my little heart away right now on these
and then edit this vlog because I'm
super excited to see it's weird you've
already seen it but super excited to see
the jump and Brittany's reaction and all
that so I love you guys so so much thank
you for all this for all the love
everything you do for us as a family we
will see you tomorrow you are beautiful
