guys are having an awesome day we came
back from vacation very buried in and
just things that we left behind when we
leave for two weeks we get buried with
actual life obligations so he came home
a little bit buried I was like we're not
gonna miss the day we're not gonna miss
a day and today we did not film at all
so we're coming on here right now hang
out for just a bit and just keep the
streak going baby let's keep the streak
going we've done really well we're at
like 20 plus which is huge for us lately
I can you know how long you've Moo had
this desk I can never remember whose is
whose
no no she'll be like the keys for the
trucker and Veronica's desk and I come
in here I have to open every single desk
cause I don't know whose this is
so anyway and days like this you guys
always seem to enjoy when we tell you a
little bit about ourselves more than we
would normally do in a vlog usually we
show things in a vlog but today kind of
like a QA basically where you guys have
asked us questions in the past and we
try to answer them the best we can also
all these boxes around these tables and
pallets because all of our merch always
has to be off the ground everything has
to be on tables on shelves on pallets at
least a little just not always Todd's
not always we've had accidents we have a
thousand gallon fish tank here and then
another thousand gallons of water in
this room but basically you're always at
risk that water can leak
and bringing out and ruin a bunch of
merchandise so where's the light oh I
think I've showed you guys this before
but this entire room closet basically
it's not a big room but it's a lot of
stuff crammed into this room all of this
just to run that aquarium it is
unbelievable this is the fish tank room
pumps and this is a skimmer that
basically filters out all that look at
all the dirt fish poo and then this guy
I don't even know what all this does
really it's on computers whoa you scared
the crap out of me I did not know you
were in here Chucky's dog Jaime fish
tank dog can monitor all of our
aquariums from his house on his computer
all the water levels the temperatures
everything so if something goes wrong he
can adjust it from home I think that
sounds a little scientific try to scare
me boy you trying to scare me did mommy
run inside tomorrow's a very fun normal
family crazy vlog that I've been working
on for a while actually before we even
went on vacation I was working on it so

say like oh I wish I like had my you
know dive license or something you're
just like I'm going to do it and get it
done right now okay I want this and you
like do everything you can to do it like
when you got the X so you're like I'm
getting x3 and you literally went and
got it that's my strength my ability to
just blow money I know I feel like I'm
putting you in a corner here it's I
remember when we want to cruise together
you wanted this watch it was $200 right
literally for the entire week you talked
about how you could make the money to
get that watch and you went home and
sold a piece of your camera
goodbye like remade the money it's like
like you just figure out ways to get
things that you want Wow I want that but
I'm like yeah that that's a great story
I forgot all about that and I'll get
that money she's now my blog camera
costs way more than that watch I stopped
the watch yeah somewhere this next
questions for me
Rowan what a Brit strengths weaknesses
I'm gonna start with your strengths
because I love it I love it about you
your strength is your is your patience
your patience you mean that's my
weakness know your page okay first of
all your patience with me and all my
crazy ideas
you're always patient with number two
this little one right here this little
one right here you're beyond patient I
don't know how you do it before in the
morning babies crying and Brits just so
patient calm I mean honestly you have so
many strengths so many you gave birth
with no medication in our bedroom on our
bed that is I couldn't do it 90% of us
watching right now couldn't do that
that's strong I'm giving you some
strength credit right there your
weakness if I had to pick one weakness
it's just hard
maybe pizza that yeah like a real true
weakness like a like a like a real
weakness guy that's hard to come up with
I really am trying I'm really trying I
cannot think of like
you do sit too much no it's like she
could walk into okay that's good that's
fair you can walk into a room she'll be
the first one to find something just
like a chair in the far corner she'll be
sit on it before you even get inside I
got since I met her literally she does
her makeup on the counter in the
bathroom like instead of standing like
that like normal people it's not a bad
thing it's not even a weakness it's just
how that's food you literally have done
that since I've known you
all right let's lighten up the question
a little bit here okay if you had a
chance to become immortal would you want
to live forever watch all your loved
ones die and become lonely or live your
life out with them and give up being
immortal forever forever so you'd be
like the kid master super old maybe like
busy I think I can handle this question
uh this is a long answer though why did
you decide to make a pond in your
backyard gosh where do I even start at
all it actually all started because we
had a pool company come here a friend of
a friend said hey we know the best pool
builders and they were gonna come they
quoted us on this pool and the pool is
like very nice like I'm not gonna lie
this was like like the nicest pool it
had like the waterfall and like the
jumping rocks it was gonna be beautiful
right but the quote was so high it was
like how much 150 thousand dollars
somewhere around there
$150,000 for a pool we were just like
there's no like nah like we're not even
no we don't need a pool that bad so we
so we sat on we thought about that was
like two years three years ago basically
this year before we dug the pond we had
the same pool company come out like
let's get a new quote a much simpler
pool it was like it was totally
different it was like just like a square
rectangle pool it we got rid of the
waterfall it was like so simple but this
time the pool company knew who we were
and it was like they sent us this quote
how much was the quote for a less pool
thirty thousand more than the last like
the added on to it either inflation or
just our typical life story now is that
everybody charges us a lot more I'd
already been looking into the idea of a
pawn because it's bigger and we can we
can pull things on it we can jump things
and it's like it just opened up so much
plus I thought we could dig the pawn so
deep we could take all the dirt and
border the property because we have so
many people show up and film our kids
and it's just creepy and it's it's very
just our privacy is our home is our only
place so I was like let's take the dirt
and pile it around the property at least
add a little bit of privacy so we got a
pond and a little more privacy for a
fraction of the price the pond was like
a quarter it was not even a quarter of
the price of the pool and we got so much
use out of this pond so I mean the kids
love it so I'm glad we went the pond
that's really why we dug the pond it was
for fun and to add privacy to our life a
little bit that's gotta be burnt
who's y'all bundled out let's do it the
Christmas rush has been very crazy guys
obviously Sunday night so like orders
built up through the weekend but and the
the Christmas ornaments you guys
absolutely love sort of we we love them
so much we tried to get a last year it
fell through and so glad we got him this
year is it a full moon dude it's a super
moon tonight's the biggest moon of the
year I did that's the first thing I did
I looked out and saw the minim and I
knew it that split second you and I were
looking at the same moon at the same
time right guys I really cannot thank
you enough for hanging out with us
sticking around us through the bond the
exciting the boring BQ and everything
you're always here I can't thank you
enough for that we are gonna call it a
day and this is something crazy too I
rearranged my office a little bit today
so my desk is now on this side of the
room and
there's the door it's all backwards this
side completely destroyed the sides kind
of nice and clean some shine on that
side but since this streak continued
before we left for vacation I unplugged
my computer legit it's unplugged this
isn't for editing this is for gaming I
unplugged my computer because I was
playing so many games that I was missing
a lot of logs I would stay up playing
battlegrounds on that or I would I would
just want to play games and I missed a
lot of vlogs because of it so I have
unplugged my computers to this day it
has been
oh well we were on a trip so it doesn't
really count but that's gonna be so bad
why are you in Cain so scary today
oh he's scaring me in the store I just
heard you talking talking to myself
you think I'm in here talking to myself
maybe I have friends okay
I have friends we love you guys so so
much we will see you tomorrow thank you
for everything you are beautiful you've
got one of a kind you're beautiful
