good morning guys good morning I am not
even awake I'm a little bit of a zombie
right now I'm gonna jump on a boat do
some scuba diving so take a big breath
set your problems aside and enjoy some
beautiful music and some beautiful
underwater life
the craziest boat ride ever dude I doubt
it translates on camera but is it is
your star to capture these waves so the
dives canceled and we got to go in it's
a little bit too choppy it's not safe we
don't want to pop the morning we don't
want people being sick on the boat so we
guys just gotta come back
all right guys super super weird way to
start this vlog but we're turning the
boat literally just turned around right
now our down to the water is crazy ah
I've never seen sure the camera doesn't
show the waves but they're turning the
boat around the dive is canceled first
dude this has been our first tag
together he's certified now so he gets
the dive with me right yeah we're ready
lucky fish are happy you know happy so
all about that beautiful intro that I
was going to throw for you guys it's
cancelled today so we're headed back to
shore right now
yeah hey kid give you kitty
what's up Mon somebody okay so probably
one of the weirdest ways to start this
vlog kind of started as a failure but
just met up with Brit cause she's been
when was this report lakea Britney's
been won't become the portlet high and
the first thing I noticed is this giant
Christmas tree Christmas in the Bahamas
would be so strange to me because we
have it's cold yeah right check this guy
out massive beautiful Christmas tree and
a lot of you probably live where it's
always warm and if you do then Christmas
is so weird to us because we're used to
like either snow or at least being very
cold that just doesn't have the
Christmas vibe Smith's in the Bahamas so
while we were back there my parents came
over and they bought one of these
baskets from TIA
right here now Britt is getting one made
for allies are you just putting it right
in there right now putting your name on
there right now
you hand make all this oh dude said it
takes up to two months to make twelve of
these twelve of these baskets
pretty stinking amazing you know how
long it take me to make one then bad
I'll catch the whole place on fire
before I made a basket yeah getting a
bag for Liza that's cool and although we
have been to the Bahamas before she also
hand makes magnets so I'm gonna add a
magnet to our magnet board here handmade
which one Brett which one what's so on
I think country found what he likes
you gotta go inside to get the real deal
it's the Candyman oh hello very good are
you
you need a closet like this this is like
your this is what your tool box should
look like right there that's your tool
box tenten tenten tenten tenten tenten
tenten tenten country look out this is
like a really weird jump around vlog
right now but we've jumped back to the
resort it is going to store at least it
looks like it's going to storm I don't
know yeah shark teeth but there's like I
don't know it's just supposed to have
that tráfico blue look right now it's
like windy and the trees are blonde
which looks beautiful I have not eaten
today so I'm gonna grab some food and
we're just gonna hang out today I don't
I don't think it's going to be a crazy
adventure today I think we're just gonna
hang out goof off whoa clicking hey
flick it look at this entrance that's
that's nice just literally come down
your steps into the water it's amazing
yeah I think that's this curve yeah I
know but they call it curve here and
they pick it off the rock and they eat
the meat right out of the snail yeah I
think that's it we're just gonna hang
out today it's gonna be super what
why are you pushing me keep going
you go on you gotta hang out with you
guys stay very laid-back very chill I
was gonna make such a good scuba
sequence today I was shooting in 4k so
it's gonna be so nice maybe next time
we'll do it next time these shells are
so beautiful it's crazy they sell these
all over the beach but everytime we
snorkel dive they're just everywhere off
the ocean it's
so here's how it works they go out they
catch the shell they bring it up they
cook the meat and then they sell the
shell to the local tourists like us like
a rotating 360 of of profit
that's from falling in the cave that is
horrible
she's leg dude it's awful that's from we
went to the cave the other day we were
jumping in that hole that is from him
landing a little crooked that is
horrible dude you need some vitamins
that like to keep you from bruising so
out of nowhere a lot like Ohio it went
from looking like it was gonna storm
big-time too bright and sunny and blue
look at that it was like it just
happened what's up buddy how's your day
going
good did it not look like it was about
to storm and then BOOM sunshine lovely
sunshine
look at that now this is going to be a
beach fire man look how many pallets
that it look at these nails from the
last one dude look that is insane you
know they're making our little palette
fires in the backyard look tiny 3:48 if
you could just shrink down into a little
man be like Mavericks little people and
crazy surfing maverick waves just hiking

shallow you can walk so far knee-deep it
is crazy that you did you get down from

beautiful you're just kind of out here
like you stick out in the ocean right
here it's cool so I want to kind of come
out here and show you guys it's kind of
sad but during high tide the water
rushes up on these rocks fills in with
water and then all the birds can I just
scared all the birds away but all the
birds come up here and eat the fish that
are left in the holes it's just like the
harsh reality of life it's like you get
stuck in a hole hannover tteyuu it's
