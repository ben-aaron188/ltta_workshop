anniversary it was road trip it was just
getting home coming home to the family
and settling it Debbie had said we
wanted to jump in here jumping migraine
means Debian said we wanted to talk
about a little bit about our
relationship because it was our
anniversary and we want to talk about
the struggles of when we first got
together how many people doubted us not
just doubted us but like they had every
right to like I was I look like a bum
like long hair bandana you know I had a
work van that was the only vehicle I had
it was like I literally looked like the
worst person for her she was super young
I was way older than her and to your to
your family side like if it was Cora and
she brought home me I would be like oh
my god yeah you are not dating him so we
went through all of that guys I mean it
lasted a very long time for a very long
time I mean when when when you got
pregnant your mom put me in a headlock
yeah it was like started very rough like
we could not be separated but a lot of
people around us was like this is never
gonna happen I remember her crying
because people would call her and say
you need to break up with him he's not
the right guy for you this is this is
never gonna last like it's never gonna
last break up with him move on I know so
much - I don't think so I don't think
that was it I think like we were just so
like you couldn't not separate us we
were like seriously like a magnet like
right side of the magnet not the Sun
like pushes away with that we found some
pretty interesting photos some of our
first photos that we probably ever taken
together and this is like god I look so
young
look at this picture look at that we are
so young oh my gosh that is not me I got
more more than like my face is so clear
there what's going on like what is
happening to me I got stuck in my teeth

Noah oh my gosh look at my hair it's
crazy in that photo

today and I gotta be honest like we had
to come on here finish today's once that
we can start today's vlog it's super
weird but I've tried not to get backed
up try like get behind but it just
happened today so forgive us on that we
are trying our best here so that's the
photo of when we were at red white and
boom for the fourth of July member
that's what that isn't huh so it was in
July it's not like under that tree I'm
in the perfect spot basically I would
say like the perfect example of never
judge a book by it's cover because I
mean there's there's a kind I wish
grandma was here like I wish people were
here so I could just ask them what they
thought the stories are so funny well my
family knew you because you were friends
with Jason yeah no like not never gonna
happen
never gonna happen it was just no
denying it guys like we were truly I
believe meant to be together like this
girl was put on earth for me I I really
do believe that like I truly believe
that and I know she's thinking the same
thing vice versa all right yeah you just
know I'm telling you like ah it's crazy
so years went by and time passed and I
became accepted and and we just we just
started a life together and we started
we just did our thing and we worked very
hard and I had full-time job she had
full-time job and we started YouTube and
we we just did so much together we were
unseparable everything we did had to be
together I had to wait until I graduated
to move in with you yeah it was like
that day I graduated I walked got
everything moved in with you I remember
that night Marilyn was like I'll pay for
you to go to college
if you just stay here I'm like no bye
there was nothing separate like there
