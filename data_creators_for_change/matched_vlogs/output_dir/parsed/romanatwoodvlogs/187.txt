and I was like down and I don't know it
wasn't like I was a different person in
2012 I really was like the there was a
first time flying first class my mom
used her flyer malls that's so that we
could go on that plane and then you
still worked at the dental office you
were still working I was still had a
full-time job so crazy how much has
changed since then
I remember we gave the one guy rope that
climbed up the tree that's true the guy
that climbed up that tree for coconuts
we gave him rope in exchange for
coconuts because they they wanted rope
