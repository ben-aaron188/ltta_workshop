wanted to try and it was worth a try I
did have fun and enjoyed it so I can't
I'm not gonna say I messed up I had a
great time and that's what it was all
about me personally I had to mentally
just try this idea and I honestly told
me it was much different than what I

I think it was blown way out of
proportion or it's because we came back
from a big break so everyone was mad

feel does it feel to be out of there you
just came out of a baby it's solely
opposite of what actually happened I'm
just saying that and challenge for him
with a boy baby and a girl baby doing
anything I think baby child's would be
funny but I don't know if there's enough
of them you know what I mean like you
got to do you got to do real adult
challenges as babies I think would be
Bonnie so tell us if you guys have any
ideas baby challenges I think that's a
great video hilarious yeah but you do
things outside ride bikes skateboards
I can't skateboard while I win that one
that thinks so big you could be in like
a full like safety suit inside and you
would even know you're gonna have scuba
gear on and go in the water oh my you'd
have to have scoot you're on Lily
how would you shush you like your suit
man I think you look awesome oh right in
the head are you sleeping in
stormtrooper gear uh-huh just in case II
the enemy comes in fun with you today a
little man oh yeah you got a suit I
don't know what big Angry Birds suit
I've been bike wearing that baby costume
right it'd be big and bulky now you're
like slick and agile you know I got a
question I had a lot of questions today
the stormtrooper sir they wear the all
the gear right they wear all the
stormtrooper gear but they get hit with
one laser and they're dead so what's the
point of the gear like if the laser is
gonna get you with or without the gear
why wear the gear no but I like a plan
if you have 20 questions with you guys
there's so many questions there I don't
know gosh McCain we love you we love you
boy okay so I got another question and I
need your honest answer do you guys
really prefer the laid-back just me
filming with my vlog camera or Brit
filming with the camera more than me
going out of my way to try to make
entertainment like I want you I mean I
think I got the answer yesterday yeah
because here's the deal this is way
easier for me like I can easily do this
every day
and edit it so fast I can edit these so
fast yesterday's vlog took me hours and
hours and hours to edit this I can get
done like boom done
look so if you guys really prefer this
I'm set we can daily vlog it up all
right like this is easy for me mentally
always want to create something right so
I'm like I just I can't help it
it's Who I am
person I love trying to like I can daily
vlog it's easy right but it's hard for
me because I'm always trying to make it
better than it actually is I'm trying to
make my day better than it actually is
because I want to have fun and I want to
make it entertaining right that's that's
a trick of vlogging you've got to
entertain you whether you think that's
not true or not as a vlogger we have to
entertain you guys catch up on a couple
things good on fries good on hot dogs no
