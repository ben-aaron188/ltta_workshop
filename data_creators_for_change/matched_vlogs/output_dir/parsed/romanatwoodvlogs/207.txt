welcome to the blood guys I am stuck in
traffic downtown Columbus I've been up
here for a while I just want to say I've
been seeing a lot of comments about you
guys just so struggling to so much
struggle going on right now and I just
want to talk to you for a quick second I
see this all the time specially on
Twitter you guys are like I don't know
what to do with my life anymore I don't
know what to do and I just I see these
so much that I feel like it's time that
I just I'd say something about that and
this is this is coming from a past of
saying the same thing keep your mind
busy stay so busy that you have no time
to even think about how bad things are
keep yourself so busy occupied find
hobbies find things you love to do find
a company to start do more and you will
be so busy that you can't even think
about bad things and you're so busy I
gotta go do this I gotta go get this
done instead of sitting and being
depressed get on it get at it guys
welcome to the blog let's get this vlog
started I know I missed two days
apologies I just wanna get home I just
want to go home life is good baby smile
traffic tops dot-com this could be like
a today on traffic talks guys we're
gonna chat to you about positivity i I
just want you guys to know that mentally
you can probably come up with enough
positive thing no matter how many bad
things are going on which we all have
plenty of don't think that the guy you
look at over there is doing any better
than you aren't we all struggle you can
be successful it comes with a million
problems you can you can be rich it
comes with a million problems you can be
everything has like we all have problems
no matter no matter who we are and I
think like
when you see somebody and you judge them
you don't realize what they're going
through you gotta stop doing that first
of all but I'm not talking about that
I'm talking about seeing a lot of you
guys talk about how rough it is for you
right now I gotta say like it comes from
an old quote that I love is life has no
remote get up and change it yourself
like it is easy - it's way easier to be
negative like it's so much easier I can
see her and complain all day God I got
stuck and try I hate this is freaking
hot out there brother or I can be proud
that I'm alive that my eyes are open and
I am cruising in my car on this
beautiful sunny that it's easy to go
both ways much harder to be positive so
it truly is hard to be positive because
we have so many things weighing us down
every day that it just it's easy to get
in that trap so I challenge you guys we
used to do this all the time I challenge
you today right now and during traffic
talks to go positive do it for one hour
if you catch yourself being negative
just happen think positive think there's
got to be a positive way out of this
let's do it I challenge you right now
take the positivity challenge man just
one hour if you can make it an hour go
two hours when you find yourself
complaining flip it it's not hot out
it's beautiful it's about to be winner
and I'm gonna be complaining that it's
cold but there's snow like find a
positive way out of every situation I
know there's a lot of things that suck
all the time there's so many great
things man just just sitting on your
computer your phone right now enjoying
the vlog that you may or may not like

what happened to chase his head you're
gonna have to ask country into that one
apparently it's a four-hour story he
couldn't tell me in like the last pitch
I told you in one sing let me sleep or
give me a shot give me a shot oh oh
country you got some explaining to do
what the truth this has been my boy
since kindergarten you hurt my boy since
kindergarten it was total accident I was
trying to start many by too many by
and it was giving me an issue I would
never hurt him so low-volume he feels
bad he's in the whole moment and he came
to see well do you have the choke on huh
so you pulled the cord into his forehead
and I just my fist hit his head
literally that's good it's family show
so she's looking at him like what okay
what's up dirt boy could write your name
on your quad mile they argue about
chases head over there I just want to
say I missed you today so much no no I'm
on fire ate some salsa that we always
eat right but when I was done my mouth
just caught on fire they got the wrong
kind and show him Sean we're working on
the property look at this we laid all
new dirt down all right well actually I
wasn't a part of the dirt process but I
did lay all the straw during these days
off and then this is finally almost done
and everything's just coming along it
looks nice out here
okay so this is one of the biggest thing
now he's back here
now he's back here I'll make this really
quick so donkeys barn has been moved
it's been moved to a different part of
the property but now he never goes to
his barn ever even if it's storming he
doesn't go but now his barns move he's
back here look at him look at donkey
were you doing flash they go in love
push what do you got drop it oh I see
what's going on back here I see what's
going on back here you guys are getting
in the trash alright there no trash what
are they getting into nothing
what are you doing Dee huh that was all
under the barn yeah so we got more dirt
on the property perfect nose we'll throw
some grass seed down some straw look at
donkey acting like he still lives back
here so yeah
donkeys barns been moved to a closer to
the house and to the side so that during
the winter he'll be right with us which
is kind of cool plus we're getting
another donkey hopefully really really
soon so
be together and we'll have a bigger area
over there perfect we I know why are
they sort of get I feel like honestly
you can you could adopt a human faster
than a donkey why they so complicate you
probably don't know because I didn't
know the amount of things you have to do
to get a donkey is very very difficult
it is - we've done you got to fill out
resumes you got to give them like where
they're gonna live how they're gonna
live what their friends are what kind of
what kind of neighborhood you live in
for an adoption place you can go by
donkey anyway yeah but we won like I
wanted that kind of donkey that they had
and it's hard to get why are you calling
me out in front everybody well I guess
if you want the the donkey you want yeah
it's kind of complicated fine I take it
back it's the easiest thing to buy you
right now by those we're trying to
rescue donkey right you have to do that
it's all matter how much money you have
it doesn't matter anything they want
like forget about it but you don't have
to drive to Michigan to go pick it up
and you can't even pick it up you have
to go there first we take it out to pick
it out and then you have to go back
that's right donkeys calm half-price
