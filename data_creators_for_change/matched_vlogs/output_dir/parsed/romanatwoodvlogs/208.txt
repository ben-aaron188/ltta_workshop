mommy here goes mommy back to regular
home things like picking dad hats
placing orders for official smile more
dad hats cuz they we've never had them
on the store and it's it's tough because
you have different colors you have
different brands of hats these are all
different right material the everything
is a little different on each one you
got like this type of back you got
velcro back you got clipped back she got
there's velcro how do you pick this one
don't come in black oh yeah I like that
too but that's is that a dad hat though
