welcome to the vlog guys it is
absolutely beautiful when we're setting
up for the race of a lifetime you ready
he breaks you free re out on the track
what today it's Goblin verse GTR and
honestly I think I know who's gonna win
only because flash told me he gave me
six Empire told me everybody knows
what's gonna happen
this thing's wicked fast like so fast
that when we took off yesterday in
yesterday's vlog I was I was like wow
like it's so fast the only thing I will
say is it doesn't have the traction the
GTR has and we're going to 1/8 mile
track so everything's about the launch
you know I don't want to feel like I'm
ripping you off but that's okay and it's
a manual so I gotta like shit yeah auto
paddle shit I'm setting this up in the
Sun will be in my eyes it's almost like
the GTR is taking all the racing skills
out of the driver because it does
everything for you even launches for you
so yeah but today yes
dude you should you should do what you
do you know what I'm thinking though
like today's more about getting this on
the track then racing the GT but you
know what it's more about is we should
get Brittany and Mayer head-to-head yes
I love it there's one more race
happening today guys there is one more
race happening today country what's up
buddy
you ready you got you warmed up you
tuned it you you ready to you know last
time I hit that track and the Jag man
mom did I took a beating
so let's load it up let's load it up
she's going to the track today boys
whoo what was the corner what's 8 mile
time on this guy what fuck you guys well
Jack miles will check make sure she's
whew
I think you're good I think you're good
when I get on the track and if you guys
want to go for lunch break in time back
I'll probably just be finishing no we're
doing full-on best you guys are gonna do
it too in the comments what is the
eighth mile time on this guy she's got a
lot of horse I think we just tie it to
the side of the truck yeah I'll tie it
up two days in a row oh my god okay so
we're going to the drag strip gonna have
a lot of fun and Brittany's mom was like
Waukee Cora here
what'd you guys go cuz we're not gonna
be very long so we're getting it two
days in a row we get a little date time
no I'm so excited you're gonna take the
gt-r down there actually this guy from
direction first thing I do is get the
gas gutter some fuel they're thirsty
she's thirsty get nervous Matt getting
that you get nervous wait we have to pay
for gas in my own how do you put in this
thing
only the best 87 how about your rifle we
good how about this guy's going to see
your ID as possible itis that's a good
point actually it's nice and cool too so
for turbo cars but you things go in
who do you think's go in team teams mama
you team small one Britney's first time
at the track are you gonna go you're
gonna take the GTR down the track you
can go at your own pace it's called it's
called peace majors you take you make
the pace how we feelin that always
feeling you feelin fast you got that
cool air temperature air said make it
for sure this is gonna smoke you I think
it might actually she said Ron I know
you see a lot of fast cars at your track
you know you've got the best of the best
cars here but have you ever had somebody
roll down the track on one of these bad
boys actually yes and what kind of times
do they run an eighth mile can we clock
this unless you got it is like a
completely factory we did add the pond
cooler we added the pond coolant to it
it's okay let's let the games begin
sounds so fun let me just say how
awesome you guys look peel off you look
awesome man okay so Matt is obviously
we're gonna just test the car he's never
been at the strip before so just go at
his own pace get comfortable rods always
super helpful here and helps understand
the car and help him with uh you know
getting grip on the track and so that's
where he's at right now so they're gonna
go have some fun a couple times get used
to it then we're gonna floor it
here's my next car right here this is my
next car just kidding I would definitely
not do well in them
I feel like that's something you got to
do right there I've everything that I've
never been in anything that oh okay so
as Matt's testing his car I'm going to
run mine down a couple times I haven't
been here for a little while and Matt
just ran in the sevens he broke 100
miles per hour in the cloud now I'm not
I am not 100% sure but I do not think
I've ever broken 100 miles per hour in
the 8 miles - technically if that's true
he had just broke my speed which means
he would beat me so I got to run down
and see if I can bring 100 I just don't
remember
ninety-eight I just ran 98
that's yours faster than mine
holy smokes that is amazing Wow he was
hookin I just raced uh barber John going
down the track with me having some fun
in his new car that's so fun I did 98
I've done 99 seven for sure
but I don't know what I'm doing wrong
bro no wait wait how does that work
faster oh the speeds not so I had slower
speed but I broke the 8 mile faster yes
yeah wow I can't believe you broke 100
though that's insane
how'd it go keeping keeping the milk
supply oh she's literally out in the
truck in the back seat pumping milk it's
so crazy
mom life so when we when we started out
I watched Matt go down he broke 100 I
immediately thought holy crap his cars
faster than mine but not even thinking I
actually ran an eight mile faster than
him even though my time was slower that
was really confusing slower my speed was
slower I was faster he was slower yeah
which times all the matters times all
that matters crossing that finish line's
all that matters but I'm still trying to
figure out how you break a hundred and
go slower in the launch it's all in the
launch and I just got to get these two
wheels to hook up
he definitely has more this takes way
more skill level it's complete clutch
and shift my car pretty much does
everything for you plus it's all-wheel
drive so I feel like I kind of cheat
codes in like I have cheat codes
I'm gonna run manual this time and run
it all myself and see if that helps or
hurts me Toretto
yeah I'll take this side good luck so
we're doing kind of a test around here
I'm gonna run Manuel he wants to try
again so this is kind of like our first
warm-up race I'm sure if he beats me
it's gonna count so I want to try my
best
short ship maybe I redline so bad with
manual I'm so used to just going that I
didn't shift
I didn't shift shift and it cost me what
happened short ship I figured I let off
I I read line so bad yeah
yeah I'm so used to just auto all around
back stop
it's all these shifting it's a shifting
its course so fast but it's the shifting
man he's it's tough it's really hard I
don't have to do that
oh snap you beating that time he was
spinning I know yeah but he redlighted
he went to a Hareton is all that but
still even if he didn't I feel like she
was come so fast you guys are really
close on your time though
crazy I love it so far all right guys
Brittany is gonna join me on this one
I'm sure this chains in the way but Zeus
isn't leaving so he's gonna hang out
with us
yo Matt's car is fast it is fast it is
best car on the track
you gonna hold the cam I'll try it run
smack me in the face I love it
are you ready to whoop this boy you
ready know what this kid
I was very good so as we take a break
let the cars cool down I'm looking at
get your toy in our garage right there
dominates our right over the life you
gotta get the bumper sticker everything
this cars wicked fast like insane the
best parachute
cheese there we go pop a wheelie time
baby that's it let's see it
what's that feel like inside oh you're
just looking at the clouds so earlier
today I mentioned the race of the
century you guys probably thought it was
me and Matt but what I was really
talking about was country's bike versus
what do you want to race here John you
got his helmet he's got his helmet
safety is always number one priority yes
sir
all right them saying going down who's
going down you want to take me on
something I did bring something I could
take you on the track with my razor
scooter think you can handle it
tamadate oh right now let's go this is a
pretty fast leg I may just get off and
run man vs. machine is doing all right
man how you feeling feeling good feeling
fast can't even see you you'll feel that
do i I don't know
I'm racing on scooter me hot sweaty
these two girls are so what's your name
Zoey and Zoey Zoey and they both rock in
small motors they just come running up
out of this corn come watch come watch
you ain't ready for this bike yeah the
clutch is bad come on man I think the
clutch is officially gone it's not
moving and you go
okay here we gotta make it go full speed
full speed that's full speed yeah I
think she's finally broke dude
full throttle full throttle alright we
may face rods going he's like I'm in
y'all fill me fill me it won't go
yo you just got roasted and she yeah we
might have to retire a little friend
here
I'd love to step it up I think it's
tough one upgrade
so here's we're at the card basically
has a launch sequence and it's it
doesn't have a clutch you can't do
anything with the car if it won't allow
you to be in launch sequence right now
I'm locked out it has computers it's
like it's like scientific stuff so right
now because I've went down so many times
it's saying that basically I can't
launch it anymore and we've been letting
it cool now I got the hood popped and
hopefully by the way I don't know if
I've ever showed you guys actual motor
on this thing look at this hand-built
GTRs are still hand though at least the
motors parts of them so it's pretty cool
so yeah I'm locked out of my own car
this thing has launch control and as
grocery control right now it's in
grocery mode right now you can just go
get groceries in it and that's what it
is until it cools down I can't do
anything alright we've waited it out we
gotta go unfortunately my car will not
allow me to race anymore it literally
shuts you out of racing so I've been
waiting we've been letting it cool and
dude your car's freakin wicked man I
don't know I don't know what we call
this today I got the fastest time you
got the fastest speed I don't know
that's crazy so technically technically
I think we both agree that neither one
of us had a solid run like each time
we'd run I'd have a problem or he'd have
a problem so I don't know they're pretty
darn equal I'd say they're pretty darn
equal I'm gonna vlog that because right
now technically the GTR has the fastest
time down the track today Matt this is
your chance to beat my time if he beats
it more if he beats this time you beat
the GTR period but either way you and I
have the fastest street-legal cars here
today for sure no one else is close no
one else was freely Oh actually I'm so
impressed with this thing I cannot
believe how fast it is honestly it's
blazing fast right
this could actually this could be bad
for me if Matt beats my time and I'm a
loser today which is fine but I'm
confident the GDR is gonna hold that
number for me do you think he's gonna be
me he's gonna run with Billy 15 which is
a beat
that right there puts the GTR number one
I think seven one I know I know that
look I know that face cuz there was my
face a few times he won't go again yeah
I heard it
come on little Goblin come on little
Goblin Matt's so determined to beat that
GTR I think if he could launch right he
might be able to do it this is it this
is last run see if he can break a seven
point one that's what I ran
come on you blurry 7.4 no big deal looks
like looks like I get to go home with
the trophy today even though my car
won't even job but I just wanna let you
know that you're looking at a winner oh
yeah I took it today barely but I took
it he just did a seven four thousand
seven one that's three hundreds of a
second or something like that here he
goes again
Oh baby
oh I missed it missed it hey mayor good
until malmö going to a victory lap real
quick see you guys all credit is due
though man that car is wicked fast like
I just can't get over it it's okay guys
cruising and back home I hope you
enjoyed whatever we just did at the
racetrack going home I think my mom and
dad are coming over and we're hanging
out and comfit off I don't know exactly
what we're doing but I got a little bit
of drives
well it's dang shame she's gonna have to
leave here in the next six months I was
just getting used to having her oh she's
gonna do what we gonna do with your bike
we return her back to her original state
just walk it off country walk it off we
need two trumpets plan his it for all
four all red she didn't run good today
but we're gonna be we gotta find a tuner
we gotta get a tune job on it you know
she still run can't kill her on a boat
light it on fire push it out in Oh it's
