many weird things showing up here today
guys welcome to the vlog we're at
production it's the day of the big
project X prod when your name for this
mic what's the name of this stuff what
are we doing I don't know okay I like
that I was talking about the project in
general but today is jet board flash you
ready for your big shoot honey how'd you
know I was ordering pizza yeah so we're
out here today working on the question
mark project that we've been working on
for a while so weird and I'm and
explained why but we've got Andy from
Jay Andy Andy he can't hear me but we've
got the coolest toy ever today for this
pond our own man
not long we've now I cannot believe you
have one of these I what's not mine
first of all it will be I've no idea
no you're gonna make it happen let's
make it happen I'm gonna show you guys
what we got day and honestly I think our
areas a little small for it but here it
is I wonder why you were answering me
it's Adam guys it's Adam so sorry Adam
Adam brought us the coolest toy ever and
I'm gonna let him explain exactly how
this thing works good man
what is this this is the jet surf GP 190
CCS goes about 34 to 37 miles per hour
it's amazing which probably feels like a
rocket yes on water you are cruising oh
my it looks it looks above my level of
knowledge but it looks fun to plan I
know that's a weedeater engine the gas
tank the electrical just a simple board
yeah just a simple the posting device
were good okay so um I figured anybody
that has one of these or has never rode
one they can they can ride them in lakes
they can ride him in oceans but I
thought what would be funny is to try to
do it my little mini Lake which is
probably too small and
see we will see I think you can do it no
problem normally yes you need a big body
of water but I have faith in you
yeah and we'll see what happens
definitely you want me to the Sparta
kick you owe me double kick drop kick
here we go
all right before we get too started here
I come in check out hey where are you
going I got the magic touch look like
she was about to smile on camera she was
about to get caught smiling no no Britt
how do you know which one's ours and
which ones oh my gosh guys we don't even
know if tuxes tux anymore that's talks
and that's edo edo tuxedo so funny
hey guys veronica is getting rid of the
rest of her cats and somebody here as
smart wanted one of our cats so they
brought an extra cat it's not our cat we
still have two cats and that's it I
think is that one ours what you need to
know how to take this thing about well
at least you're not talking about the
GTR we've got a big delivery coming
today so they're helping with the garage
and country yes you're gonna be able to
handle this it's going downstairs we are
gonna use this treadmill once and for
all
okay so pretty much every angle every
part of this house there's something
going on different crews different teams
you know I told you yesterday we're
gonna get back into the craziness and
then last week you've been kind of a
week off so here we go let's do this
people everywhere he's gonna give us a
little test run for you think you're
gonna do this oh yes you are
I want to see you spend I'm gonna fail
because fails are fun fails are formed
AF I think honestly my viewers like
fails but they do like to see me succeed
sometimes that's why the ones who like
me like me that's all I am I'm a factory
of fail yeah we did you should get them
as electric fish we imported all this
water dolphin sanctuary
no I want a sugary drink
did we wanted to do this for so long
right alright dude the thing starts by
itself it's not even it's thinking it's
from the future like john said it's the
batmobile of the water yeah I guess
that's the batboat there is no idle so
you always have to give it gas it's
always moving forward though yeah
exactly
just watch that dog over there I'm
aiming for the trampoline because at
least it's somewhat soft on the blob I'm
so worried yes look at this thing's the
coolest thing ever
okay I need it
oh ma that's pretty amazing dude you're
right it'll fit really nice in my garage
by the way yes I'm so excited yeah you
wrecked twice which makes me know that
I'm going Iraq which is fine

been asking for the moment you've been
waiting for it is time you're gonna take
this vlog camera and you're gonna blow
everybody's minds with his camera skills

practicing this like I see him like late
at night he'll be out here just like
fake holding the camera just like it's

San Diego if I come your way we are
going into the ocean like these babies I
don't want to trick it and put like a
raft like this on top so it looks like

you there he's got it what he makes it
look so easy I know what I want for my
birthday actually Christmas is sooner so
you can just make sure Santa has that
hockey out here you don't try it you
could do it it's not that hard
no with wheels you're terrible this does
them wheels as a motor
ah you wearing a hat you keeping a
head on maybe I shouldn't wear the hat I
lost mine like 10 times country imagine
how many babies you could rescue with
that thing you'd be baby after baby
let's see it Gilly Gil that is the worst
timing the worst time yeah
okay so not only does it run on gas but
has a giant lithium-ion battery which
has been running all day so it just died
as soon as chase went to give it a shot
that's what you get for being part of
the camera crew not the fun crew it's a
sacrifice
I'll get you on that board one way or
another hey can we just put a rope on
the front I'll pull him across
oh man you you've stirred up the Beehive
now see you brought your toy now look

tux don't like the camera camera shy
that's the double trouble right there
devil talks talks we are hanging out
we're actually that thing wore my legs
out I cannot explain what kind of feel
at the way I was sitting on the board I
was just putting all my weight on my
upper thighs no africana
I'm not used to having a bunch of wild
hyenas in my living room
all right guys speaking of new stuff
coming in and speaking of luring cameras
I have been using this same camera just
wanna sit in the kitchen a because it's
quiet hey watch your animals both side
my sneak out here with you boy real fast
ah
I usually don't vlog these kind of
things because it's really relevant
maybe a lot of you guys are starting to
vlog you want a vlog channel and I've
always used I feel like I feel like I'm
still one of the very rare vloggers that
only use a little camera I use the g7x
and most vloggers now are using DSLRs
and and Joby tripods and external mics
and I'm still running just this little
camera actually my show you
I still use this little guy it's just a
little handheld camera and most
youtubers I think at this point are
using being really big cameras there's
many reasons I actually still use this
camera one of the biggest reasons is its
small enough that I can put it in my
pocket I can beat it up because I go
through cameras really fast guys and
this is actually an affordable camera as
far as vlogging goes it's affordable
although it is still expensive with my
environment and the things that I do I
break cameras all the time I go through
these cameras so fast so I've always
just kept this camera I don't know as
they break I get a new one but now today
we're trying something new
hopefully you guys will like hopefully
the sony 6500 i I'm actually using this
current camera this sony for the big
project I'm working on so I actually do
it's really weird it's hard to explain
but I actually do another vlog for this
big project that I shoot with and I'm
shooting with this camera because it
does 4k so the project you guys are
eventually gonna see is gonna have me
vlogging other things with this camera
right here no no no I started to like it
and I was like well maybe I try it for
my vlogs so that's where we're at maybe
I will just start using it tomorrow and
give it a shot see if it makes a
difference see if you guys even notice
it does not have a flip up screen which
I don't use that much I do you I've it
up right now actually but I don't need
it like I've been vlogging long enough
that I can I can I can hit the shot if I
need to hit the shot so
what is this thang is that okay no that
is a little tense
I got a new camera for videos so cool so
cool I'm gonna throw you in the pond
it's so cool
you stole my bubble wrap you guys yes
yeah you can let's go
so yeah yeah starting tomorrow I will
try this new camera see if you guys like
it definitely not a pocket cam it's a
lot to carry around maybe probably makes
it that much better

the last vloggers

duplicated boom you don't get your blue
