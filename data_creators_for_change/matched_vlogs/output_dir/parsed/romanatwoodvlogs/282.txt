okay so we are back home and we're doing
something I think is really cool maybe
not too relatable to your situation but
you can do this for any situation you
are in and these are affirmations
affirmations can be used for like
anything like you can hang up a sign you
print off the internet you could write
on a piece of paper like it can be
trying to stay positive you can hang
things in your room like smile more or
think positive or anything you want
Brittney's right now are about having
this baby so she has like relax breathe
open this one says a lot like imagine
you're in the moment I trust birth that
is like just gonna have this baby and
it's gonna happen exactly the way it's
supposed to happen is let's see these
simple reminders that can help you get
through whatever it is you're going
through you could you can you you could
do this for anything you're going
through in life you could put these
reminders all over your house you can
put them in your room you could you
could you can use little words to just
lift yourself up or get you through the
next couple hours or the whole day or
whatever it is you can do this yourself
now we Brittany did a bunch of these at
her baby shower where basically the
girls took turns like coloring them or
making them a little nicer or you know
this will not last forever that's for
the heat of the moment right there
that's when the that's when the going
gets tough right they're like imagine
you hang this up and it's beside your
bed and every morning you wake up
believe you can and you will these are
just great thoughts and reminders that
you're not gonna wake up and think about
by yourself but if that was hanging up
on your wall right when you woke up
really I can
yes let's do it who uh who did this one
that's that's a little psychotic no it's
a little like slow down calm down don't
worry don't hurry trust the process I
really like that one and I don't know if
I will be able to read it well I mean I
can read it to you a baby is coming it's
coming I tell ya that one's nice
who did this on that sweet I don't know
I like how they edit hurts you hmm
Jane's doing a little doodling sparkle
sparkle Wow look at that stuff I'm
supposed to be coloring but I'm using
these to inspire you guys you can and
you will I could go for so many my
zoomed in that's what's going on this
Karen we always do it
I also soon went out for life you guys
you guys may have actually spotted
things like this around our house maybe
in the back of the vlogs randomly all
over the inside of our cupboards and
inside these were actually there when we
moved into this house and we loved them
and we've never touched them they're all
over the house you guys the price
spotted things like it but simple
messages that just catch you off guard
and remind you every day of the normal
things that should it push you and push
you forward it's genius like put these
things all over the place I uh I made
bring me a little son right here is
little sunshine see cuz you want
sunshine alright so I'm going to use
this moment right now to make you make
one of these for yourself and hang it in
your room and tweet me a picture send me
a picture of what it is it's gonna help
you move forward and just push through
your days it can be something so simple
like keep going or don't give up or you
could look something up online like an
inspiring message affirmations for
that's true I challenge you maybe your
family all together you guys can make
one together put it in your living room
frame it just a nice reminder to you to
everybody that like these are just
simple words you don't think about like
smile more it's like something you don't
really think about but when you see it
you're like at least for me I'm like I
will now try I'm really gonna work hard
so I don't know it's kind of swine this
is for the this is for the moment right
here she's almost here
so when you're in that there's
struggling stages just remember she's
almost a kindergarten class you know
we're like all the kids hung up their
drawings they're you know I mean these
are these are important I'm just saying
like it reminds me of that you know no I
girl I thought they were wet just for a
second imagine surrounding yourself with
nothing but positive thoughts nothing
every time you look you're reminded of
something positive it does start to make
you think better and be positive and I
can do this I can do it look at this
like these reminders I mean you don't
have to have this many hanging up but I
don't know I know you've been doing your
research about having the baby but the
most important part and I do not want
you to forget this all right
never allow diving into this pool all
right you are not to dive in this pool
that says never ever
then in the blog last night hoping and
praying that our baby girl would come
last night and I would film that it
didn't she didn't come she's still in
Brittany's belly so we're just waiting
we're we're just it's a waiting game
I'll be honest Brittany thought we were
gonna have her two days ago and then she
could have swore we were gonna have her
yesterday and I'm hanging you love these
carrots huh
whoa we could swear the baby was coming
like we're so excited and Britt's still
convinced that like any time but uh so
basically I'm on here saying that baby
didn't come last night she's still
