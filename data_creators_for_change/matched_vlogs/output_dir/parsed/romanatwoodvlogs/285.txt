starting today's vlog exactly where we
left off yesterday we did a current day
update vlog and I'll see you soon okay
Nancy later I don't mean a while it
about destiny let me have you on the
side I know I can't wait to hug you
straight on like we have to go look
watch this is where we would hit boom
just a huggie something you ladies have
fun now keep it keep it dry what the
heck why is it so where it's so holy it
is yeah I've seen a bit don't worry
about us we love ya alright boys
it's just up hey mommy's gone you know
what that means
do you know what that means that means
we can do whatever we want
yo we got the house it's all ours I got
an idea
don't you want you wanna do it I'll show
you yeah I can along this this it's
going to be our dumbest idea ever
alright first of all guys hope you're
having an awesome day and it's been
raining literally consistently all day
through the night we lost if you watch
yesterday's vlog our tent was completely
destroyed and and honestly it just won't
quit raining it's crazy the pool is
going to be over for hon okay here's my
idea guys this is right pretty dumb
first of all have you seen I got this
crazy little thing toolbox with no tools
in it yet what country has its own
drawer check this out oh can you take it
now look at country straw
boom anyways here's my idea we have this
gigantic roll of bubble wrap that
production left here at my house and I
was just thinking like mom's gone
Britney's gone like everyone's leaving
so me and the boys could do like boy
this is voice bubble wrap like boys love
bubble wrap so my thought is maybe we
take it inside and do the whole house
or at least the whole role inside this
is getting the biggest lightest object
haha
okay so this right here is my idea
bubble wrap in the house like we unroll
it cut it unroll it cut it cut it cut it
you want to well how much of the house
could we do i I don't think it's as much
as it look I mean that's a big role but
alright bring it on in bring it on and
you can't tell Brittany about this it's
a secret it's a secret I'm up throw your
phone out yeah you got it
oh geez oh I already bought one come on
flash push push miss oh thank you hang
on hang on back it out back it out there
we go yeah do it it looks bigger than
the house I thought it would be that's a
lot that's a lot of bubble wrap what do
you have to do it disappeared I saw oh
that's great oh there's give me the most
annoying look like a quitter
I think we have enough to do we probably
can do this whole I think we should
start in that corner and just work our
way down and cut it pull it pull it pull
it pull it pull it through this whole
area and pull it down pull it down to
Chinatown old man oh my god
and they're sure
I'm looking Cain realizes we're trapping
him in there okay you try it you're
trapped is bubble City bubble rat city
here's this it's like the best home
security right there you pick that you
put that around every door and you would
hear somebody coming in try to come over
your might be light enough you can creep
over it yeah I try oh ok so we're more
in the quality Taji see oh jeez okay
maybe we keep some walking pass here we
got the floor looking pretty good
Wow just a 10 you're gonna stand back
he's tanking back all right
you can't pop it oh can you imagine if
Britney receive it ya ready yep
oh you got a roll you can't pop any oh
you got to do a gentle gentle giant nice
nice hey you got it oh please if you
actually do it and Britney can't get mad
at me okay if her mom does it how could
she get mad at me I'm just just a fun
guy and she just deal with it honey I
guess or anything
yep but you have to get the cane you
have to get the cane without popping any
oh sure how it's done sure oh yay I hope
nobody you're wearing headphones you
mate may we switch the ball you down a
little bit
what's the right afternoon keep on
towards your chair

way he can get there without popping any
see he's figured out a method he's
evolved he's figured it out

under it you got to stay above it's
impossible you just got to go actually
