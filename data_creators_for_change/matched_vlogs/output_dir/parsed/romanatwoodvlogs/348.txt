sunshine heat water look at this cold
flow to you dude it's awesome
is it just me or is like Easter like are
they turning Easter and even we're
guilty of it we're preparing Easter like
into Christmas or you like fine gifts
instead of like a cute little basket
with like candies in it that's what my
sister was I don't like giving them
candy because they make you go crazy
that's all they want for breakfast I
will eat your book and something else an
Easter book like what Easter is really
about IRA celebrates only needs to match
so you're worse than the kids they can't
you don't want them to have it but you
want to buy the whole friggin right we
can get baby's first pink handyman
toolsets she'd be like daddy fix
everything properly he's not going to
need fallout with the dad like we all
know you're lying okay seriously though
I do need it I do need some tools for
myself baby I need some honey some
vessels
I need a new tape measure can you stole
mine I can't find it okay just in case
you get me a basket this year for you to
just get a belt filler for all the stuff
super glue for the stupid white things
sit on top of our porch but I feel like
it's not just super glue if you're
looking up like a plastic super glue you
just described super glue perfectly yes
which one would earn it's not wood baby
I feel like the world is designing
things for guys like me that don't know
what they're doing everything stickable
now oh you need something hung just
stick it to the wall no screws no tools
necessary that attracts me that is like
me right there but then the things fall
off the wall because you hang stuff too
heavy turn your wallpaper your paint
everything that
maybe I'm not even capable of
understanding how these work okay so
usually the grand-prize Easter hunt is a
golden egg look at these golden eggs
period three bucks apiece
who would do that
you got to mount the bunny the golden
bunny here on our wall just a second
question what is going in they're going
to say this is like a ostrich
