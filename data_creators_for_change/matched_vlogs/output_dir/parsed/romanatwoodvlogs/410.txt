avenues right now between vocal and just
looking for my dog just a bunch of
boring crap that's like I know everybody

extremely busy all the time that didn't
have something to do so busy good
problem oh we keep your mind busy too if
you're going through problems if you're
struggling with saying maybe you're with
whether it's coal maybe it's a
relationship maybe it's your career keep
your mind busy stay busy don't give
yourself time to think about the
negative things don't even give yourself
time to worry I said it's all time
worrying doesn't change the outcome keep
you so very busy at all times but it's
something that I try to do all not
everything's rosy all the time like
we're humans and we battle things every
day some of us are
they're struggling with jobs I'm
struggling with relationships in school
and whatever it might be we're all in
this together man we got to team up we
got to work together and that's why I
use my videos to try to lift you guys I
try to lift you up and push you whether
it works or not
I'm trying we're all stuck for this
planet together like there's no leaving
we're here together let's work as a team
and so Brittany is back home I'm going
to shoot straight to her out her and
Kane and mall mall we're gonna do some
stuff though okay so kind of a small
change of plans instead of cleaning

bathtub and I was like well we cut your
hair real quick and he's playing with

see yeah not fun buddies white but we
can make from study by just adding
sprinkles to it so all right this is the
only you're good Kane you're so cute how
do you like your hair though a little
long it could have probably cut some
more off not a hundred person if I'm in
love with your hair okay since we don't
have the fun buddy mix we're going to
make our own so we need to find
sprinkles why can a lot of sprinkles up
there you like these these are the two
different ones those make more colorful
one dump some sprinkles in there
there you go
so yes you didn't know that the
difference between just like white meat
