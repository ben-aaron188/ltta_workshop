I'm gonna show you a few characters and
characters are pretty awesome
obviously there's Kane and his monster
truck let me turn this down little Brit
and then everybody has different like
outfits and then you unlock different
levels of characters but there's so many
characters in this game he's supposed to
come with the shovel
they always getting a shovel in the next
build because the whole dig of the whole
thing so this is napalm rum and because
of the flamethrower he actually shoots
flames
there's Noah and you can see a
skateboard right there and I don't want
to show you all the characters but
there's so many funny ones they all do
different things they all wear different
stuff it's John so yeah guys it's our
first game ever on iTunes and the App
Store's and I'm just so excited to get
it out to you guys and see you guys
playing it and sharing it it's fun like
it's a fun game so yeah let's get this
actual vlog started this is not the
beginning of the vlog I'm actually shot
this towards the end of the vlog but
Britney had a dentist thing which we
should just warp into right now all
right how you feeling you're all good no
you're actually looking really normal is
your eye doing anything funny yet okay
you're gonna be here for a while so I'll
see you a little bit I love you
ah it is so nasty out wow it is really
feeling like falling man like cold
October weather so I got some time to
kill I've never driven this car by the
way last night actually last night
Brittany went and got all the paperwork
done for this car this car now belongs
to Brittany she fell in love with this
there was no talking about it like she
really fell in love with it I'll give
you advice don't test drive a vehicle
unless you plan to buy the vehicle
because you're gonna fall for it that's
that's that's what's gonna happen that
all being said I'm gonna head up to the
studio and try to come up with some
ridiculous challenge for you guys I
guess the challenge would be for me well
it's a challenge for both of us but in
the end I think it's me that has to do
the worst stuff I think we should black
it all out like all black get rid of the
chrome no chrome like shade that right I
don't know if Britney wants to do that
but I think it would look awesome all
black ding dong all right so since today
is the launch of my very first game I
thought it would be appropriate to come
in and show you it when I come up to
Columbus we're here at reiner studio
this is these are the guys building the
game right here what's up don't be shy
yo they've all been in the vlog before
but these are the creators of the game
right here I love that it's not like we
had this design somewhere like it's
right here in here so I want to show you
guys maybe some like behind the scenes
some goofy stuff maybe the beginning
stages of the game because I think it's
hilarious and it's kind of weird because
you probably haven't even played the
game yet so it's not gonna make a lot of
sense to you play the game that's
awesome and what is this like testing
the blades actually yeah we were trying
to test the I love that be funny oh yeah
so what would you call this like an
error no actually what they're gonna be
getting in the final testing dude I love
that that looked really good so
obviously these guys have had quite the
journey
this game from where it came from to
where it is now I've been just mind
blown how well they've done this and I
love that you can turn the gore on and
off that is such a huge huge perk to me
because a lot of new games don't have a
lot of options you guys put a ton of
options in this which that's great my
mom's really pumped about your mom's
really excited so you can see all the
little technical things behind the
scenes these are all what makes him work
and run and be able to do it do
everything so oh here we go that's one
of the sketches right there dancer guy
that never made it in maybe maybe he'll
make it he's got time yeah he's good
time
I think everyone's favorite one of their
favorite characters in this entire game
is Cain because he is right in the RC
truck like a boss like he's got it and
when he gets caught when he get when he
drinks the coffee the flames block back
only works live in the game this is a
little mess that's all right that's
right
so that's Noah and he does his specialty
is a kick kick trick and in the game it
looks right one of the coolest parts is
just that we're all in the game even
Carl's in the game dude and your
characters on a hoverboard no what is
your favorite trap or when you die to
most you know what I the big scissors
get me so much but the stapler is my
favorite all right I tell you that we
will do this is how we put the traps
together so build every single piece
there all we already have every trap set
up over here and how they work so if I
hit play right now you can see this all
right working but what we do is we set
up these sections from start to finish
and we set up how we want them to look
how deadly you want them to be we also
convince it we can pretty much go it
through here scale rotate and build
anything we want to it's it's random
that it spawned so every time you play
the game it's a different it's different
you want to have I only have this
meganlocke
you know flame our dude I know I know
it's this build so what well basically
you'll see here is this trap is gonna
spawn over and over again they got iam
role for you to just test it over and
over and over so and then if I'm like oh
I want to bring you guys along a little
behind the scenes show you how just
detail how much work he's gone into this
game it's very cool to just see it being
built and seeing all the different
levels and and the high school right now
on the newest build is what 22 level 22
yeah I don't know 23 22 kepler-22 yeah
it's not Carl we already know we've been
talking about how fast you guys will be
that - please send your screenshots when
you get up and the real reason I came up
here is because we've been trying to
think of a challenge that we have to do
if you guys get this number one number
one on the iTunes Store more it could be
Google Play - right it's for Android
it's for everything uploaded yes we'll
look at this so what do we have to do
that's the real thing I want to do
something huge if you guys get this
number one this is deserving of
something huge dude what if they
actually got in the game like put like
as a character that would be amazing
how many five people and will make their
character will sketch them out maybe
they have ideas too so yeah this is a
work in progress I absolutely love it so
much awesome maybe like five of you will
be in the game that I love that I make
you imagine as a kid like winning that
and hope I can't it's like I believe
about
to our day so we could win a chance to
be a pac-man okay so that's that's our
initial I think we can add to this but
for now that is amazing I don't know how
we'll pick them but five of you if we
hit number one Google Play iTunes either
one any planning I think maybe we could
even do something we got top ten because
that's pretty amazing that's amazing
eternal blessing and it's free so you'll
be in the free category which is also
the hardest category to get to the top
because there's so many yeah you want to
be the biggest in the world that's true
we gotta hold some sort of live
competition projector iPads on the like
board and then they're just yeah maybe
that's it maybe you get the cover before
you get to do a backup board date with
Karl
what if I shave your head all right guys
I gotta go get Britt see me bye bye
yes good job everybody yeah okay mumbled
goes well done with your dentist um
sorry I just ate a piece of chocolate
let's go get Brittany why do I miss this
girl so much if I'm away from Brittany
is gonna sound so bad if I'm away from
Brit for the littlest time I literally
miss her so much
it's insane like it's always crazy to me
that I'm building something like a game
for you guys behind the scenes without
you ever knowing why like I'm downtown
Columbus all the time and I never tell
you guys why I hate it it's so hard but
I'm always excited to release they oh I
don't know if he has my dress I'm gonna
