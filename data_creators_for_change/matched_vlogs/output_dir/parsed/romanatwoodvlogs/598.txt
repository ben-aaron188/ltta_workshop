be recycled and they are shipping them
out and I'm not gonna have them anymore
so it is my last day with all of these
tubes before they go they asked me Scott
to free asked me can you show your
viewers how many - how many toilet paper
tubes the state of Ohio the whole state
uses in just 30 seconds do you know how
many that is I asked them I didn't know
45 I'm serious
forty-five thousand tubes in 30 seconds
in just the state of Ohio it's just
great it's crazy to me I I just can't
get over it you guys know me pretty well
and I'm always up for the challenge so
yeah I got my buddy Spence here we're
building a pullout back and we're gonna
house the Pope you know normally on a
nice hot summer day like this we'd fill
this with water right yeah it's
typically how did our my buddy Spence
you may remember Spence he actually has
helped us out with several videos the
one where I filled my house with snow he
was here helping with so many things
when the Dudesons was here he brought a
bunch of cool stuff for us this that
snow blower actually and I guess a new
one to add to our list the swimming pool
full of toilet paper tubes who's ever
nobody's done that
ever I don't think maybe maybe somebody
oh this is a good way to remember Spence
he's the one that caught my jumper
cables on fire all right man if you're
ready I'm ready we just want to carry
these you got all the muscles do don't
go here's the first box

give a serious shout out to Scott to
free for letting me have so much fun
during this partnership to be honest
with you I'm gonna actually miss having
these things around now we've done
everything from Phil a Jeep I filled the
fridge we filled a whole pool we've
flown through a garage door with a brand
new BMW into these things we've had a
lot of fun so huge shout out huge thank
you to Scott to free man I'm really
actually gonna miss this I got to show
you what this is all about I haven't
done it on our entire part like I don't
know how many videos I've done I've
never showed you guys this so here it is
and this is cool and this is what this
is all about guys check it out you know
what this is came to bliss toilet paper
dude I'm not kidding there's no tubes
that probably makes no sense to you
but we've always had tubes in our toilet
paper and then we unroll it and then we
throw the tube away this is it right
here Scott
tube free that's what I've been saying
to free Scott - free there's no more
tubes it's awesome
removing the cardboard tube to make it
easy for people to make an impact man I
mean it is a big impact think about how
many of these tubes we put out there
it's crazy so they're shipping them off
they're recycling all the tubes and it
is goodbye for the tubes man it's been
fun except for when you put them in the
refrigerator wasn't fun I cleaned it
whatever I cleaned it up it was so you'd
have to do anything it's just funny as
always guys I'll put the links in the
description click on them check it out
you can learn more about the products
you can learn more about what they're
doing for the environment and you cannot
use a coupon on there for you to so
check it out you have to clean this
whole mess up
it's almost a shame the truck comes
tomorrow to pick all this up which means
the only reason I hate that is because I
have to clean it all now dang that looks
like so much fun we didn't put the liner
in the pool so we're lucky we'd have a
leak but now we are ready Kane has been
so patient and it is here I promised him
