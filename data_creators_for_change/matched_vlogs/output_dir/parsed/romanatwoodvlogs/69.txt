welcome to the blog guys we have some
exciting that's not what it is careful
easy row we got it we need that we're
gonna have to we need that here we're
gonna chop it right here right this
whole roll of paper Brian we need your
body cuz now's not the time put it down
oh yeah these are cardboard they're not
actually using the flagpole I love it
just want to beat them up though they
dig the weatherman real quick look at
this Oh when's he gonna stop I'm ready
for summer I'm ready for sunshine put it
in the hole first try ready set go
you got a run into it run into it here's
what we got going on we have these two
tripod stands I mean you should have a
pole that ran across the top of it so
that our piece of paper could go on and
slide down so we can do photos but we've
lost the pole the pole is gone so we are
making what well here's we have this old
you know the flagpole on top of the
tower
this was leftover pipe from that
flagpole so we're gonna cut new holes
here in there but our flagpole is too
short for a roll of paper so we have to
cut the roll of paper like this oh my
god you're using that what is that thing
just BAM put a helmet on yeah dude when
I said helmet I just met mullet that's
the safest thing you can put on as way
safer than helmet got a big a big red
okay go ahead and cut it doing cut it
I'm uh you got this
this is just like cutting wood papers a
byproduct woods so it's just wood boom
now the kids can use this as drawing
paper just roll it out and color that
too like it's hair this is permanent I
think you should make it permanent oh my
it's like perfect
look at that how much paper we didn't
have to call I'm not gonna lie that's
nice that might be better than the port
came with honestly that's that's meant
to be along the pole the more bow you
know watch out that that pole bow this
guy it's gonna be full-on snow again
