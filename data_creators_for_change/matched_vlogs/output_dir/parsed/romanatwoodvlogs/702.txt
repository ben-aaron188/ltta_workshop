can are you comfy hey guys welcome to
our house welcome to the vlogs before we
get started today
Oh before we get started today we want
to do something a little interesting and
I want you guys to do it with us every
day write down three things you are
grateful for
boom boom three weeks so right now
either privately or in the comment
section list three things that you are
grateful for I think this is a good
exercise we should always remind
ourselves of what we're grateful for was
a tough fight that's yours
those are really your three things I
guess you're being very vague okay
Brittany puts smile you're you're
grateful for smiles ability to love and
good hair days alright see that's good
man that's what I would put it like
something like that life family and food
that's definitely good things to be
grateful for how about you Kane mine is
obviously my family good health in my
viewers which are you guys cuz you've
changed all of our entire lives YouTube
in general just all of that so tell me
what are three things that you're
grateful for I know this seems silly but
after a while it would open your mind up
to think about how grateful you actually
offer so many things today it's easy
because there's so many things but after
a couple weeks of doing this you'd be
like really thinking hard all right
we're gonna leave it at that let's move
you ready you ready two hours fight me
first person fight we'll be back boy all
right we're on the move
let's go I just started drivin oh you're
making me sick Brittany gets carsick and
I also don't care to drive all the time
so this is why she's always driving you
know what I like most about driving I'm
gonna pick on you guys yeah you know
actually I need you to write my grocery
list oh my god what am i your personal
assistant I hope you guys are having
such a good day who else noticed the
silly-string still on the back with the
Brittany woke up today with this crazy I
mean crazy idea you want to tell them
100 day chance a challenge of a hundred
days of what by eating real food what
does that mean cats be real you have to
make something real food
400 days I need to like one day like one
day I can do that now I'm a positive
person but a hundred days of anything is
pretty tough like that's tough it'd be
hard to eat bad Bronner days straight
we're gonna start a death Bella she's
lost it she's lost it so we because if
you have it in the house you're bad food
dog so I guess what I'm saying is we're
headed up right now first of all we had
to get some groceries anyway family
stuff we got to do it but Bernie woke up
this idea completely rocked our world
pretty sure you sink my ship with this I
will say this weeks before I started
filming my movie I went no no sugar no
added sugars for two weeks it was the
best I've ever felt in my life
I felt so good but I still choose to
feel like crap and eat the crap like
it's so good I'd rather feel like crap
then feel good just by choosing what I
mean I hate how powerful
after you clean it out for a long time
you don't really you in the beginning
you ready a little hooligan no I know
what happened everyone got sleepy
alright so the first thing we got to do
is eat before you grocery shop otherwise
you'll buy ten times more than you
actually need so we got this little
which is because we've got the food and
then they have a microwave
are we actually cooking our own food
one heat yours back up is it good want
me to put it back in
okay so when you say real food this
would be like real food like something
grew on a garden there's something that
came out of a chicken's butt and this
would be considered no oh and chicken
chickens good chugga chugga choo choo
you ready
Jane seen pineapples started singing
spongebob how long does it take the girl
pineapple that's right do you guys know
what we're having for dinner cane fresh
fish he's that he's never seen that in
his life
there's no way
like I said not yeah when we travel oh
look at this flounder
it's frozen over well I'm all right
skipping past that boring shopping stuff
we're headed to one more store
everyone's pooped out all right guys
we're kind of warping back home we're a
real-life Star Wars action going on here
shake your head if anybody wants to know
what it's like to run your own business
I'm gonna show you today a little bit of
what it's like I don't know how
interesting this will be for some of you
but our small more store has taken over
our entire basement as you guys know our
new buildings almost done we're gonna
move out next week I got to do some
photos that's right if you ever go to a
website and you see all these photos oh
yeah how's that done well we do it
everything so here's what I'm putting on
there photo area has been completely
taken over so that's going upstairs with
me right now
okay sounds good let's go
alright grateful bored you got a move
I'm grateful for the grateful bored a
lot of you guys may think when you go to
the website like man they must have a
studio and it's so professional I know
this is how we do it right here in our
living room baby now normally it is in
the basement but the basement is gone
consider it gone so we're gonna do it
right here in the living room the
cheapest light kit that I could find
online the cheapest stand in a roll of
white paper not kidding this is just
paper boom you see you can always wait
around to have the right things or the
best lights and the best of everything
or you can use what you have and make it
work
that is a real trick in life because a
lot of people are like well I would edit
but I don't have the best computer you
can buy you can edit on an iPhone
nowadays like you don't need the best of
everything anymore it's you see I would
play the drums but I had the best drum
set in the world you don't need a good
drummer can play on any you don't need a
good drum set to play drums right I'll
tell you what man a good guitar player
can take the cheapest guitar make it
sound good it's not about what you have
what you do I mean let's face it cane
could ride a horse but he has a dog
without further ado and inspired by you
guys so many of you guys have cakes to
say happy birthday with smile more logos
we thought we should come out with their
own party supplies this is the first and
one of my new favorite products in the
entire store focus baby smile more
balloons crazy when you boil these up
the logos like big
yeah okay that is awesome I love you
buddy
all right so I think the trickiest parts
gonna be able to get the logos to face
the camera because no matter what
they're swaying and turning it's almost
hard to stick them together all right
this is incredibly difficult I've used
little stickers from my windscreens to
hold the balloons together and these are
kind of free-floating
and I've just got hooked things but they
are facing me almost perfect what is
your dream car a mercedes-benz g-wagen
oh my gosh what is your favorite color
color yeah I like black the blacks not a
color so like the color orange Oh
careful I like purple - purple is
awesome haha that doesn't make you got
headed okay ask me a question hang on -
yes dead serious true story my brother
when we were kids we had a big weather
balloon for one of my parents flea
markets and we brought it down I guess
apparently Dale and Hale the helium and
just passed that story bro if you could
live anywhere in the world where would
you live tropical island somewhere
tropical is my dream like oh my god I
just wanna bail on a dream Island
Pacific and this should be called the
don't pass out challenge
oh my yeah whoa I'm borderline alright
this isn't healthy I don't think we
should do this Wow oh I hope I got the
photos I needed Kane just came and
destroyed my my work I know it doesn't
seem like it but I spent a lot of time
on that
