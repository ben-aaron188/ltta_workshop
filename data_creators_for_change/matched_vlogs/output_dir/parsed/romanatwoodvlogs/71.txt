what's up guys welcome to the vlog this
is completely opposite of how I would
ever want to start a vlog and we have
guests in town and we had to leave we've
been at the hospital for like ever
like it seems like forever she's been
getting sick since 2:00 in the morning
um it's been a very long night it was a
weird night kids were waking up Kane was
coming it was just a weird night it's
like a full moon or something
something's going on is freaky so Britt
Slater Hospital she's ivied she's got
fluids going in and she's literally been
throwing up since 2:00 in the morning is
bad so that's where we're at right now I
don't know what to do or say like I've
been going through all this all day
we're in the waiting room for three
hours like two and a half it's like two
and a half three hours in the waiting
room and I just didn't film anything
like we're literally just sitting back
here and I'm like maybe I should just
roll on camera so three and a half I
didn't know it's a long time I fell
asleep twice I was like down in my chair
like this this is all she's been living
on right here just ice only thing for
the last two hours I've been able to
like at least keep down for more than 15
minutes
yeah so you've done your unsent this is
crazy because we're never at the
hospital in the last month we've both
been in so we're either getting old
or yeah I think that's what it is I
don't know it's just weird my sister had
pick the same symptoms last week and
then she had one up there bring it what
it's called but it's for not like it's
for the stomach bug yeah I took one
and it didn't help thoughts I was like
oh God maybe it's something okay they
want to do a cat scan it done blood work
urine samples and then took a scan to
check her what was it like ovaries so
anyway guys hope you're having a
wonderful day hope you're having a great
day this is not the fun exciting vlog
that we had prepared today with Pete
Melissa who are just sitting at our
house for hours like we were like I
gotta take Brittany to the doctor's real
quick
I don't know how long we'll be but we've
been gone all day like all day so I feel
really bad like guess just our house is
full of people so they're not alone but
it does suck like we had all these plans
and it happens life happens that's
that's what it should say it life
happens can't expect it what if they
came in here and were like oh you're a P
word she got this little dropper going
into her arm yeah your backs covered up
yeah guys so we kind of reach the spot
where Brit is able kind of rest up
waiting on test results and she's really
just got her eyes closed and getting
some sleep right now wild night man like
I like she's up she's sick all night and
then Cora's up the babies up and then
Kane is coming in it's just like it's
like the twilight zone dude it was like
a nightmare it's like it was so tired so
while she rests I'm getting I did tweet
out that the vlog was gonna go up late
and that's what I'm coming out to the
car to do right now is get that vlog up
for you guys from yesterday so that's
kind of weird it's already done and
weird but that's what I'm doing right
now as we wait for tests I guess ice ice
and more ice so she can eat ice really
waiting waiting waiting waiting
it is a wait game and we're just sitting
here just doing our thing
getting real antsy though put starting
to town which is starting to bounce you
okay doing a bunch of jumping around but
Brittany's going to be good over this
mess or actually it actually you got a
lot of great things done today because
now you know there's nothing seriously
wrong it's a virus to get home get some
rest we're gonna take it very easy for
the rest of the day I'm probably gonna
go on kid duty and let Brist sleep it up
I don't think either one of us slept
really last night but we need a home
guys so that's where we're headed pretty
much I mean other than actually being
sick it's actually good news because she
did do this the Cask and the blood work
the urine tests and everything came
so that's awesome oh yeah not pregnant
Brian I hear you know it seems a little
repetitive that we just keep getting
these muddy and in there clean again it
looks good even x-rays clean whoo
get inside feels so good to be home I
honestly I don't think anybody really
likes to have to be at the hospital but
getting home from there feels great say
