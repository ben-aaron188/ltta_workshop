yesterday right now and here's the worst
part about blogging it's sad to say this
the thumb now the thumbnail is YouTube
has become nothing more that you're only
as good as your last thumb now honestly
God's truth like some of my best videos
I've ever personally thought I've made
have had the least amount of views
because of the thumbnail right and some
of my worst log have a great thumbnail
and that's all the matters now this
the thumbnail like odds are that if you
watch the video you might like but with
if you don't watch the video how will
you ever like it in a thumbnail is why
you watch tomorrow this video is going
to be our car she's not even joking so

guarantee there's gonna be food when
there's people okay so two things one
I'm gonna give a shout-out to the
manager BJ's because Pete and I were
like no I'm paying no I'm payin no long
pan and then the waitress comes over
she's like what's not necessary because
the manager is comping your guys's
dinner because her daughter's a big fan
so a huge shout out to the manager here

like we should order more food we're
walking out with all this food and
second thing while because we just ate

get rid of it isn't just diet is it
overall weight or is there like chewing
gum
