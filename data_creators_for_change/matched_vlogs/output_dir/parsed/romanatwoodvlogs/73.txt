so yesterday guys was a huge fit well I
don't know if it kind of was it it was a
fail knowing I spent how long did I
spend trying to get uh all day it wasn't
all day but no and I attempted to make
like a video game plot where we were
like we're playing fortnight coz he's
been hooked on fortnight and I always
play battlegrounds I was like all right
let's try this fortnight hang out so we
did that and I just could not figure it
out not the game core I couldn't figure
out the computer I just couldn't get to
record light or dark toast light or dark
if that's a question for today light or
dark toast guys so long story short we
did record here's a clip I didn't even
get anything good but like we finally
figured out how to record the gameplay
and I done this in the past and for some
reason I was using the Nvidia and then I
used OBS and I was confused and we
finally got a little OBS to work so

fans of battlegrounds and then he slowly
started playing for at night and I was
like what is all this hype about this
game so we're gonna do this whole like
battlegrounds verbs for at night video
yesterday and and took so long I worked
in a long time I really did the whole
goal of everything was just to kind of
compare the games and see why there's so
much hype on these games that's why
right right now if you like the games

did you almost have just a solid stuffed
animal there so I know I've already
asked you guys a lot of questions today
I asked you if you liked your toast
burnt or not burn I asked if you want
videogames livestreams and now I'm
asking you as a daily vlogger we usually
have to come up with some type of
entertainment in between our life oh
yeah so I mean oh yeah get it get it
okay let me get back to my point as a
blogger you usually have to entertain
your audience right and then and then
the family stuff is natural it happens
naturally but with the entertaining part
you got to come up with something you
know it's what are we gonna do today
that's the entertaining level of the
vlog right and today we don't have that
we were gonna do the video game stuff
kind of fell through so here's what I'm
asking you what are you doing today what
is it that you're doing today imagine
you've got to entertain a whole bunch of
people do you do what you're actually
doing right now today do you watch TV do
you play video games do what are you
doing to entertain a whole bunch of
people today I want to know that or I
always I always enjoy doing the
entertaining stuff we always have a good
time but lately we've been especially
Britney and the kids they've been
watching like our very old vlogs in the
best part of those vlog is the family
stuff it's me showing the kids it's it's
watching them grow it's you know it's
the normal life stuff that makes these
so amazing for us so when I start
freaking out oh my gosh how am I gonna
entertain you guys how am I gonna keep
you guys excited to watch these videos I
fall back on what do we love seeing and
that is like stuff like this the simple
stuff the squealing Cora the messy house
the change is the growth of family kids
I guess it's just it's just a state of
mind it's like as you know you want I
want to be a creator I I don't
necessarily just want to film my day but
when I think about vlogs that's the best
thing for us to look back on when we're
watching the vlogs and I'm like out in
LA working on him it's not that fun for
me to watch I like watching this right
here two years from now and we're like

say is that this will be no longer my
blog Channel and it snows vlog Channel

be actually a really great time
what are you seeing so you guys told me
I posted this before you guys told me
that cats do this because they're
imitating like another bird or a
squirrel they're imitating something
other than a cat so if they're out in
the wild and they're hunting he sees
that reflection somewhere see that and I
guess the cat's natural instinct is to
not act like a cat well if he was a cat
and the birds would run they don't
always run from a squirrel you don't
know what these young piece of be the
baby kitty so guys that's our home right
