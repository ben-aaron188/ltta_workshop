hit me in back in December when I was
missing a lot of logs like once a week I
would miss a blog and I was telling you
guys we were getting hit with Christmas
at the smile Moore store if you're new
to this channel I own a company called
smile more that's our merchandise a lot
of you are familiar with it but in
December we got hit really hard for
Christmas and I was missing like a week
a day a week out of the flog that I kept
saying the more I focus on smile more
the less I give the blogs and the more I
give on the blogs the less I give on
smile more so I haven't missed any blogs
this year except yesterday and we really
just crushed a smile more store and
that's what I'm doing today I'm
finishing up on picking up the last of
the merch and the website is restocked

here and get at you ha yeah we made it I
don't know which truck is mine it's
gotta be this big dog there's got to be

this is a much bigger truck than I'm
used to driving 26 428 foot 28 foot
truck here goes nothing see what this
baby's got my god I tell you a quick
true story when I was learning how to
drive back when I was like 16 years old
it was an online my car was an automatic
my parents car was an automatic so it
shifts for you you just drive when I got
my first car it was a stick a standard
you had to shift it I learned at the
dealership my first standard car I
learned at the dealership never driven
one before I just hopped in and learned
to myself how to drive it
driving home I was scared to death man
like every little incline you'd stop at
you have to you know let off the clutch
and go I did it I got home nope no
problems but I was I was pretty
terrified all right I made it not bad I
don't think I parked that good that's
not too bad that's whatever this will be
our largest order of smile more t-shirts
of all time all of these boxes smile
more 13,000 t-shirts guys 13,000 what I
never thought we'd order 500 t-shirts
let me just tell you guys something
right now I just peed behind that
dumpster that's not what I want to say
let me tell you something man every time
I do this stuff my eyes go like open
because I know a lot of you been with me
a long time and you remember us with
twelve t-shirts literally sending out a
handful of t-shirts and now we can't
even keep the store stocked if you go to
that website yesterday sold out sold out
sold out sold out sold out and you guys
see me picking up truckloads of this
stuff
I'm telling man smile more is turning
into a movement it's more than just two
words on a t-shirt it's it's a lifestyle
and I love it and I live by it I want
you to live by it you don't have to buy
a shirt to live by I'm just saying
the world needs smiles right now more
than ever you guys know what I'm talking
about you see what's trending you see
what's on the news they're negative
negative negative let's bring it up man
let's work to bring it up spread the
message I never shut up when I started
when I start like just printing and
ranting I never shut up going to pick up
now I gotta go somehow fit three pallets
of small more water bottles from my
brother's place so I'm gonna go there
right now hopefully it'll fit this thing
isn't this full so I made it back home
and I can tell you this this suckers
stuck no matter what that's just awesome
so now it's just a matter of making
space there's so many boxes our basement
is filling up I've been cleaning this
area out stacking this bright bugs
beanies we are trying sorry to be back
in shape I know a lot of you guys
probably assume that you go on the
website you order sure and some company
sends it out but what a lot of you do
know is we ship everything out of our
basement whoa we do it all right here at
our house
so yeah it's all family operated you
guys single-handedly employ like half
our family trampolines a problem many
ramps are a problem they're not really
getting that used this giant bag of
balls from the ball prank we still have
untouched that's one way to do it
all right as you can see I've made
pretty good space I gotta take a break
juice let's go upstairs oh we gotta
bring your ball a little much work for
today's vlog let's switch it up a little
bit
whoo we got going on up here
so if you have a chicken breast you've
ever made like like you pull it apart to
make like a chicken sandwich st you can
see the chicken bit brittany used to
spin like an hour pulling apart all this
stuff right at least 10 hours she would
spend pulling that 100 hour now she just
sticks it in a bowl and shreds it with
that and that's it folks
Brittany Smith's how-to in the kitchen
we showed you the wooden spoon last week
today blendin chicken I think you got
something there you can put that like in
a and a cup and drink it well little
loop-d-loop
I think it's time to go it's a beautiful
night guys
check out my building man smile more is
getting up great look what they did to
my son walk they cut it here to run the
water supply out to the building place
is a freakin mess I'm actually starting
to think we're gonna have a building
check it out these are huge stones and
apparently once it's level here they're
gonna they're gonna lay it all with this
stone I'm seriously gonna need a lesson
I've know I've never driven this thing
ever
never I'm like immediately questioning
whether this building is big enough it's
a 40 by 80 which it always looks small
at this point I know when my parents
built their house their first house it
was like it looks so small but once it
was done it looked huge so I guess this
is kind of deceiving right now and then
all this concrete
my brand-new driveway all this country
it's gonna be torn out rebuilt probably
from here and it's gonna slowly incline
into these two bays I literally I'm
trying to share everything with you guys
we have some we have some friends coming
over tonight Britney's preparing a
little dinner gonna take a little break
from this mom more stuff so we can
actually have a vlog today and yeah
that's it look what Brittany did - oh ho
ho ho check out my boots man trying to
update you guys Brittany got my office
pretty friggin nice and now I need like
shell I don't know what to do with all
my stuff charging stuff and every time I
look at you my eyes just light up every
time I see you in that cute little tank
top I just I start to blush and I had
that backwards out of yours it just just
does something to me come on buddy what
you want to do man this is my brother's
chair by the way he is hopefully taking
that home tonight I don't know yet it's
been buried in my office since we moved
in the house I can't pull you that's not
a sled that's a lid - a bucket I mean it
probably would Paul let me see
anything's possible anything is possible
warping into a little bit of time here
Dale showed up and he brought me because
we know that you haul stuff yeah the
best rope in the world thank you this
will do it yeah this will do it so we
are set for u-haul pole that's gonna
have to happen got Jeff his wife
Sierra house how's the food
Brett knows what she's doing man people
underestimate her have a camera blog
without food blog thank you she gave me
one to go you know what you know what I
do when I when she tells me no this
dinner is awesome we think mama well
take a break
bye you always lying we're talking we're
talking about we're talking about gas
prices and reassessment do you remember
what gas prices were when you started
driving well I scored a yeah I pulled in
50 cents worth of gas in that Cadillac
50 cents would do it yeah it would fill
it
so we have to all agree on one answer I
have never struggled so hard in my life
to play a game we're trying to play
would you rather board game and because
I just want to read because I just want
to read the cards I just want to pick a
be able to staple with your thumb and
forefinger Oh or have nunchucks for hair
numchucks for hair yeah
no I'm going with the staple technique
imagine how convenient if you can't use
what she thinks we're all gonna pick
bits this is like what roll
I want an egg roll all right so they
want to get a new game out I'm gonna
read a couple out just for you guys
you want a treat would you rather be
able to press a mute button to silence
children or be silenced adults that
would be epic which one would you choose
what I mean be amazing it's my last
camera all right guys we are heading
into that ending time I tried to give
you a little bit of a of a little more
raw style today kind of almost as if I
