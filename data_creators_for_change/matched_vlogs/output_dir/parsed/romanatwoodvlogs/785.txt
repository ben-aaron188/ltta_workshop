what's up guys good I'm gonna say good
morning I haven't started a vlog this
earlier a long time I'm taking my boy
Noah to school are you ready to start
your day
sure it's like nasty rainy clouds
feeling pretty good just I don't think
I'm awake I literally think I'm sleep
driving vlogging taking you to school
slash longer back to bed now
alright buddy I love you more than
anything I have an awesome day
thanks you positive positive thoughts
only oh yeah you know the rules ok I
love you I love you see you soon
ok so I dropped no off at school and my
buddy Jerry calls me he's like yo do you
have time to come in and test a silent
shotgun like a shotgun with a suppressor
this bad is I want to go back to sleep I
was like yeah let's do that to give you
guys an idea how quick I got up this
morning I'm wearing jeans that I haven't
worn for month like I don't even know
where these came from
in my old Nike Air Max these are
probably two years old or year old I
don't know what's up man good morning
you do the Big Dawg yeah Clifford
so uh I got here before the doors and
okay I've got so much worked on this
morning it's going off it's crazy when
you get up you actually get things done
alright so Jerry got me out here bright
and early what do we got here man what
are we doing we're gonna see the true
difference in salvos new 12-gauge
suppressor
I got an 870 right here we're going to
shoot a 3-inch slug through it
unsuppressed I'm going to just check and
see if there really is a difference in
between I wish I wish my camera had a
bet this is just a little camera but
hopefully the audio look at this thing
it's like carrying around a telephone
pole now and yeah that's that's a
semi-auto
running ten 1,100 with the salvo on it
so what we're going to do is we're going
to run unsuppressed then we're going to
run it suppressed and we're going to
find out if it really does fight it down
or not huh Gerry's my cameraman today so
here's where I'm going start with an
unsuppressed and let's just hear it
hopefully my camera picks up you know a
good amount
I pull his ears on
oh you remember
all right let's listen to it
pretty darn loud right here we go
definitely update I mean if they're loud
no matter what you can't get away from
the noise but there's a huge huge
difference you want to hear from back
here probably still sounds like a cannon
on this camera but guys you got to do it
you got to get up you got to live it
I'm looking at you right now you um
promise you that if you don't get up and
just make those first steps to doing
what you want to do and what you love to
do what you're passionate about what you
find in your heart that drives you
towards this thing it's not going to
happen we have to get up and do it I
promise you that the first steps you
have to do now maybe a lot of its going
to come naturally because of those steps
but those first steps you've got to do
man
I'm telling you guys quit wasting on
start really small don't worry about it
being a success tomorrow just start
small and work your way up part of the
fun is climbing that ladder part of the
fun and doing what you want to do is
climbing up you know what I mean like if
you were all the way at the top there's
only one place to go
that's down so the fun part is just
getting there like I don't think I would
ever want to consider myself at the top
of anything I think half the fun and
your motivation comes from wanting to
get there and that climb and and the
failures and the Falls and going back
and forth I mean that is the fun that's
the challenge challenges our heart we
so I encourage you guys without without
ranting too much in this blog to get up
take those little steps don't worry
about going huge more big and I need all
this money to start no just make those
steps forward I promise you there's
going to be a good thing nothing bad can
happen I'm going to start this vlog with
some motivations in positivity and and
smile more baby you guys know how I work
and how I push you guys I want you to be
motivated when watching floors
I want you to I want you to stop
watching this vlog and be like damn I'm
ready to go like that's what I want and
if you're trying to sleep I'm sorry I
don't wanna pump you up too much thank
you
hard body tacos well something I always
get you with your mouth full of food
morphing back home Britt made some time
now I'm sure you've eating sorry your
mouth boy every time I turn the camera
hey buddy how's my man it's like
Christmas mode Britt's got Christmas
music on it is you guys ready are you
guys ready
Cheers what happened I didn't even
realize what happened how'd you get a
hold of a tortilla oh you need to bite a
mouth into it oh boy a piece we got it
I'm hurt
yo we have an emergency situation here
okay let me give you the lowdown so it's
very common to superglue corals so see
this little coral without super glued or
just blow around the tank it'll go
behind the rock and die so todd has been
here superglue and little pieces of
coral on the tank but the first why
don't you tell them what happened oh
I've never seen that happen ever
oh so how's the superglue has come off
somehow and that hang on I gotta get
better lighting here somehow it's glued
Dory's it's stuck the dories teeth what
do we do
oh he usually comes to me but he's
probably freaking out oh yeah he's got
super glue stuck in his mouth where your
cleaner sure man they just cleaned that
right off
they don't want nothing to do with it
crazy thing is the fish is still eating
fine what it's almost off oh my gosh
it's almost off it's oh she's trying
well don't eat it there's a net look
he's trying to eat the glue again oh
that little rasps they're not gonna eat
that glued or any finger they think they
think oh man so have no idea what to do
fish seems fine but it's got glue stuck
to it
they have little teeth right in the
front and it wants the blue route the
fish bid on it and I've blurred to its
tooth we're still eating fine which is
weird
I said that's never happen I believe I
mean what's the odd all right fish
experts what do we do I imagine it will
just come off by itself right it doesn't
seem to bother it too bad I'm the one
that kind of looks like him there's the
spot on him man what are we gonna do on
this beautiful day honey whoa have some
hot coffee hot cup I've already had
