not just like Christmas I'm excited for
Christmas but I'm excited to like do the
Christmas thing that's how you know
I think that's why now I'm getting old I
swear this year's like I want it I want
to get someone to decorate put our tree
up on a because you're getting old
changing yeah so yeah even though it's
not even Thanksgiving yet we're both
like talking about Christmas stuff
putting our tree up you guys know we
have a giant tree fills this whole area
oh and you get all those scented things
that actually smells like a real tree
yeah
are you learning Europe you're
lock-picking skills boy this is just a
good game for you kids
yeah why not let's load it up lights it
leat let's bring in real leaves from
outside and no wood you see what I got
teas for the golf balls they hold the
golf balls up so you don't hit the grass
so easily it pops up it's freezing it
looks so nice and sunny but it's
freezing no Brittany just came out with
possibly one of the greatest ideas she's
ever come up with ever in her life she
just said what if we built okay if you
guys remember the video where I filled
my house with plastic clay balls
we built a trampoline upstairs so I
could jump off the top floor she said
why don't we build it downstairs we have
all this space we have really high
ceilings probably doesn't look high on
the on the vlog but they're high enough
for the kids
I don't know I think it's a genius plan
I don't know if it's all enough what do
you mean oh it's all enough
well the half size if you built it half
this is the actual gas pump from the
stealing gas prank I still have that so
I opened up all the trampoline parts and
I figured you could build this without
the poles here shut up you could do it
like this without the center post
I think they would buy them out
Jane would know the bigger kids would
know would you think I'd still foot for
foot
I don't know you could try it and see ah
luckily my brother's coming over he's
the expert on building everything when
he gets here we're gonna ask him let's
get his opinion on it kids and I didn't
need it I don't know if I ever showed
you guys this we kept one bag from that
prank those are all the balls from the
prank still there's done things that I
shoot that blow up we should put one in
that bag just leave thousands of balls
all over someone's here
what are you hiding
I said someone's your keys took off the
hide Cain's not here I don't know what
that is it's not Kane hey dude your eye
thing you can move one and the other now
try it do cross it just brought over the
mother lode of nachos look at this I
love when you visit the girls are
cooking for me so been wanting to do a

but a trampoline in the basement hey
Britt great idea

really bad ideas become reality here you
go you guys ready come check it out come
