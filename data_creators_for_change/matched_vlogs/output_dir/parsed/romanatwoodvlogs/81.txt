you're set up you ready to go okay I got
a question I got a question for yourself
this is for everybody I'm gonna ask for
it first would you rather have $1,000 in
cash
$1,000 cat I could hand this to you it
would be you're not or would you rather
have $1,000 worth of scratch off lottery
tickets
I'm gonna take the cash just the
guarantee but there could be hundreds
thousands of dollars in here yeah could
be so you'd rather have just the
guarantee of a flat 1,000 then the
potential of hundreds of thousands of
dollars what we scratch off first okay
yeah let me I want to ask everybody
would you rather have $1,000 cash or
$1,000 worth of scratch off the scratch
off it could be all losers it could be
hundreds of thousands of dollars for
sure cash cash Veronica
what would you rather have just straight
cash hard cash or thousand dollars with
the scratch off and look just this one
you can win 15,000
okay so you can all right so we'll see
how much we get in these scratch offs
Emily scratch your money I go scratch
scratch oh let's do that we will skip
over there my back yeah cash for
scratch-offs I don't know what they want
you won't scratch offs I'll do scratch
jobs okay that's a lot prescribe it's
risk what it's risk and reward that's my
spot yeah there you go okay guys welcome
to today's video is gonna be a little
strange first of all remember that
tattoo video we just didn't like I knew
my burnt mirrors it's like she won't
first of all it's hard to get off so
it's probably just like rubbed it too
hard
to think I thought you run the cool spot
even bring my two things one we did this
way back when maybe in the summer of I
don't even remember when okay we done
this before and it was kind of a theory
of like is buying lottery worth it
because for the most part I've we've
never played in our lives the only time
I've ever played ever was to make that
video and today we're gonna do it again
also I've been trying to come up with
ideas to do that I can sit down and do
because my back is just so like I get
all hyper and I go out there and I
filming them like oh so we're trying to
do some sit down things over the last
couple days and here we go
so here's the theory guys and I've
always had this mindset my dad taught me
young he said you can you can earn a
million dollars before you could win a
million dollars now there's a lot of
luck out there people randomly win a ton
of money but for the most part there's a
lot of losers like there's a lot of
people that lose a lot of money so that
being said let's see if one thousand
dollars let's see if we can get our one
thousand dollars back like yeah we need
to break-even that's the goal yeah if
you win more that's that's the one but
there's a lot of chances here look at
this okay so I guess the first thing we
got to do is just start scratching so we
have all of these tickets they're all
different they're from different they're
also purchased at different places some
are twenty these are ten we went with
some bigger ones so they don't take this
long like this is $30 a ticket play this
$30 for one of these now for me the
lottery is two things one is like if you
play because you you thoroughly enjoy it
and it's fun and you don't mind like if
I was gonna buy a $30 ticket I would
have to go in there with the mindset
that I'm losing $30 but I'm playing but
the game is costing me $30 basically is
how I would do it even I've never heard
of someone winning a billion dollars
first of all there we go maybe we're
just completely amateur
lottery players scratch off players Bob
I mean the line things like you have to
read and see like what well these ones
are easy you scratch all those and you
scratch all those did you scratch them
all so let's just do one here we'll do
one together then we can we can speed up
the process from there yeah so these are
your we're winning numbers you scratch
them and then you try to match them
scratch an imagine it's hot hot symbol
and you in all 25 prizes shown ok let's
see that gold charlie leave a comment
right now before you've seen if we've
lost the bunch or we won what would you
take the thousand cash for the stack a
lot of tickets like there's a lot of
risk here you could end up with a $300
you can end up with 10,000 you can into
a billion dollar survey let's start
someone win the price in automatic no I
already have $5 ticket you're not even
even yet take anymore you need more Oh
was that my numbers are too complicated
if any one or more of your numbers match
any of the winning numbers you win the
prize shown vacuum so I've already won
$2 Oh
big money rolling yeah they're gonna let
you win on the first numbers 31 I got
another 5 I broke even on my first round
ok so long each card so this is kind of
an experiment to 5 million 5 bill you
guys do with the honestly a buddy nobody
even do it that baby $90 ah are you
serious of the first card 110 110 off
the first car yeah ok so so that card
was $20
she won a hundred and ten dollars well
just so you know I am I haven't won a
single thing off this $30 card so that's
gonna put us way down so you match one
of the numbers I didn't match a single
number no it's a dud you don't have any
of the numbers there's not a single
match
thank you there whatever so that puts us
30 under that's a $30 card that's goes
into the check again loser pile zero on
that oh that's - that's 30 and 20 that's
50 in the hole on two cards - cards that
win anything so right now that one card
is the only thing holding us above water
passive now all right
another $30 card with zero payout
another loser yeah okay so that's a
sixty seventy eighty ninety a hundred
bucks we're only up $10 now on oh oh
yeah because that one cost 20s were
negative ten already oh it's a little um
it's a little bit kind of hard to film
like all of this but we have a lot
looser cards I just scratched my first
one that actually has a payout because
the cards $30 and I have one 20 40 60
goes 5 bucks 20 on 5 okay all right
we're slowly creeping up that ladder
that's their case we're gonna get this
mug back scratch and scratch in church
and stretch in scratch I mean it's good
it's kind of like fidgety you know
cigars
okay so right now we have we're at we've
been scratching like maniacs in here we
have spent off six hundred and five
dollars and we have won four hundred and
forty that's not terrible it's still
lost but we stuck all these all these
tickets so we're gonna be floating right
around that that right
crap 5 10 15 20 hmm
what's a 6 2500 yeah just keep
scratching oh yeah just keep scratching
just nothing effort no try again
Oh 10 bucks 10 bucks we're coming back
baby how the card was 10 bucks no profit
and we need one more
we need one more for bean to 21 25 49
exhaust one two three four five six
seven eight dollars so far is a dollar
every single winner every time
one dollar oh my god at that rate baby
at a dollar at a time we're gonna be
back I'm gonna be back on top so I have
so many loser cards they can't I only
scratch the number and then if I see the
number then you scratch what you want
I'm not winning someone who can scratch
although imagine just stretching every
time I get a number and then scratch
below it's like $3 bottle there's some
you skirts like $500,000 15 bucks on
pause that's profit baby flash black we
should called you scratch mister he's so
into everything we're doing but he
there's no idea why we do it
oh that's what do you want this is all
about the serves amber a thousand
dollars cash or a thousand dollars with
a lot of tickets which one you want I
said lottery tech you going lotto well
team lotto it might be in the hole baby
Britney's got a scratch on this Oh minds
like there's more on the back okay girl
look at this table we're in the floor oh
ma look at my fingers I got that I got
that work work fingers is 49 yeah it's
30 uh 32 on this side and 17 on that
side
Oh pull it out sixteen sixty mom that's
what rush okay hey we stretched all up
guys I feel pretty defeated I'm not a
lot I feel like I knew exactly coming
into this game that I was gonna well
that's a 12 hey these are no good we
want to refund
Britney's doing the math she's adding up
the winnings we already know that total
we have a thousand dollars
out so let's see what's gonna come back
in not looking good I mean it's actually
it's really bad really bad this one we
did this a while back we did this
experiment of fun actually like it win
or lose it's kind of fun I get it
I'm not one to die like making my money
make more money this is kind of what
went opposite of my 676 just 60 60 70 %
67% yeah um we did this last time when
we end up with six hundred and something
Wow
oh so I guess if you want to lose 40% of
your money
throw it in the scratch-off lottery
tickets you know I wonder how okay so we
played a thousand we played a thousand
we got six no no we got six on I wonder
how many times you got a play before you
get that one card that one card and
that's what the things all about that's
the addiction right because you think
you're gonna get that was the whole roll
of something like that doesn't mean you
wait is that rawest every stage oh I'm
the same like so you yeah I wonder how
much you actually the winnings is out of
the whole brain out of the whole roll
there it is I'm like I'm gonna keep my
theory you gonna make a million before
you win a million bran no it's the heart
about it's the hard round
I know it's hard so what was this all
about what was this all about is fun
right we lost money but you lose money
doing all kinds of things right foolish
things knowing you ain't gonna win no
and you're not gonna win okay it would
just be yeah you want that one yeah like
a $500 winner would at least be like you
spent a thousand yet BAM you got some
time but now that's the game that's the
game this is genius for those that
create it those that play it there's a
lot of risk you want all these big time
he had to take it's all out first day
yeah well I think oh yeah it went much
now you got to buy me stakes so if we
want it was stakes we lost so it's it's
subs yo I just want you to know if you
picked lottery tickets
you'd end up with six hundred and sixty
bucks
660 sure took the cash I take the cash
bubbles took the cash you may lose box
maman maman do it yeah okay so that's
our video for today guys super quick
little IIIi don't think it's a challenge
video it's like how do you lose a
thousand bucks fastest challenge I think
it's really weird we did this before and
we ended up with almost the exact same
