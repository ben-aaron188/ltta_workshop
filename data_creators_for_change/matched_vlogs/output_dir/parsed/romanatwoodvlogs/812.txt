room
decorating Halloween
I'm gonna just say it everything's so
different when you don't drink alcohol I
have a head up on like 70 days what's
gonna hey what's up guys how are you
dude our walk home looks so safe
like I feel safe here um I just want to
say life is so different when you don't
drink alcohol like I'm walking around
with these guys they've been drinking
look I know but I had I had a glass of
cranberry juice tonight and I'm just
watching it I'm inside the club guys and
I just realized how different it is when
you don't drink so here we are New York
City I guess you got to get a slice of
pizza yeah how is it good is it I know
different slice here remember here for a
slice bread we're trying to find our way
home New York is crazy man no matter
what time it is
alright guys we are actually back to the
room I don't know what to think about
this vlog I feel like it was super noisy
super loud just crazy um I know this is
gonna sound really stupid but I still
haven't drinking any alcohol and I'm
actually really proud of myself because
these things that we do these places
that we go there's so much influence to
want to drink I know it's silly like I
can have a drink or two and enjoy the
night but for some reason I just haven't
it just feels good so I encourage you
guys maybe there's something you're
trying to just stop doing and no matter
how hard it is you can do it because I'm
doing it and it feels good like I'm
happy because now I come to my room and
I'm able to edit this vlog like no
problem I can stay up I can edit or I
can wake up feeling good in the morning
or when I used to drink it would be so
hard to just edit at night or get my
work done so those are those are some of
the reasons why I have quit it's because
I have to work I need to edit I need to
be ready in the morning for streamcon
and it's just it's a good feeling man I
know I'm just letting this out but it's
true um Brittany obviously drank we love
you guys so much we uh just couldn't
think listen all these sirens man New
York is so great listening and while
every all parts of the day
it's just like all gold right thank you

pretty silly love you smile boy I saw so
many comments yesterday people like why

why it is really weird being out in
public with it though everybody looks at
me funny have you ever seen somebody
