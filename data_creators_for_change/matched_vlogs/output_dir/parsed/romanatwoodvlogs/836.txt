something like that
I want to talk to you guys for just one
minute hear me out I sorry I see in the
comments and I see I see what's going on
I feel like we're shifting back the way
we used to be and we've lost connection
together and we're we're not talking to
each other in the comments and there's
there's so many negative comments and I
feel a lot of that is because of my
energy I feel like my stress has come
right out through that camera into you
guys and I apologize for that it's the
worst feeling in the world I want you
guys to watch these vlogs and feel so
good I want you to be motivated after
you watch them I want you to take on the
world after you watch these vlogs the
last thing I want is to bring anybody
down nobody not my enemies I don't want
to bring anybody down yeah when you
watch these vlogs I want you to feel
good I want you to be happy manners so
there's so many reasons to be unhappy
and miserable
grumpy and negative when you watch these
vlogs I want it to be one reason out of
your whole day that's a chance at
cheering you up that's my goal it's such
a big goal of mine and and I feel like a
lot of it's been my fault the last few
days I've been struggling mentally with
some things but I feel good man I'm
happy my family's happy so I hope that
we can just reset and build a positive
army of people man just so powerful and
strong and you can just beat the hell
out all these negative thoughts you know
it's hard it is we can do it promise
welcome back we got a serious problem
guys we need your help okay I got my
ears pop we've had the same dishwasher
the same soap
we've changed nothing we've lived here a
year and a half yeah everything's
covered in white powder like momma left
her bag of cocaine in there it does not
come off easy the whole Oh what is that
it doesn't come off no it's it's like
dry and hard like iron in the water
here's another big issue is that this
has been washed twice four times one
with just water yeah and it doesn't come
off it just doesn't it just look it's
always some when you're a homeowner it's
always something like the weirdest thing
I never heard of this look at Cannes

this I'm sure that one of you have had
this problem or your parents have had
this problem how do you fix it I would
say maybe change the changing so swell

at it it seems like the whole dish
washer fills with soap and then the heat
comes on and it never gets rinsed
