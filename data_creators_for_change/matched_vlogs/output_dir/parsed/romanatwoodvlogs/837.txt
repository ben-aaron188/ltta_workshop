always loved what were you gonna say
um we're always trying to do like fun
stuff to entertain them and yesterday we
just did I know I have like a uh a
mental block when we're just at the
house all day I'm like there's something
my mind says nobody wants to see this
they just don't want to watch this and
then I try to realize that that is
vlogging vlogging it's just our life and
and and I think what a lot of vloggers I
know I do is we don't realize that
vlogging is just about our life in our
real life and sometimes going out doing
crazy stuff just isn't real that's us
trying to make an entertaining
right so the real vlog is us at our
house doing nothing
