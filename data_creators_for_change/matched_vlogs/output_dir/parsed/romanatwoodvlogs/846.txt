I'm get you to go to those video cameras

magnets wherever we travel so this one's
perfect it's a little CN Tower okay so
we're going up to what's this twist on
the book out level the lookout level
which is way higher than the spot we
just were level where you where you ate
the elevator to go up way up I know
that's what we're going yeah so we're
going to the time 147 building stories
there we go you can see through the
elevator
crazy why the stairs aren't all she has
come on you can I guess that's an option
you can climb this tower after stairs
that's where we were just walking on the
edge of the the buildings way higher
everybody have a good time that's pretty
freakin awesome I will say after you
after you've been walking out on the
edge the rest of the towers pretty cool
thing like it spoils you it does so
we've just gotten up to this there were
three why are we so tired you said this
would happen
we get so much adrenaline from walking
on the edge of the world and we'd come
down and be boring
so we're sitting on this awesome rooftop
I know it doesn't seem like what we are
and we got a pretty cool spot this is
great man okay so we stopped for a snack
we stopped yeah this is this is pretty
unbelievable this is it's what it's like
hanging out with Pete it's just
abundance of food you have a long trip

tricks up our sleeves I hope how are we
gonna pull this off with like so much so
you do really careful cuz they're gonna
know something yeah like well we can
open the jars up beforehand they're
probably gonna be downstairs in the
basement for a little bit that's true

same time but we actually bought the
baby food like we were filming it so we
actually saw yeah yeah when you think of
when you think of something that smells
exactly like it tastes I finished it I
swallowed it we were gonna get like
really expensive no it can't be no worse
