after that you were allowed to have one
week vacation per year so you would work
and you'd say hey in July I'm gonna take

Brittany's in the front
hey feeling oh no I don't think so
hey feel like legit so I see whoo I feel
like that was super risky oh my god
we've all safely made it to the bottom
and I got to tell you we took a very
very easy light trail and to me it felt
extremely difficult oh I don't know
about this whole thing right now we
haven't been able to do this yet on our
whole trip this is our first attempt I
think we're gonna still hold off it's
crazy even for like talking to people
that are good at this it's like this is
not the condition to be out here so all
right guys let's do some lift talk ski
lifts talks right now cuz I'm sure you
guys have a lot of questions I see it in
the comments I have honestly been scared
of my social media every time we take
any time off it's it's honestly a little
nerve-wracking getting on social I avoid
Twitter I just go into like complete I
just disappear it's like it's super
windy Wow I can't but I think I think
that we should just say everything
family wise is absolutely wonderful guys
the time off that we do take is so
appreciative it is absolutely amazing
like living life without a camera is
amazing it is great we love filming our
life it is so much fun we do a lot of
fun things that we may not even do
without the camera when we vlog sort of
life is so we've just been so blessed to
have both this
you guys and our family life we try to
mix it the best we can mixed with our
fun are our actual life our family and
then sometimes we just hot lately it's
been like let's just go offline for a
few days like let's just play games with
the kids look it is a different life no
matter how much I don't even expect
anybody to understand this but it is
different off-camera you know like
there's a ski pole keep all freeze
people it's like buried in the ice -
what would you say about like our time
off like how is it I think it's just
much needed for us like it's a mental
break oh it is it's a reset for me it
really isn't I think that I'm running
out of time because we're gonna come off
here but I think that we just needed a
little reset that's all I guess that's
really what it is a reset yeah kind of
great time together like our first day
off we were like this has been the
greatest day ever really stayed in our
pajamas and watch like six movies yeah
we don't ever do it cuz if you did that
in a vlog your channel would die
instantly so life's different off camera
guys and you need to understand that as
you watch us like this wind is crazy
like this look at that but we love you
guys it is so good to just pick this
camera up and say hello and look how far
this place goes Wow we've been on this
trip this is our first attempt to even
try boarding it's been so icy and rainy
