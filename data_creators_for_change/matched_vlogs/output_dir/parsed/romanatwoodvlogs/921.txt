hey hey my friends I hope you are
feeling good today I'll tell you what I
give major credit to people that live in
the city I am from the country and every
time I come here the addresses don't
work like they work out there
it's just I'm always lost basically ver
a bunch of papers I'm always lost
skooby new hallways it feels really good
to be in the city today guys it's like
it's got a lot of energy a lot of evil
crap goes on downtown too but there's
always good that goes on - it's just a
it's just a different environment man
people moving and hustling and working I
love it I love it
that building right there is where we
won against the City of Columbus for our
ATM prank right there spent two days
inside there fighting that case man
we won - your basement looks so much
better you put the lights
what's up buddy get my haircut
thanks for telling me guys okay held
your bird that thing's shop since 1978
1978 they got a really old bird man 30
does he ever talk put a fart machine and
that was in the can it's right
underneath the bird so people sit down
with birds and starts farting it's great
idea love it
what are you guys doing on this
beautiful rainy day my hair is all
fluffed and feathered I need some jet
there we go
the better
alright guys listen to me really close I
got something for you today
and it's something that it's not easy I
got something new for you to try and
it's not easy I even I'm you know I do
this I'm trying to do it
turning problems energy like imagine
somebody makes you mad instead of
getting mad and doing some stupid saying
some stupid what if you can use that
energy that you get when you're mad man
I'll clean the whole house when I'm mad
like it gives you so much what I'm
saying is you can actually figure out
mentally how to turn frustration or
anger into a positive in turn turn it
into use that energy it's so powerful to
do something productive with it
what if you're mad man somebody's ticked
you off what do you want to do you want
to fight bad you want to but what if you
took all that energy it did something
productive with it that's something that
I'm working really hard on guys that's
something you know it's it's along the
lines what I always tell you about being
happy thinking positive doing better be
a good person I know I know I know this
is a lot to take in and it's a lot to
think about it but give it a thought
because think about how much energy you
have when you're mad I know every one of
you have been mad before and you're on
fire you could flip a car over you have
so much energy but we waste that energy
what if you used my energy on something
you want to do it's really hard it's
really hard we all know it that's why
it's easy to be negative
alright enough of that not for that
