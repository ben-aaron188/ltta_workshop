all right guys now for the not-so-fun
part of the vlog we went over my
brothers and we hung out with fam we had
a great time but there's some things
that we need to talk about you're gonna
notice listen to me back very closely
listening you're gonna notice some
changes with the vlogs right now you
probably already have noticed can't
really talk much about what they are but
I'm pretty sure you're gonna figure it
out on your own
and I just need you to know that this is
the best for me and my family right now
that has to be done has to be this way
right now and I'm just asking for you
guys to respect it
and try to understand it it's very
confusing right now I know but it is
it's gonna it's it's gonna work itself
out so that's that I can't say anything
about it right now
it's it's a it's a it's a sensitive
subject
I don't really know what to say and I
don't know how to say it so I'm just
asking you guys for the support and just
understand that it's only for the best
right now that whatever changes you may
notice is happening and I just thank you
guys so much for you know being here
with us and understanding these things I
don't know it's said that all being said
I do got a bounce I do gotta go I'm uh I
made a jump a big jump to a new editing
software today I've been using Final Cut
7 for the life of me like as long as I
can remember I've been using Final Cut 7
I've jumped to the new premiere
for so many reasons I've jumped to this
new premier and you know moving to a new
editor is just so weird not that it's
hard or it's I don't know I just don't
get it so I'm gonna spend most of the
night trying to figure out how to edit
this vlog it's normally I'm just like a
whip at it but now I have to learn all
the basics so uh so that's it guys
thanks for hanging out with me and me
and my family and for all your love and
support please no negativity I don't
want any negativity out of this I'm just
telling you guys so that there's a
little understanding that things are you
know changing right now
so we'll figure it out but I love you
guys we will see you tomorrow thanks for
everything and stay positive man keep a
big smile on your face you're beautiful
what's in that bucket right there
