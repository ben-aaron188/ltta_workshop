friends it is absolutely breathtaking
today we've just arrived to a little
place called Paradise Cove and I don't
think it's hard to figure out why it's
named Paradise Cove it's supposed to be
one of the greatest snorkeling spots on
the island in fact behind these islands
I guess is where you go out and you
snorkel people come here three four
times a year just to snorkel these spots
they're protected you're not allowed to
fish here so it really makes for a
beautiful reef and as you guys know by
all my vacation videos and my lifestyle
I love the ocean my entire tattoo is the
ocean I have a little ocean in my living
room I'm addicted to it so that's why
you always find me in these beautiful
little spots right here hidden amongst
the earth pot baby huh
ready to do this can be awesome you see
an octopus today no one wants to find an
octopus you know how hard they are to
find like sand castle let me see Oh
think you need wet arse and you need wet
sand stick
here we are day 35 basta see nothing to
be found
just the beautiful coral reef it goes
all up and down these rocks and there's
the beach way over there and they put
these little basely breast areas for you
to catch your breath and know you're
doing awesome and I'm so proud of you
coming out here this is ruff ruff water
but we made it
I'm so proud of you did you did the
whole trip guys this is I don't have you
can tell far this is but we start down
on this end and dropped off in a boat
all the way down and then the current
push that's pretty far out this way so
now we did a very adult snorkel trip
ocean makes you hungry man swim it just
burns calories we got here the girl
caught a grouper I like I like what you
taking Noah y'all kinda stuff fresh
mango daiquiris fresh mango
I keep seeing all the locals drinking
this right here ginger beer I thought I
had alcohol doesn't it's just like a
ginger ale and it's actually canned it's
actually can't here in the Bahamas 1874
that's good you wanna try that it's like
really good ginger ale yeah no it
doesn't have beer would I give you
something I'll go in it
no never
it's soda it's like root beer you drink
root beer ginger beer it's super good
okay so apparently guys if you hang a
bag of water just a bag of water in a
ziploc bag it keeps all the flaws wet
what do you think of that
I don't know if it's true so that's the
trick of the day bag of water over your
food over your kitchen over your kitchen
table oh that look I want that yes had a
great time check this little shopping
card out Kane it's a little different
than at home you can't really ride in it
well Paradise Cove was freaking
unbelievable guys definitely if you come
to this part of the Bahamas you go there
10 out of 10 in my book
they're losing it we need syrup for
pancakes tomorrow oh you found your
favorite all-in-one peanut butter and
jelly all-in-one what would you do with
yourself

this whole jar one here on the back side
of that little island snorkeling Noah
