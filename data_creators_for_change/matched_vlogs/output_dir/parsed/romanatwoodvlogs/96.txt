goes on land and water full that camera
goes on land and water there's any
bigger a need luggage hand right but now

missed you like crazy I know a lot of
you guys are some comments where is Noah
so he had a wonderful trip that he went
on his crazy and now we're trail riding
over
all right we found we what happened
buddy what happened we have found a bit
of water that it looks like a good spot
I mean not not here obviously it's more
than hoof prints those are hooves
so we're thinking there's a nice spot
over here it will drive the Argo into
the water and we'll take the this this
stream just see what I mean I'm really
just saying we get enough use that we
just sit him off the cliff here sit 10
million likes and really likes doable
yeah went on over here and a mom dad was
the country cream beer start a kid and

face wash two hours later

five o'clock country what's seating
arrangements like on the rail on the
rack oh by the way that's the camera

nice comparison yeah absolutely
