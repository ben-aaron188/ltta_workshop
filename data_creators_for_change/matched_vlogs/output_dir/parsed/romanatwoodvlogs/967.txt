to you we told you if we got 50,000
likes on a vlog a few days ago that we
would do the thousand dollar lottery
challenge this is $1,000 worth of
lottery tickets it's a lot it's crazy
this is how it's gonna work we're gonna
start scratching we're gonna guess who
who's gonna get closest what what do you
think we're gonna end up with when we've
scratched them all off I'm gonna go with
600 for 400 that's it I'm going with 600
if we make anything above $1,000 we're
gonna donate it we haven't figured out
where but we're gonna donate it anything
below a thousand we're keeping to claim
for our losses so let's do this
are you ready yep I don't know what I'm
gonna use
he's an old washer is that washer work
Greg from Nebraska all right let's do
this let's jump this jump
I'm start with the $10 actually we're
both starting with a $10 ticket this is
$10 for this ticket so let's see what we
win if she gets any of these numbers she
wins the prize that it says which oh man
that 10 bucks is going quick this is
painful I think there's this many
numbers in the alphabet oh you just
straight lost 10 bucks oh my gosh are we
seeing this right ah are you seeing that
right her first ticket is a total loss
this is also the first lottery ticket
we've ever played in our lives neither
one of us has ever bought a lottery
ticket and it is a complete loser 10
bucks down the drain this will be the
loser pot now this will be the loser
yourself right in the fire yeah the
loser pile goes in the fog all right
we're just in the fall we're just gonna
start killing these things we're gonna
have to check really close 10 you lost 2
5 10 5 and 10 all losers so far we're
off to a rocky start
No okay this is a $30 ticket this ticket
cost $30 you have to write okay this is
a $5 ticket so for those of you that
have never played lottery like us I'm
gonna show you real quickly how these do
work usually they just have winning
numbers that you scratch off once you
scratch them off all you have to do is
get one of those numbers and you win a
prize if I have 40 45 50 50 bucks on a
20 all right all right it's like you can
lose 10 and win one and you feel so good
a $30 loss are you trapping me no I'm
leaving this wrong another 30 completely
zero I got a double check these I don't
know okay our first winner
we won $10 on a $5 card that's good
awesome there's 25 there's 25 25 rich
hundred okay that's good we needed that
yeah you're just one of hundred dollars
on this ticket oh yeah I'm doing it
right what are you talking about I'm a
professional now all right so uh oh you
know what let's write down so we don't
add this stuff all right so what she
goes and grabs a jacket I'm just gonna
tally up we have four winning tickets we
have one two three seven eight nine ten
fifteen sixteen sixteen losing tickets
damn
I can't wait to burn these I just can't
wait to burn all right guys we're all
done man you created like a you could
rebuild a lottery ticket I think at all
this we are all done let's count up the
winning and the losing you count the
losers 20 winners these are the loser
part you don't realize we had that many
53 losers 20 winners not even half okay
let's find out how much we got back okay
so guys we spent $1,000 cash we put in
our guesses I said 600 Brit said 400 I
know all you guys voted in yesterday's
vlog what you thought the number would
be so here we go let's find out what it
is you do this yeah now this is the only
winner on the whole book 20 and we did
the bingo ones which all were losers
wait did you win it no they're all
losers she is doing the math right now
will we break even
will we get half our money back that's
what I want to know I mean there's a
couple good winners in there a lot of
bad ones yes I can turn you off really
that's a 12 more than half more than
half I was closest
wait without going over all right 400 he
said sit there it is we ended up with
five hundred and thirty seven dollars
back losing just less than half the
money I'm glad we did this you know what
this is a good eye-opener for me for you
