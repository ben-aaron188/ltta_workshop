guys welcome to the vlog we were at it's
absolutely beautiful I mean gorgeous
probably the best weather should we
we've come across its ugly outside man
it's rainy it's cool it's not freezing
cold which is great thinking positive
here so here's the thing I got Shawn
here in town
I've got Tanner Foxx in town and we had
these plans everything outdoors but it's
just raining and it's just it's just
rain and that's Ohio like you never know
if it's gonna be clear arranged so we
have to do some indoor activity thing we
have is outdoor you guys know we always
do outdoor activities so we had to we
had to make adjustments oh we've gotten
I did adjustments were made adjustments
were made so what can we do even though
we're outside right now like we're
vlogging right now just fine oh that's a
terrible excuse yeah but we wanted to
play in the mud and stuff that's we
gotta wait for the mud to get ready
what's up
we got build it Brian here gonna help us
with this project today and we're
basically just rushing out to pick up
some things hopefully we can find them
and then we're rushing home we're gonna
be at the house today having some fun
the real question is does Brittany know
about the fun does let me know about the
new plans you know what it doesn't
matter today so hopefully we can find
the things we need we're gonna get them
real quick and then blaze home by the
way you can't really tell you came from
my house oh no I did you guys have mud
that's 100 like 15 minutes bro yeah yeah
it is the mud house so we're at a giant
like outdoor camping hiking biking you
name it grocery karting everything
country country karting there you go
Brian I look nice on you man
purple people eater the slopes with cars
where would you even where would you
even find something like this this is
like I'm not all weight climbing maybe
you need some butter some butter butter
you find it yeah that's fine it's Oprah
yeah wait what is this what is this this
is to build a ladder is that what that
is why I mean
I rock but it's rainy no let's put one
of these in the house over the pond over
the ice actually really cool imagine
building a chill and yo and we cut out
the ice let's do it that's all right
let's get one let's get me which one do
we get so they got some rock holds this
is kind of what we're looking for but
they are actually I can't find that my
fingers I got to get them practice it's
for like Gora Gora Kumail encore the
Explorer
okay these might be too small for us we
found this slackline that's gonna
replace for now our rock holds what's
your number one cuz you've done this
what's your advice number one a piece of
advice
go slow start off with someone sitting
on it kind of oh wait someone else
because it holds it down that's good sit
down shut on one leg go the other leg
and then start walking slow but don't go
too fast okay well not mission
accomplished we did not get what we came
for but it's not a total loss because we
found this crazy slackline which I've
never been able to do I've tried it one
time and it was really wobbly and we
left with the Tonys chocolate bar
chocolates this beautiful weather oh
okay
so what we're on the road looking for
which we may have found a new place only
six miles away what we're looking for
they're cold I believe they're called
Rockhold's and these these are what
you're used to indoor climbing you would
you would mount these onto a wall and
then you're able to use them to grip and
climb shut Siri
so we're basically out it's nasty
outside but we need something to do
inside why not construct why not
I'm sure there's a million reasons why
not right there just definitely should
be reasons why not but I was thinking
maybe an indoor rock climbing wall I'm
not gonna lie this looks more us right
here this looks like where we find stuff
you gonna want to roll your window up
it's raining you can roll that up so we
just stopped into Clintonville
Outfitters and my man here is you're the
owner yes and he's helping us out so
he's got literally like a box of just a
few holds and he's like I can help you
out and give you some of these dude this
is legit that's the dragon right there
hahahaha and I love that there's single
bolts cuz we don't have a lot of like
mounting options right to it amazing
this is a great start
get down there get get down from there
Sean down that kick him out go and kick
him out that's what we need
he legit has the setup y'all country
Jonathan's hooking it up man like I'm
not gonna lie didn't know you existed
here and this is dude he just pulled all
these out of like a personal collection
for us look at that you guys said you
were hungry you said you were hungry
these all freeze-dried meals so it's
like nice and chili mac and beef it's a
crunchy dry like you add water you will
just eat it eat it and then the saliva
like makes it creates the low moisture
but you gotta add water or something no
yeah two cups of boiling water
nobody feed it just let him eat it no
you're right you're right there yeah you
could just eat it alright what do you
guys want garlic mashed potatoes yo that
was an unusual hookup I'm on a flog on
Clintonville Outfitters Columbus Ohio
all the camping all the outdoor all the
rock-climbing needs right there bro ya
know
you're gonna break the handle before my
kids do okay it's build it Brian's turn
he's gonna work this is all you do if
something goes wrong so you don't get it
it's on you do this everybody already
knows it's gonna fail but with Brian I
have a good feeling this is gonna work
this is gonna be great
it's a bust of my ability exactly
you know duct tape won't work hang on
just real quick Brian
so we purchased the wrong screws we
haven't even left just happen to think
about it I was like with this head on
this bolt I won't be able to tighten it
once I get inside here well at least we
didn't get home alright that's good no
it's good it's almost like I picked out
the bolt you strip it out bro you can
strip it out like what even this is
practice is genius that they put a test
board in here because that's for guys
like us you know what I mean like the
only way
No yes I my drilling merit badge

a Brian in their group everybody needs a
Brian does that guy look at he saves me

of a painting up but we're gonna borrow
the wall for like the next three years
so here here's like the thing we had
this giant wall up until maybe a month

desperation to use the wall we've never

one of our best dad ideas yeah it's all
about the family here we go this kids
already natural already scaling the wall
we haven't even got it started yet dude

yellow on bond you can get to that red
put your foot on the red there you go

he went all the way upstairs with it he
took a whole taco where is he in any
head Cain found him busted
he's got the whole taco look at this the
whole taco I'm just gonna say like on a
list of things that we've done like good
and bad ideas this is probably one of
the best fantastic ideas it goes all the
way to the ceiling 20 out of 10 see it's
Kane approved yeah it's double good idea
dude it looks amazing
amazing is the real test right here is
the real test the juggernaut oh my god
easy easy you know what something tells
me we should but here he goes come on
man show the world all right guys here
is what it is for now obviously we
struggled to find the pieces today and
I'm going to add to this but this is
what we're at right now and I think it's
pretty darn cool you can go all the way
to the ceiling definitely higher than I
thought it would be there you go there
you go Doris here you go Honduras dude
that's amazing it is tall like it's kind
of freaky actually but it looks so good
it looks so good
you get foot cramps tanner ring the bell
ringing my daily so cool all the way up
dude you got to touch the ceiling it's
so hard boom
so far the highest foothold is that
green peg no way you're gonna fall for
that it's so much dated made to the
ceiling good job Bryan hanging knows you
did a great job
it looks technical it looks fun oh boy
here comes our safety net you never ever
be too safe at the outlet house you got
