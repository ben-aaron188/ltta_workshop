it like two weeks ago in the mail and
I've been dying to give him this present
now I'll tell you about it once you see
it it's unbelievable so sit down do you
have enough Barbie I would do Barbie
yeah you ever know let's see it yeah we
just wrap maybe we just wrap that and
give him that that's just the all right
guys check this out so excited give this
to my brother this is such a huge gift
and you're probably gonna ask me why I'd
buy something that's nice here it is
check this out the Phantom - this is
like the most be a phantom I love it the
reason I got this for Dale is because
Dale's the one that actually inspired
the woody beat and I'll tell you a
little story about the toilet paper
prank I pulled on Howie Mandel that
prank was created by Dale calling me one
day and he said hey why don't you make
smile more toilet paper for your viewers
like toilet paper and I was like that's
kind of cool
but we looked it up and it was like
super expensive when I was like I can't
charge you guys ten dollars over and
then he was like well imagine the
commercial when we get shoot a
commercial toilet paper in your house
and I was like no I don't
I don't want to do my house but we could
toilet paper somebody else's house and
it was like five days later we were like
let's toilet paper Holly's house and
this is the actual camera that we filmed
that prank with I know it's a long story
but basically he inspired that whole
prank we filmed the prank with one of
these and he loves quad cams so I had to
get this gift but that is so awesome
he's gonna he's gonna love it I hope
he's not gonna expect it yeah they open
shoot some some stuff for me so now he's
got work to do my brother just got here
in the middle of us wrapping this look
at all the stuff it comes with those
with a brand new GoPro I can t speak no
he's not
I'm a Barbie girl in this Barbie world
wrapped in plastic
do you hear that's meowing I hope you
wanted a new cat dude I know you've been
wanting a new cat ever since our other
one guys oh you had to bring that up why
don't you trust me it's not it's not
matter trust have I really become that
guy put the face stickers in here I knew
it
did you put him up to this okay oh crap
that stuff looks real good
I've got enough land all that oh crap I
just got real high
so I'm guessing now there's there's the
funny truth I didn't know it wasn't in
there at all it must be in the case I
got you a hardshell case that's why the
case is so heavy
you have to open the case
well dusty during flight dang one of the
reasons is because the toilet paper from
this is what they use the film the exact
one and I told everybody that you're
pretty much reason we came up with that
prank it looked good so she is thank you
I'll have to believe you guys lit it
without me this is a crazy smoke ball so
cool of him let's go see it it's like
opening a bag of flaming hot cheetos
everybody look at me now run towards the
camera fast when does it stop does it
stop I'm certain think we got a problem
here it's still going the hole
it's a good night good night I think
we'd be getting you service tonight
