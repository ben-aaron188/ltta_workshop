oh I did that thing again or I forget I
do daily logs so I woke up a while ago I
dropped home and oceany it is absolutely
freezing in Toronto hence the sweat
ridge and I prep the heat because I know
my dad's gonna come home and turn her
down so while he's gone I blast that ish
up today I got a whole bunch of work to
do it is video de vídeo day so I need to
make a video gotta do some work for my
upcoming partner competition for those

to visit so I'm gonna pick him up in the
airport there's so many things to do
other than I'm gonna bend it over below
but we don't do them all the most
important thing to remember here is that
on days like this you gotta just keep
going no matter what you do do not lie
down today is one of those days today is
just one of those days where I can't
think of a video idea I don't know a
whole bunch people want me to do bottom
teeth and my deeds love story and I see
that suggested she yeah I see that
suggestion not doing it because I want
to think of a really good concept every
time you guys really want a video I
don't like to just rush and put it out I
want to think of really good concept for
that and do it properly
um and I'm just like rattling my brain
because I can't think of an idea today
it's one of those days when people ask
me to interviews how do you think of
video ideas so one of those days where I
can't I can't um and like two hours have
to leave he's used to show and I haven't
started my video yet so I might have to
like shoot it before I leave in an
editor when I come back or something I
know do you gotta know then after like

my parties and I remember when I had I
to Millie party and I invited a whole
bunch of youtubers they didn't believe I

I actually have a box filled with
positive thoughts and so I go around the

conference call in eight minutes okay
IVA commerce called eight minutes Ivan
eats up and there's my video I still
have a billion things to do but it's
okay because I want to make time to go
to use of show and just a quick mini
rant about this I try my best to support
people as much as I can because I'm a
very big believer and you got to support
people no everything's a competition and
like I feel like people are trying to
make people compete and pinch each other
against one another and I'm very like I
try to go to as many shows and other
youtubers as I can or like friends as I
can because of ended dates like I
believe one of the key success is like a
deep moment right now I truly believe
one of the keys to success iOS is
there's to actually work hard and be
nice to people and a part of being nice
to people is supporting them what they
do so Youssef did a great job he held it
down I was so happy I got to go and
support his viewers and fans the artists
were so supportive even to me being
there they're cheering and sounds a very
super cute I mean that's what spots like
support your friends support people
important to you like that support means
so much to people so it counts you know
I mean that's all I want to say that's
not always about like oh there's two
Brown youtubers three brothers or this
compare the moves bettin on and you have
to compare everyone there's enough room
for everyone succeed support people
that's all I want to say I got a
bajillion things to do so burb all right
