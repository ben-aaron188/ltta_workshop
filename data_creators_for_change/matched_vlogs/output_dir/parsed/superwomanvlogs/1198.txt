good morning someone stole my credit
card
good morning kidding I've been up for a
few hours now and I woke up to the very
pleasant news of my bank telling me that
my credit card has been compromised cuz
that's what I want to hear on this
wonderful rainy disgusting day so I've
been on the phone with the bank for
hours because someone tried to charge a
bajillion things to my credit card now
I'm dealing with that and one thing you
should know about me is I suck with
anything related to finances I know
anything about banks and finances and
money I know how to draw beards on my
face and my mom is at my door so yes mom
I'll be real I'm real I'm good I have a
decent amount of things like you know
I'm I can do some things average or
above average banking it's not one of
those things running it's not one of
those things
washing my makeup before I go to sleep
is not one of those things clearly
clearly then I wonder why I have
bajillion pimples what because you too
damn tired you don't wash your face
because bringing stupid I feel
disgusting today and that is solely
based on the fact my inbox is a disaster
I have so much work to do I've so many
emails to attend and so many things I've
just left to simmer because I've been
doing my 300 videos so today what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna wash my face I'm
gonna take a shower I'm gonna put on
some PJ's I won't be as ugly and
comfortable as possible and I'm gonna
just have a work night and to be honest
that excites me because I hate the
feeling of having a lot of work to do
especially was things like emails and
replying to like interviews and stuff I
feel dirty
I feel stanky I got stanky because of
that I just want to sit grab my laptop
grab a highlighter grab paper grab pen
