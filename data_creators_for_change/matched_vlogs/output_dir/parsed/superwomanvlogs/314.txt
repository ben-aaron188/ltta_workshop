rejuvenation Saturday maybe good
afternoon
the trend is 120 no dough into into the
past hour nothing nothing because I
slept and kind of sort another here's
what happened I had like 100 missed
calls one other who is calling me not
realizing that someone on my team called
for a person from Tesla to come to my
house and they were calling me because I
don't answer random numbers I finally
answered and so right off the bat I've
gotten my talk I'll talk higher by Taric
higher my car tire pick was a loner let
me tell you more about that in a second
but first go to the mission for today's
you almost lost measure regrouping we
are going to get my car tire what my car
tire fix did that I'm going to write
some scripts check my email I'm going to
the movies of Tia and then I'm going to
stop by Justin shoot later on today and
a bunch of other work I also want to
have some soda lots of time aside from
all of that I am just kind of
rejuvenating I slept in a little bit I'm
feeling good I'm going to go downstairs
have some breakfast can feed out my
shirt okay you're you know what's there
let's talk about this car tire story
time with levy the last night in case
you miss i vlog yesterday with a nail in
my tire that's been there for a while
came out on the highway and my tire
pitch was super super low so if I tire
with said she completely flat when I got
home and I had an appointment to go
chesil this morning which I couldn't go
to but I couldn't go so someone came to
my house to fix it here's the deal
though it's a loaner tire it's not like
a real replacement a loaner tile wasa
have style what can I not say the word
tire tired tired
let me show says I say I'm tired every
day tight but I have to return it within
three business days and they got to call
me to let me know when that can happen
because we got to see if they can
replace a tire fixed to try whatever so
I'm leaving tomorrow so I was like yo
that does it like this is another thing
to add to my dream is I have to do for
at least more can't be through business
days because also it's not a business
day today or tomorrow so I can't return
it on through business day so we're free
girl but that's the current dilemma for
now let's go let's go eat a cookie let's
go eat let's go eat some breakfast
so the other day I was on the internet
and I always see these fascinating
things that are like click this to read
this and I move my heart is weak so it
was about a whale that was near the
shores and clearly dying so they had to
shoot the whale and then scientists cut
the whale open to see why the whale died
you know was inside the window 30
plastic bag yeah because humans destroy
the planet so the 30 plastic bags as
well which is why it died and we put all
these back to display museum people come
seen as this was inside or where all
this to say we're really wasteful human
sometimes not all humans and most humans
as humanity we can be very wasteful and
so whatever it is committed to doing
right now not high in my superwoman to
do it because I've many other things to
do but it's high in my humanity to do
this and that is I keep saying it off
hangers I keep saying I had too many
clothes and you don't need calls lots of
people need clothes so I'm going to go
through my closet put a whole bunch of
clothes aside to donate them that is
what we're doing
boom come room to box of clothes set
aside give me some points although i
don't think i need points that and give
a signal log but yo you have so much
stuff usually things you don't use a
long time I'm kind of really pay
attention things I haven't using because
alright someone else could use this
thing so two box of clothes I mean very
productive mood for like doing things
that you clean that drawer actually at
some point I cleaned up since little
part of my room those bags are then like
half points I wasn't that big of a tab
and now I'm going to go fill to frame
the two posters that's a miss cool task
but still one of those things you put
off we just do that Lego
ooh per day took a shower give me the
points for hygiene I'm headed to the
movies with TIA I'm not probably taking
the theater cuz I have to hold a hundred
thousand things and you already know how
I feel about blogging with other people
so how many movies that replacement
tired oh so the good news is this list
says I still extend the loner and then I
can return it when I come back from
Toronto so crisis averted
so that movie was so good girls trip I
think all girls night before I remember
girls trip reminded me of my girls back
in Toronto I miss them so much I'm so
glad I got watch with TIA

meandher are really spiritually
connected and we share a lot of
similarities and I'm so glad I got to
see my surgeon like I even dillema I
