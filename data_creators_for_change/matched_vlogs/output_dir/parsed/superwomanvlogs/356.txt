it's the first day of summer which
doesn't really matter gonna live in LA
and every day of summer I waited my
whole life to say these words not the LA
parts of summer part good morning the
time is 12 something I'll go up a little
while ago but you know my rule I try not
to vlog before breakfast when I'm home
because I want a breakfast to myself and
kind of connect with me and not view in
front of the camera soon as I wake up
and that's how I start my vlog feeling
refreshed and awesome or these I try how
are you today hope you're wonderful I
should forget whatever is happening
today whatever might be bothering you
because it's your chance to turn it all
around or we can do it together we got a
packed pack today
here's the mission mm-hmm I've ever seen
meeting or you did it give me the point
after I script one script to shoot rent
one to rent to shoot something on a
green screen and then send a massive
amount of emails aside from all of that
I really want to focus today I know I
tried to do this everyday but I really
really want to focus on today is being
positive because last night I went to
bed feeling a little negative and I woke
up this morning being like uh kind of
not my most enthused cell someone really
focus my energies on being positive I'll
tell you why my retina saw something
beautiful happened this morning I woke
up and texted useless being like hey you
are really bad that last you missed and
we have this great bonding moment when
we feel closer to each other than ever
from alkali last night I felt like crap
because there's so many negative
comments uncle I assumed you knew we
were so rude it was so harsh and açaí so
you know though being not nice comments
to read I was like oh my god those
common convinced me that Yousef was mad
at me and so I talked in the morning and
I was just so sad and that something so
beautiful was perceived as so negative
online where I think maybe I did come
across I was dirty to the point and very
harsh that the last room was called
comfortabe has himself it definitely
wasn't my intention and house work this
morning and he was like you know what up
son I'm so glad that happened
so glad we got talked about and now
we're like really really close and so
beautiful and I wish that the comments
section of more positive realizing that
something beautiful came out of two
friends being honest but you can't win
them all and then that got me thinking
maybe feel a crap I was like yo listen
I'm trying new things with my content
I've done the ask superba live where
I've answered my favorite color and how
I started you do and why call my husband
broman I put a lot of energy and effort
into this use of live stream are really
dug into his tweets and why he does what
he does and my intention was not to be
rude or harsh I'm sorry if I came across
that way or rather yeah I don't even
know a positive warranted because he
doesn't feel that way but I trust in you
and something elected some people hated
it and that is okay it's okay
in fact maybe it's a good chance for me
to reflect on how I communicate that I
don't some people like through moving
your pen too much you're cutting them
off you're saying AHA my you guys are
really going in on me but that's okay
because I kind of went it on him - so
I've accepted it it's fine
I tried something new for those you
liked it thank you so much if you didn't
take that l and then we move on with
positivity because it's just so
beautiful just one of the main uses how
to honest conversation and it has always
been in my senses having a huge fight in
the past where I feel the articles we
used to be and I think that lies can
completely remedied it and was both
really really healthy and good for us
and made it so good so that's the
possible situation and if somebody don't
like it I apologize
and hopefully like some the other stuff
I make like the script I'm about to
write today do it so my team and I are
prepping for this video and I'm so
excited yay I'm so excited what the
content of water or buying cross and
suffer a numbered yoke but go to the car

comparing to do but like I'm willing to
spend money on this video because I'm so
excited about it my chief self was like
