couldn't come unfortunately so we had to
like makeshift with an alternative
ending but all which oh well I love it I
think it's funny I hope you like this
well not gonna lie the claves are
getting harder and harder to do because
people now are like we're in the zone of
like people switching their schedules
and like canceling on us or whatever so
we're just trying to roll with the
punches as a theme I want to make it
happen and today's gonna be good and we
have to write a bunch of scripts and do
much things I got my ninth book
Christmas tree over there but I Amazon
the ornaments particular colors using
that gift card just seeing gave me so
much Christmas true that should be
sponsored but I just bulgar probably
you so Derek took a shower here and he
forgot his jeans
honestly I'm just I'm for like tell him
to fly back to LA to pick up his jeans
real thing and sit there forever
so I'm out here telling Kyle something
so the other day I was going through my
cupboard over here I just walk into that
counter I want everyone to know this is
why I have roses
and I tried these cookies this was our
back to my house for one Richard in
class this is not a brand deal I do not
have a brand dealership Savoy but I was
just intrigued because they say red
velvet and I was like what in the actual
act so I tried one I almost had a mother
effer mental breakdown I literally
started sweating they are so stupidly
good and they need to be removed from my
house immediately reality this entire
thing and she the fattest calendar so
now you're gonna try one like do you
like red velvet to beginner um not
really
we're gonna make a nice sexual moment
sexual montage start now oh don't be so
mean
mmm how is it really though it's really
good right wait little bumpy one
haha this is like a type of goodness
where you're like you feel bad about
yourself right right right right right
right cuz what it is it's just white
chocolate chips and there's a cream
filling inside it's so damn good like
it's so Kyle was suggesting that for a
super beloved give I do some sort of
giveaway so like should I give away your
booty mm-hmm that's easy though
something that people can't get easily
I'm glad you're self-aware
that's good that's very good Kyle
weren't you just saying how you loved
being around me so much you're saying
that right you're just basically saying
how like you love working with me and
how I'm like a best it ever happened to
you right you know just talking for a
couple hours about it yeah how love
being blogged one eating the big mouth
for food mm-hmm and talking about your
booty mmhmm yeah do a sassy sip ask
superwoman live is going down this is
really awful cuz I've nine minutes left
but I have to end it early cuz I have to
poop that's the first day I so I'm
getting these internet things installed
my current dilemma is that it needs to
be plugged into these on every floor and
these are like in the middle of the wall
which means that this thing is gonna be
hanging which is so annoying
so now need to hire another contractor
to move those things lower just
essentially means cutting the wall and
then hire another person to reap atching
and painting I'm like why would they
have these in the middle of the wall
aren't they usually lower it just makes
no sense and you can just assume I'm an
amount of TV although I did but I'm also
like to point out that I had to put that
over there get installed anyways why
homeownership I'm telling you tough it's
a tough cookie you also want to open
this and we do an unboxing special
