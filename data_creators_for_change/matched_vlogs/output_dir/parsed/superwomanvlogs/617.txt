love you I don't prank people I think
pranks are horrible horrible things
I don't prank people the time is what
times 1 1:18 the night is young still
because we still got lots of Kenya this
is the story of the Kenya vlog right I
was like you all might have a week to
edit this ish it would take my time I
have this bad habit where I tell Kyle
like Kyle I don't need you to hire an
editor because I can do it Kyle look at
me I can do it because I have trust
issues I can't trust other people
editing stuff and what happens 50,000
other things that thought on my plate
every single time like Kyle we find
editor and every single time I say
before every single time he's like you
waste you'd you should have told me this
Oh what so now I've just told him to
never listen to me again I don't want
people editing my stuff but for some
girl love things because additional
stuff to what I already do it's a little
bit hard so I'm not opposed to bring on
an editor for that because there's only
so many things I can edit and do today
but yeah so this is my official wave
tongue you never to listen to me again
if I say that I mean editor because yeah
in other news I took a great poop just
now Oh lovely I was in the room he was
in the washroom with me oh she ran out
of toilet paper yeah oh yeah you know in
poopy the time has come
first of all look at this amazing
necklace they gave me since we the time
has come for me to stay up and Kyle to
go because one of us needs to be
functional tomorrow

best life in your but I think you go
live your best life
okay like I'll before you go questions
questions for Kyle's me using questions
with Kyle um where is the girl love
bracelet available where it is a ship to
everywhere that has shipping is in India
it's an India dude shall you carry we're
Trinidad US Canada UK
yes UK um all the places that you guys
are and what what do you think how is it
gender neutral do you feel proud where
yours yes it's a very gender neutral
it's actually blue not pink mm-hmm as
the girl love would imply yes and you
should know that the inspiration already
mentioned is in the vlogs if I did they
just pretend like it's the shock but
well as a phone having a conversation
about the colors was like I wanted to
look like something Khaleesi would wear
from Game of Thrones
that was my description so Khaleesi
probably would endorse this product as
well just gonna put that out there and
put that out there but more than
anything
kyle endorses it and
that's I don't endorse things lightly
that's right he doesn't have any
products want me to endorse their
product a lot a lot of that whole lot a
lot of them okay you see the amount of
company that sells give him underwear to
pop model in but he refuses okay bye
now I'm just procrastinating by hey
Kyle's gone I'm so tired I don't wanna
do this
honestly I just there's too many things
happening in a day and I'm dying and I
can't like I can't do it okay
I can't do this anything I can't do this
many things all day I really want to
release this right now though I think
I'm gonna go to sleep because I can't do
this
puh-leeze what do I look like some sort
of Nam boss and that I'm gonna stay up
almost every night if I have to this can
you block is not only going up it's
gonna go up
spectacularly and if that's not a word
it is now leg out
the time is 403 I am done waiting for to
render and then a God knows how long
it's gonna take to upload because the
video is 15 minutes and two gigs and I'm
on hotel Wi-Fi and I'd be ready to leave
at 8:45 for the event tomorrow so I got
four hours and 45 minutes before we
leave
um no gotta bus candy that's been
keeping me up this whole time I like the
video I'm I don't I'm glad I spent this
long doing it I didn't cut any corners
how many hours we'll see where I started
got here like 11 it's for what's the
math you'll five hours I estimated five
hours to plus the two hours on the plane
so seven seven ish hours I like it I
think are you frozen I like it um yeah I
like it a lot actually I'm really proud
of myself and I'm really part of this
whole campaign I don't keep talking
about over and over again but I know I
don't know how to explain it and I don't
want to sound preachy the like how can
we I just don't get how we can be
presented with opportunities to help
people and not take them you know what I
mean like maybe something in Kenya very
much so change me but like school people
don't get to go to school you know that
that breaks my heart and like it is
amazing that organizations like me do we
exist that think of ways to fix those
problems it's one thing to feel bad
about it's another thing to do something
about it and they've just done such an
incredible job I'm so honored to be
partnering with them through their we
day events or through any of the other
stuff they do it's just so great so if
you at all like from the bottom I heart
I don't
I wonder imagine I don't get any of the
money from these bracelets not even a
single cent goes to me it's not about
that this is about we didn't come
together and do something great if you
have $15 spirit spend it on this spend
it on this this is frozen it's for 21
