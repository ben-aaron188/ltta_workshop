good morning I just woke up from a nap
because I if you watched yesterday's
vlog you know I pulled an all-nighter
editing and my sister gave birth to a
healthy beautiful baby boy her third one
and I've not seen yet cuz I was sleeping
also because we can't go to the hospital
but I'm headed to her house very shortly
but let me tell you about what's
happening first
I'm so tired they're going up the stairs
wouldn't did me so let me tell you what
I were working so hard on okay I just
been working hard on nuttin this is my
master plan today super Thursday right I
released a video on Monday so I'm gonna
make up for it with oh please know that
very little sleeper yeah yes bear with
me my master plan is everybody these
days talk about diss tracks Meek Mill
and drag and good a little bit some of
yo I have a wicked idea I'm gonna make
bottom jeath make a diss track about
Lilly right but how am I gonna promote
this like I know what I'm gonna give
everyone a scare I'm gonna make it seem
like it's legit I'm basically about to
post a status right now convincing
people with this picture that my YouTube
account got hacked I'm not a prankster
but I'm really excited I'm gonna set my
YouTube account got hacked i order you
to unified I've already notified YouTube
that it hasn't gone hacked not to take
any action because I know some of my
fantasies as you lovely see this you're
probably gonna be like sending Ravens to
you to be like yeah again so I've made
it seem like someone got my password
it's been hacked and that there's no
super Thursday video but that one gets
uploaded it's gonna seem like someone
else upload the videos gonna be bottom
jeath with a diss track against me come
on I'm so excited I kill that let me
just write this up hold up hold up I
feel evil doing this but you guys as
soon as I upload the video in a couple
hours I'm only gonna let you panic for a
couple hours you'll see why it just adds
to the video so much because in the
beginning bottom sheets like changing my
password and all that stuff so it's not
a creative way I hope no one's bad about
it I don't think you should be mad at
but I think it's really funny but it's
the caption I never thought I'd say this
and it absolutely breaks my heart to
type this it seems that someone has
managed to hack my YouTube account and
change my password just reading that
like even though it's fake is Gary I
cannot explain how Dev
did I am right now I've already
contacted contacted YouTube and they're
working on it right now with all their
effort even though I'm freaking out I
don't want anyone to panic I have faith
in humanity if you see any activity on
my channel please tell me ASAP its link
to my Twitter so should be easy to keep
an eye out so when I tweet the video
you'll see it I will not sleep until I
sort this ugh whoever has my channel

please I'm I'm sorry if there's no super
Thursday video ready okay here we go
Facebook Twitter Tumblr are you ready to
stir some chaos right here ah it's out
exact I'm so sorry for freaking you up

purpose that it's all with the creative
purpose alright there's only been a
couple of minutes um cm this QT team
super UK is like analyzing my playlists
being like people changing your plays no
one's changing my playlist it's always
been like that and the best part is
someone is claimed that they've hacked
my account now my eye dark blue eye eye
it says that people are saying this
person claims it hacked account on if
it's truth I'll let you know um so
that's just a little insight into how
the world works cuz clearly this person
didn't hack my account but the people
things will do things people do for
attention though this is oh this is
gonna be an experiment and a half
experiment and a half okay so I haven't
even talked with my friends this is all
my friends are messaging you freaking me

dressed like fuck I feel most bad that
you guys are stressed but I'm confident

Tina's house today yeah Tina's Oster day
so I'm headed home and I just realized
in the excitement of the baby and then
the whole video thing you never happen I
didn't upload a serious look and I have
to do that now because just gone so I'm
gonna go home and upload yesterday's
vlog um cool no okay I swear to god I'm
not biessing right now my heart is
friggin racing I'm home alone and I
definitely hear something upstairs I
swear to god I'm not freakin playing
right now I have worked in this room for
nights at a time and I've never heard
anything like that before like so much
that I just locked my door like it
sounded like an animal so I'm like okay
maybe there's raccoons or something but
the things I'm in the basement so the
next level up is my main floor so snark
is the Attic I swear to god I sound like
things running back and forth yet I'm
vlogging about I'm not doing anything
are even message my I would message my
parents okay I didn't have a weapon
breaking with me stand by
I swear to god team super if you're
playing a joke on me this is not funny I
literally have my lights off because
there's two-way glass in my room so I
can look outside
I call my dad I welcome out these are my
sisters
and he's like maybe it's a mouse or
something like it sounded pretty bigger
that'll break your mouse I'm confident
that had to be an animal cuz I heard up
there and over there which means it must
have been something in the walls or
something I have no frickin idea I want
to like carry a weapon with me and I
know there's a weapon upstairs but I
need to get upstairs I don't know how to
Oh
so it's several hours later I'm okay I'm
fine I'm sorry for freaking you out I
was genuinely so scared likes okay my
case just came off my laptop so scared
you weren't not scared I was I'm still
scared I basically locked myself in my
parents room right now I'm pretty she
was like a raccoon or there's some
animal in the walls but at first thing I
thought it was a person like I was
freaked the F out so what I did was
after just standing there for 20 minutes
I didn't have anything in the room so I
literally brought a tripod carried it
like a bat up until I found this bat and
I walked on my whole house with his bat
and I'm gonna sleep with his bat and the
doors are locked like that so scared I'm
right now like holy crap but it's been
several hours later I'm calmed down I'm
convinced it was just a there's an
animal on the walls or something mmm in

desk talk why is my desk talk why is my
desktop my room I got so my desktop
