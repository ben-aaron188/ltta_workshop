far from RIT so I'm gonna head over
there cuz boat it was talking about
subway non-stop on street so I'm going
get myself like a delicious feast of
everything I'll be I have no
idea there was a stab right there Oh
Venus level is over 9000 there's my
subway there's my local shop and I know
I'm Starbucks yeah sure if police chase
or a news traffic anyway she's going
down someone first all right I made it
to HD but a dick and the plan of action
now is to basically rule on in here and
try and find myself a table and chairs
now this glass table right here is
pimpest chips I not this the one that
that table is really really dumb nice
but I think it might just be a bit too
big however I am going to need a coffee
table and this might be the best one
I've ever seen that is so damn cool Doge
Doge Doge doh
okay this is getting creepy now I see so
many fucking dogs alright if that was if
that was been creepy ah definitely is do
you ever feel like just buying pairs of
hands
have you ever felt like shopping for
light bulbs because this place has
pretty big bulbs and dogs
lots of dogs and like weird mini looking
horse dogs I was like oh that's a nice
van and then I realized this guy was
chillin on the inside like the fuck well
this is the exact table but I want the
style it's very civilian very small but
glass-top stay on the still bomb I don't
fuck around when I know I want something
I know exactly what I want I go in look
for it spot it find it purchase it leave
save the day time entertainment tell me
to fuck I'm so fed up of this not being
long enough and there is an easy way for
me to fix this it requires is for me to
go in here turn this light on get these
extra ones and put them up with it just
like that it's pretty much done until I
know I said it one thing wrong so as you
see there's a gap here so like there's
four coatings basic glue up

on the wrong way around

no exhausted after for you I had no
stood ladders so I did like jump up on
the ledge up and down up and over down

yes so basically she was like why is
that guy filming it
but yeah you can just like you all sit
down here
so Jimmy clip plenty it looks good and
then a little drunk friend from another
party you kick a rock we're all
reminiscing about like what happened
overnight and Luke had no idea how
blackout drunk II was so I'm going to
show him a quick photo and embarrass him
dearly this game looks awesome
I found out about this game if you go
get the ball into the growing mold you
know like what are we do it you gotta
sneak it through but you can get it to
the tempo you get a free drink from the
bar which is fucking brilliant
I'm lucky
Oh help
recomm this is my first time
like that don't you
you got his first one I didn't hold
no the retreat
no saved it saved it I saved it
got a natural
no you're done going in three jars
telling you Italian this thing it's
wrecked absolutely it's rigged 500 times
a trick for I love this big that much am
i buy one of these for my apartment in
LA
it's the perfect feature now if you guys
recognize this game not because you're
old but if you've ever listened old red
ready player one Galaga is a massive
reference in it so my first ever game on
Galaga I didn't do too good so we'll try
again beat the high score of 296,000 ok
yeah maybe I'm a good bina the shuttle
relays have toys inside
is awesome
I told about yeah this is like a gaming
nerdy bar which is cool as shit but then
I notice one thing always sure I just
got second place high score on this game
yeah super runnin swing just saw Luke
get up and drop it's white on the floor
so we got a cunning plan to prank woo
I'm gonna be like oh no my card got to
client I need money to get taxi home
at which point we're going to let in
planet I'm going to film it for about
10-15 minutes and then wound up giving
him back
or will we he'll Luke Luke it looks like
you don't have any of your bank cards or
money therefore I have several set of
games you have to get a high score in
every single game to get a credit card
back
I don't have it and you can take my
headphones I have five more beds at home
bye Luke
love you my flashbang don't most tell
you what there's some feeling you move
from one still even Alec fuck smoke
yo I'm saying is that Luke used to have
the best beard now you do casual
everybody home time in my book of course
yeah the day I would decide to fly my
dad out to LA tomorrow it rains the
night before it's like a sign it's a
sign of bad luck that my dad is bringing
the literal rain
okay-dokey show the TV that I'm looking
at getting with the stun TV with stoned
is 48.9 by 30.8 okay remember this okay
okay so like that size right there is
the TV of a 55 inch so it would fit in
quite perfectly but we might be able to
stretch to a 60 inch because the height
difference is completely fine all it
matters is about the width the width the
width the height and the width so if the
whip can fit it in we might go for a 60
inch final measurements for a 60 inch
which is fifty three point seven inches
so let's see if it will fit so I get it
books now and paid for we have a 60 inch
4k TV there in all its glory
ah I've got some packages may wanna want
out what are this what it is I got a
what is this a 4k 120 gigabytes SSD card
which is my g7x which could mean that I
am tempted to move away from filming
with my iPhone to an actual camera the
chances of that happening are very slim
but just in case I got a micro SD card
ultra - recording 4k as well for GoPros
so I can travel around with a little
mini backpack on all the time with my
cameras in it for my daily vlogging and
a laptop but at the same time I much
prefer my phone so let me know with one
like rating whether or not I should try
vlogging with the g7 X if this video
gets over 50,000 like ratings I will do
a vlog with the g7 X like the really
good camera and we'll see if I like it
and stick to it but for the main event I
decided to go ahead
and get a set scale so I'm just gonna
try getting on it again it says it's
sensing stare off okay thinking okay by
the way it was like a few pounds just by
changing my buttons all right well
that's more weight one forty seven point
one twelve percent point four body fat
I don't wanna that's good or not and tg6
or judge yourself okay so I have eleven
percent body fat twelve set body fat I
don't know if that's good or bad if
there is any healthy people out there
who know whether or not that's good or
bad please let me know in the comments
down below thanks that workout and I'll
start busting a workout but as far as I
know I think I'm alright
I gave it a googol and that said I am
abnormal weight if not healthy weight so
my days have we just read them with
eating shit shit shit are somehow paying
off great success oh I'm so happy my
dad's just rang me this is probably this
