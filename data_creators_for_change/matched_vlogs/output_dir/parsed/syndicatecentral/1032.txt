playstation coming out as green when it
shouldn't be blue what am I doing wrong
oh you guys better be excited I just had
an amazing derice run or the giant
theories it's called the theories but
look at that csgo gambling with my skins
again I don't know I'm doing this it's
all kicking off in Paris again
apparently they've managed to track and
locate the guy who's behind the Paris
bombings so I've been editing gambling
and tracking this shit hopefully this
gets wrapped up and no one gets hurt so
yeah stay tuned domain channel guys this
bad boy should be if you're watching us
now this should be out but basically
this is really good gameplay honestly
really really good zombie footage so I
like messing with my cell but I cannot
stop showing it off because I fucking
love it oh I thought about them little
touches my neighbour Juggernog fridge
minecraft so little pop figures by the
way I think this this one is my second
favorite and this one barley Wow is my
favorite this is pretty I'm gonna make a
collection that bigger that it goes like
up the wall I think I might get like a
unit like like actually fits this entire
space from like IKEA just filled with
them
move that to that oh I totally forgot I
had an extra one yeah that is brilliant
I am trying my sweet asbestos nests that
makes sense that's English to empty
these boxes and get rid of all of them
so I can get a new couch and then this
couch here I might even go and point my
office but I'm never gonna say it so I
might get rid of it and by the way if
you don't have a wristband thing of any
sorts I highly recommend this I have
talked about it non-stop the raisin a
boo is so god damn good if you're gaming
and you got your headset on so you know
like you're just in the zone if you like
you know your parents ring your some
rings you like you need to do something
or your lamb goes off this frame
vibrates when you're gaming like rather
than you not being our Tara and you
berate to whatever you need to go to or
you miss an important phone call I have
been so much more organized with this
having this let me know that my phone's
ringing awesome what's going on and I
know it totally sounds like I've been
paid to say this but I am genuinely not
I'm always do you guys have something
sponsored I'll say this is sponsored
video but this is not sponsored video
this is in fact just a really cool piece
of tech if you want a Christmas gift I
would highly recommend this you
obviously tracks all like you steps
you're asleep which is really good like
if I wake up when it says I've had less
than eight hours sleep I just go to
backwards bet on my clock this and I
feel fresh is anything but honestly like
treacherous steps calories you know all
that when you're active in doing running
and shit like that it tracks all of that
but for me the most important thing is
if someone's ring give me it vibrates
that's that's what I'm using this bar
I'm using a gaming fitness band for that
guess it's doing its job no I have more
this is what I had no idea I had more oh
well let's go and put Daryl Dixon that
looks nothing like that on the actual
account deals let's go and put Daryl
Dixon onto the pile of these these are
pop figures by the way they covered a
lot of the loot crate's
so I'm just like continuing my
collection that was do I need a kettle
I need a kettle so I can be Brooklyn in
the drama film and so I can be British
and drink
PG tipps I could potentially just put
water in the microwave boy that's not
British enough I need to be a hundred
and ten percent British but I'm doing a
good job right now of rifling through
stuff this resistor is the people that
makes it look like there's more stuff

any battery kind of like lost the
charger for it oh my god oh my god no

been on this in like months it probably
sounds like aids downstairs for the
neighbors which so I'm not gonna do that
and it's 11 o'clock at night so just

office the entire building off see this
