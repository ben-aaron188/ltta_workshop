I definitely feel like this is a
familiar situation with me sat in the
best car ever from getting to a to be
what you choose smash I know right I
thought you choose so my dad came in and
woke your cuz I just got the new iPhone
6 at my Tawaf for some reason she didn't
wake me up whatsoever like it's the
first time I've used it since I've got
the phone - well Ken's just cold what we
all is like I thought we got America and
I'm like I have time to fly one for me
what time is it now fine Michael
four minutes past 1:00 so we're now
using the swag mobile to hold for try
and get to the airport as fast as
possible I have no bikes to check in I
have checked it online and I should be
able to just like go straight through
fingers cross ball or we could say
fingers crossed so if I miss it I miss
it but all six off fingers crossed
thanks Ken you've looked everyone
everyone down in the comments legend Ken

into and say hello it's quite cute I
know yeah
he's a Twitter famous guy GX dot on
Twitter go and show him some love
that's my way of making him happy too so
he doesn't kick me on the car right now
just saying there is no way I just
managed to get here in time there's the
line for the freakin plane my dad flew
to the airport best taxi driver ever
so honestly go show my dad someone's
book like I got to the check-in and he
said everyone but now you've missed it I
was like I've got nobody to check I
carry hand luggage and I've got my
ticket already and you were like oh
actually you're okay
the Hassan Salameh
versatile
yes
in trouble
if kids can take photos be incited here
so can i what an awesome set of stuff I
was just like is there any chance I
could get a photo in the cockpit and
they said yes

do a bit of a blog in there but then I
was just like thanks guys anyway I
selfie with us like yeah sure I took a
selfie with that as well

forces come on Joe that goes there
that's supposed to be good job good job

I think one of those difficult things
about flying is trying to pick the
snacks for the flight there's so much
options so many options but so little
time I've got like 20 minutes to pick so
it's gonna be a tough thing but I'm
thinking chocolate and crystals there's
a Starbucks at the airport so if you can
take a wild guess of what I'm doing to
get soon as I'm heading to LA and I
always get it in LA oh my god I've just
remembered I get to use my floor deck
when I get back to life yes
take a guess right now as to what I'm
having
chocolate milk with ice I was like a
pound right hell yeah I'm fine I'm a

always get on this plane so I know it's
going to be the brand-new modern one
