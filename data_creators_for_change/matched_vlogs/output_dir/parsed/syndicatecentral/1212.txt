there's a bonus thing for anyone's it
online what we're gonna do is carry on
opening the pokemon cards and then
giving them away as well so I'm gonna
sign them so if you want it go and watch
the last video the start of it where I
talk about the details of me giving away
pokemon cards of me signing them just
cuz I thought opening Pokemon cards was
formed because as a kid it was kind of
exciting to do and we'll try
thundershowers are all right you might
even continue this series of the roads
fine Charizard Pokemon is just gonna
think it's crap a lot of money up next

for no reason cuz I never got one as a
kid
alright so we've got a trainer mister
last pack by the way we got a trainer

got an energy that's the first card of
them I've got I got a purloined I got
the weirdest thing ever as a shiny
I got a mush na a befo before my lunch
we've got one of them already got a
super scooped up and a low MA and a
climbed which looks like a gear so
that's pretty much everything of my cars
I'm just gonna get all the shiny ones

know that shine is it the best so I've
got some pretty good shinies I'm pretty
stoked about everything to get there

each pack gara did that I got CAD looks
sick it's called AK I got X if someone
could tell me if that cog Rx is any good
that'd be awesome gonna meet each pack
comes with a shiny so let's go that was
a stadium card I'm sure I got this one
out of here yeah yeah sorry
yeah I attempted about 20 pot when it
pops up a notification saying there's a

all of them so these all together now if
I wish that still my old pokémon other
pokémon cards I did last time so there's
the pokemon cards I've got which I'm
going to sign and I'd say he's probably
like 75 there maybe 100 that I am gonna
you know go through and sign all
individually all right syndicate all
them and post them it's gonna cost me a
bit of money book and I'll put all the
information in this
should've held together my shine is
these ones that I put up for special
prizes and a special way to win them
because just for the lawls so the shine
is that we got we've got a keg R X which
can't the cad feels amazing is it's like
the best card you can get now or
something because it feels like it okay

we've done and like I said I'm gonna be
signing them I got like four sharp is
that I'm gonna go let's go take me

try and fill out all the details cuz I'm
gonna have to get like 100 envelopes for
each what we have to do that like 100
envelopes but I don't know just a bit

signature that I do and like maybe a
