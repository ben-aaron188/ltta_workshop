ah this was supposed to be daily why no
daily because things were happening with
their details behind this channel at the
moment so can I just had to stop because
I didn't know if I could upload or I
couldn't upload anymore what's this
channel I could've done on the main
channel but I don't know I kind of like
this my blogging channel so what's up
rose we're at plus Rosalie I never call
you browse to it when did I turn into
pooty-poo
robust yeah just someone sent me that
last night the insert brofist here sort
of thing but anyway I am here and if you
didn't see on Twitter which I'm sure
you've most of you did because you all
follow me on Twitter
I bought these ice broke the box Pokemon
cards now I don't play pokemon I never
play pokemon in my life and I never got
how to play pokemon i wish i could play
pokemon but I'm more of a person who's
interested in the I'm like the person
who reads the book and then goes I
really just like images so I prefer like
pop-up books and stuff I bought anyway I
decided I wanted to we did this when was
the last time we did this like before
Christmas we did this last I mean Kate
did this last time before Christmas and
this time I decided that I'm gonna do it
the proper way because last time I
bought this big these big boxes okay and
the big boxes came with these packets
which had set cards in them so and I
actually knew exactly what I was gonna
get they were starting decks in my black
Tom how do you know all this I basically
read the information on the back of the
box today while stirring Walmart and so
basically all the clouds that had we're
set so what I'm gonna do is I bought one
of each of the new style packs ok so but
I bought like 10 of them okay so these
are awesome I don't know what they all
do and these little different ones this
one and if someone's like what you'll do
them afterwards sharpies I'm gonna sign
them I don't know how many cards is
gonna be here but I'm actually gonna do
is if you send me a YouTube message with
your address and name an information
obviously I'll probably like I'll fill
out like a form of how you should send
me your information and
from below I'm gonna go to the post
office and I'm gonna send every single
one of these cards signed with sharpies
in different colors to anyone who wants
to signs think of me same syndicate
maybe like a little drawing something
that makes any sense but yeah so I've
said that on Twitter in everyone's like
you know I freaking love one of them so
hey why not I'm probably going to spend
like five hundred dollars sending people
sad pokemon cards which is just
absolutely great and the cats being
stupid I'm sorry this one the first one
I'm gonna bucks is dark explorers that's
what it's called black pokemon black and
white duck explores
I should do this like nerd voice I can't
get hit in it you'll have to use a key
for this alright so the first pack we
get we're going to emboss it
this is cats just Oh get off the cat's
like I'll unbox it with my tooth
all right so can you see that the couch

so I'm gonna box this first one and
we're gonna see what we can get because
