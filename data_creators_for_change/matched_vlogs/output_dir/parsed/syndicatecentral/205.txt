laptop for an hour and it in the vlog
I guess welcome your faces to a brand
new day because it is past midnight it's
a new dawn it's a new night time avoid
is edited now to start the render day
zero and boy oh boy do I wish I brought
my beast of a PC with me as good as this
laptop is it's not as good as my PC so
this is gonna take a while to render
well my laptop it's all gonna take it 11
minutes oh you know what laptop you good
oh I got up in the night to check my
render and it crashed at 1337 great
you've gotta be kidding me you know I
was doing my video of low cool this is
how i pipe my bug and everything well it
was how I pack my bag what if I gonna
forgot I bloody left my toiletries my
toothbrush my toothpaste my hair gel I'm
a deodorant everything I'm gonna stink
okay
even though it is a new dawn and it is a
new night I need to see you guys in the
morning so let's get that day of
insomnia 62 I'm starting it off with an
amazing start I've only had like
literally three and a half hours sleep
to the point where I finally got to bed
about 3:00 a.m. I woke up at 7 and I've
got me on to get much sleep since
however I managed to get one of these
bad boys which came with a little
toothbrush and a little toothpaste
another lovely day in England oh my I
still don't even know if Brian
Terrorizer actually made it and in a
weird other thing to bring up I
mentioned some drama yesterday you guys
probably heard by now
mini lads dog passed away he may be
caught in his so many a trip short
to go back home turns out I'm not the
only one he couldn't sleep Tom and I
couldn't sleep
this guy kept sending me dick pictures
all night luckily not is but actually I
don't know if there's a better thing I
know I get a drink down me back to bed
Oh either yeah what'd you bring in Oh
Terrorizer shirts we got terrorizes here
he is hi there those to see you okay bro
now say a massive thank you to everyone
the previous insomnia who donate into
the charity box that we've got so if
