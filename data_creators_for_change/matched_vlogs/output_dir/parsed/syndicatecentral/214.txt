complaining about my vlogs being late my
streams being bad quality this this this
the fact that I can't even live stream
in my house
at the same time of someone being on
their phone sending snapchats someone
watching Netflix or any that shit it
drives me crazy I finally decided on a
direct line internet to my house and I
just found out from BT today well I
ordered it reversion but they had to
hire BT to do it
so BT is installing a button pain
version to do it so anyway got an email
today saying on by the 27th of this
month which is still really far away I'm
gonna find out when the installation is
going to take place because they have to
rip up my entire Road an entire other
Road a massive cross-section of bus
lanes all to just get me one into the

every single person on my roads gonna
get like super fast in there there it's
got they're all gonna benefit I was
thinking they might do yet no they're
gonna rip up my entire road for one
cable for me I'm okay with that
like I've been complaining for years and
years and years that it's just bullshit

brand-new boost of a PC and stream in
