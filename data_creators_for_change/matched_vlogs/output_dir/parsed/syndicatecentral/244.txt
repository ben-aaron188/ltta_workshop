this is literally helms time' day to do
the tango why is this a thing a lot of
people like tone did you get that hickey
off with you if you think that's a key
yeah I don't think you've ever kissed on
your neck before cuz that's a spot and
I'm definitely picked in the hotel and
yeah we're we're running an hour later
checkout so that's that so in between
Lydia putting her makeup on I'm going to
attempt to try the damning ramen crisps
that the people dropped off yesterday so
smells strong tastes that definitely
came out my mouth
thanks I don't know actually yeah I
definitely could have guess what that
tastes it tastes like sesame oil flavor
oh nice but they leave one hell of a
weird taste in your mouth
alright mmm it's kind of like lingering
Wow
now time to try some premium brewing tea
but it looks like a bottle of water I
don't think I'm supposed to mix it with
anything oh I don't know I think you
might be able to add milk to it but okay
smells like team and tastes like tea
tastes like tea next on the agenda is
orange lucozade from Hong Kong I'm
pretty sure I just said Japan earlier
which I hope I didn't on the back of it
they have a weird logo with a guy
pointing a finger what smells pretty
damn good I can't tell if it tastes good
and I don't know the wrote it that's
because I ate them crisps and I've got
that weird aftertaste in my mouth ball
doesn't really taste like Luke is it
just tastes like orange water but that
is the cutest sized bottle of lucozade
I've ever seen thank you very much for
them this guy's the logo they have on
their drinks I don't know if we have
that in the UK but never seen that
before I don't think oh whether or not
that was supposed to be a sad emoji in
there as well well that's pretty cool
what was in my case next on the tasting
agenda is a bag of stuff I feel like
I've had this book would you cut a
Japanese version I generally have a
weird feeling that
I'm tryna is actually Japanese not
Chinese even though I'm in Hong Kong but
mmm tell you that is incredible yucky
yucky so yeah yakisoba flavor oh my god

I'm assuming it's a shrine of sorts if
you look up look at the detail in it I'm
not too sure what's going on with the
hair but I really like it
what's the symbol in the hand sure
actually pretty dang old Phillips screws

idea but sure wild ogo is walking around
everywhere

picturesque in it and you know what if I

so much like warmth internally and
Happiness up like that I love it I love
it

coming from I guess people are allowed
to hit the drums I'm pretty sure I'm
actually pretty sure there is big signs

not something you know what scratch that
I'm gonna design my house dog like that
no modernist no well actually super
modern on the inside it looks like that

moment feels magical on the innocent to
this amazing sculpture to this now it's
time for the big drums
everyone's been playing tunes and stuff
like this on it but I'm just gonna beat
it three times each it was worth playing
on the drums and lighting incense cuz

died in my garden I want maybe not that
big not that big but and I just love it
it makes me so happy to look at it's
beautiful it's not just it's not just a

talking about 15 this is the hoodie the
suprem hoodie cuisine cuisine is where
we're trying it now and for the record
I'm not famous awareness for the sake of
when don't wear it supreme it's just
crazy I like I'll go through how much
everything cost me when I get back to
that like the new hotel we're at like
yeah but like I know clothing this is
actually a really good quality like I'm
telling you it really is there was a
ripple it's really good material let's
just not talk about these these tussles
don't like it this is a really nice
restaurant wait now it's 9 o'clock
that's about starlight
still Watsa please thank you now where
we're eating right now is the hotel we
bins Dana but we're not actually staying
here against that because however we
need final hotel because like 9 o'clock
at night they've currently got our bags
downstairs but we're gonna eat at the
restaurant bill because it's nice we
can't be a stress around looking for
anywhere else but what I was just about
to say as I started this is a you know
what's weird like some people really
don't have a problem like wearing fading
store we're in this I genuinely feel
like judged especially I think any
anything that's supposed to be like
expensive Brandon : sort of thing and in
a place where a lot of its fate gets
churchand anyway you know even if it's
real people have robbed alike that's
fake you know so he's kind of like that
but like when I'm walking around this in
my pocket and no that's real I bought
about the jeer like I feel pride with
this because I just a little bit having
his beautiful like his back like it was
a big decision or something like this I
had called this hoodie for about ten
pounds like it's ridiculous don't you're
wrong I know it's even if it didn't have
that it like I got a hoodie for ten quid
but like say you can get a fake hoodie
patina I know you can get them cheap on
eBay and stuff like that but like I was
haggling with them and still Pete was
just a really fun experience and I'll
show you my entire outfit my entire
supreme out there the only thing I
didn't get was like shorts on jogging
jogging bottoms the swimmer but most of
copied entire haggled fakes you beam out
of it I think it was a really fun
experience I really enjoyed it but then
when I put it all and I was like wow
this just doesn't feel right like I
don't know it that even if it was real
how would it be aware in any way but I
was just like so about this just a ride
yeah I feel like everyone's looking at
you like you stand out like a circle I
only walked from the corner but two
seconds and that guy came into view
I'd like I sat down that guy was like I
should room it was like I'm gonna fall
okay sure you saw how he planned out
just so we hold the goddamn phone I did
not mean thousand I mean that's 128
British pounds in 80 pens oh that's
expensive for a stuffed book you know
what these menus are getting weird
chilly read this properly chilled
jellyfish with pork there and marinated
pork trotters no I can tell you what
we're not going bird's nest after today
no thank you I don't care what it was
bird's nest is made with spit no but
someone did put it like this to me
though on Twitter
oh you don't like birds spit but you eat
an egg out of a bird's vagina I was like
guys got pine but then again there's a
difference between
no no okay some some countries eat like
and I guess the chickens period okay
yeah I hate this conversation
some people eat like eggs that have
almost developed into little chickens
and then let them go off and it's like a
fermented egg and it's like a delicacy
in some countries now we feast oh dude
I'm having like a meltdown
this pork belly is so good and so crispy
now might be the best Pope ever I'm
alive we're trying to book a hotel over
in Macau but we can't book a hotel Macau
because there's only three available and
they're like 700 pounds a night two-star
Hotel
yeah that's not must be my booty this
book it's just expensive this talking
like hell no I must put it up with my
own fucking hotel for tonight so the
options are we either try and stay here
for another night always staying Hong
Kong for another and then go over there
well I think is even if we go over there
pretty much everywhere fully booked up
with five days so we don't know we're
gonna do the show
do you do do you know what we'll do by
the way is actually it's nearly
half-past 10:00 at night if we still
don't you still got a hotel booked for
the night there's Thomas
whatever I've got to add insult to
injury the guy just asked as if we want
to put it on our room go out on the
streets things place closes at like half
time never had a home they don't go home

where we're staying tonight homeless and

we managed that because every other
person would not budge at all but that

to get myself the t-shirt for 8 pounds
and then for 10 pounds I managed to get
the supreme hoodie of which by the way
you heard that the disc downstairs the
guy was like oh that looked real and I
was like yeah it kind of does because it
was just hooded with the supreme stitch
on it so why would it not be real but
nonetheless managed to get this for like
a tenner this one eight quid I was like
hell yeah by the way these prices may be
wrong by like a pound or so but that's
pretty much the case then rolls look we
managed to get this hat now excuse me
I'm pretty sure I went up to someone and
asked for a hat like this and they were
like 180 and I was like hell no get the
hell out of it but a lot no what do
other people they weren't wanting to
sell it to me
managed to secure this hat walked up to
this other person I said this hat how
much and she was like nightly I was like
I give you 50 for right now cash let's
walk out and then she was like yep
hundred of the money well after she
didn't like it
like don't want to I was like Evan we
got 50 she was fine and then I sold it
to so I got that for a fiver
not bad next up managed to get this bad
boy for a no joke you saw me bartering
for this she was I think what 86 for it
and I just joked around with her to the
point where I felt bad and I paid like
40 for that so I paid 4 pounds for this
and then on to the shoes I managed to
somehow like I don't understand like the
quality of how they sell things here I
know my black wait what
but I managed to get the bag which is
like the biggest item for a hundred yeah
and then like everything
she liked part it's way out the hoodie
was more expensive than the bag but then
what I couldn't understand stop is that
there's more materials that go into the
shoes then there is the bag and I
managed to get the shoes for like 15 so
like sorry 15 quids or 150 now again a
lot like this a soup room but it says
soup really so don't laugh at me I only
got them to complete the set I will
admit though I didn't see any other
shoes to buy that said supreme because I
don't think supreme really do a lot of
trouble shoes that is completely wrong
because I'm really not into all this
sort of clothing but yeah I got up at 15
so you know what everything here was
pretty goddamn solid and more last but
not least actually my favorite thing of
the without a doubt the supreme phone
case
now this surprisingly this cost fight
this this should cost like 10 but they
were just not selling to anyone less
than like 60 so I managed to get this
it's at 50 which is 5 pounds you know
compared to like I'm actually at the hat
for it I mostly get that hat for 50 but
managed to get the supreme case I don't
actually know what that brand is there
but - get the supreme in this for 50 and
it's actually a good case like you can
buy these anywhere so like that's a good
case in itself and the fact that it just
happened to be soo premium was like okay
this goes with the meme so you know what
all in all there's Mahal's supreme your
tits out boys we got it hooked up we got
it fight style for a total of like I
don't know what I said like I think we
mean Lydia like calculate it is like 65
British pounds not bad
650 Hong Kong dollars a default or with
a random stranger who was like yo that
is lesser than the titty wanted to
follow with me very impressed with that
situation literally all we just put on
the clause and the guy was like oh my
god soup room could I get a photo and I
was like you damn right you can and then
for the hungry downstairs to be like so
pretty my like I thought it was real
doing wrong could be lying but at the
same time I really don't think he was
because he were talking about like you
must be well-off or something because
like wearing Superman I had the supreme
bag and the thing is it was like if you
wear fake stuff I guess some people just
have to own it but like yeah I don't
think I could wear something fake and be
like yet real
I couldn't do it I just couldn't do it
but that was the whole successful I'm
now go getting in the bath
