thank you for the service of driving be
mother appreciate you so it's a door
service and I like it that's what
troubles my boy it's only been a sweet
week since I've been able to collect it
it's time to get it however I'm supposed
to be waiting for someone in this room
there's no one there so I might just
have to buy this in the mean time I was
really hoping this was gonna be a pop in
pop out sort of thing but it's not so
when I get myself a drink - well I'm
talking about love it absolutely love it
I'm gonna need something to wake me up
simply because they had about two and a
half hours sleep we have a dinner date
with Lydia's aunty which means so -
pepper chicken don't mind if in the back
looking all nice we've got in the garage
today is that which is a project seven
which is there's only 250 of them in the
world
the guy bought it for 130 grand it's now
for sale 450 so he's making money on it
and it's an f-type SVR or a project 7
edition so you see that like a scoop
thing on the back that's what's on it
and it's got a wig dot on the side as
well not keen on the dark but oh my god
it's delicious
supplied and fitted induction hose to
replace EML and limp mode even to school
what that means but I've had it replaced
hopefully should be working and there we
go defenders Buck moment I get my keys
back from my defender this is going on
it I've refused to put it on it until I
get my defender back finally absolute
legend for himself up occur over here I
got her back my baby is back all right
I've got a bike let's get a drive and
let's go get some salt and pepper
chicken she's looking good I'm just
making sure there's no like dents or
scratches that are unnecessarily been
added onto it but she's looking good
she's looking good oh god it's so nice
to be out on my little go-kart and into
something beefier
let's go defender service but I thought
they would have cleaned the glitter off
my seat and most amazing thing ever my
bag of whatsits
it's still here I know they're not
supposed to throw anything away that's
yours bought a bag of wallets it's been
there for two weeks they'd only just set
off and one nearly died panel as
it drove away fell down on me and
blocked my leg from being able to switch
between
my coach to my break so like no joke
look I couldn't move my leg from my
clutch it's my break when it fell down
on me I was trying to put it open he
wouldn't sure I've looked at my light
and there's water dripping out of my
light which has never done that before
so I turn back round to Land Rover and
I'm hopefully gonna try and show him
this immediately so okay Sean
well drips aside she drives like a beast
she drives great the the noise isn't
there and you want it's gone they fixed
yeah I'm super happy with it I am good
about that drip and I don't know at the
time it might not have seemed it well I
was proper make it scary when that panel
fell on my leg so I was pressed down my
coach the panel felt it wouldn't let me
I couldn't I couldn't disc it they'd
like disengage in my clutch to move my
for so my foot was to talk down so I
couldn't accelerate to move out the way
for anything and I genuinely thought was
no questions are carrying front of me it
full-on pinned my legs they apologized
for and you know that's all they could
really do right happens I guess but
I'm scary man anyway next stop fish and
chip Chinese takeaway Spring Garden also
known as oh my god parking and a half
right there and keeps it your star your
absolute star thank you so much and help
that salt and pepper chicken was so good
by the way you can tell how awkward it
gets me vlogging around the family not
that they don't get it they've seen you
vlogging in they're cool with it but
it's just like there's a room full of
people and was that like no no they're
having their own conversation but I want
to vlog a moment it's just that all
could it be my brother brother all I
kind of go by and look at me like what
do you do it but this is the luxury of
coming to Lydia's aunt is whole I get to
help myself to any drink on one and you
better know leave a comment right now
done Lana burdock or fizzy them till you
know wall I know I walk down the line in
burdock I'm gonna do it doing it
today's the day fizzy don't imagine that
owning my own Chinese rest I want to
want my own spa
I want people I what a spa a paintball
arena go care arena and a Chinese
restaurant
I'll take away that's all it's exploding
is that just bottled water the bed
looks like a new irad let's get Rocking
let's go is now officially on the
keychain II if it wasn't more obvious
who's the Land Rover Defender coulda
said Land Rover I've now got a defender
on it but I'm gonna have to spray-paint
his black I'll customize it myself or
something because that is not my
defender
look out halfway I'm like seriously
that's how much joy this defender brings
me like driving this vehicle is it it's
like carrying the British flag I know
it's weird but it's like carrying pride
on your shoulders and I am so proud to
drive that thing like it it's a
beast and the more and more driving I
love this one don't gamer I love this I
love it
but dude I love that defender the more
and more I'm thinking about that you
know that 70 find a bursary when they're
released if you don't know what I'm
talking about I'll show you in a second
this right here is the 400 brake
horsepower v8 7 yes edition which I
believe is a hundred and fifty thousand
pounds but they're only making a hundred
and fifty of them so it's a very rare
selection I think you have to like send
them a lot being like hey I'd like to
buy one and then they have to like look
into who you are if they approve and
then if you pass like kind of the test
then they'll let you do it but as far as
I'm aware for transcripts through its
like the interior
I think it's automatic yeah look it's an
art mic it's got white a bit not
complete but bit of a modern - added to
it a lot of plastic you stuff like the
old defenders same old like small
steering wheel and Mike's like standard
like old-school - rather than on digital
imagine only one of these because I
truly think it could on this vehicle
could only do one thing and that is go
up in value now as a side tangent you
might be like wait a minute Tommy we
just saw you outside in daytime getting
out your cat yeah came in the house sat
down with Lydia fell asleep is now 10 11
p.m. at night and I decided to continue
this clip 5 hours after Lydia also fell
asleep but woke Oh awesome ah
we don't take spice did you put that
chair there to look up there in case
he's in damning ramen oh she woke up at
like 10 o'clock and she was like I want
to go to Tesco to see if like the
re-enter Lisle that's probably not what
it's called
if the aisle has any damn ramen in it
whose like what you're taking away I've
just woke up to the point where I
thought Tyler couldn't even clench like
a fist oh ya know so I said no so she
went with a mom she went all the way to
Tesco she was gone for ages I was like
she must have got me she must be even at
Mom's that was something she came back
and she didn't get on them when did you
resort to well first of all what is it
called what is it what is it we should
throw a blackout that's nice is this
when you bought it but this is the first
one this is the first one it's coca
chicken okay if I really like it the
survey says
it's no good well at first it tastes
bland but then he tastes chickeny and
then they taste like straw after ask
what are you doing why you just sat
there you are sometimes I swear to god
you are a human reincarnated because
most the time the stuff you do just
doesn't make sense
this is always this is how is a this how
it is hmm I'm gonna stuff you and to all
your playback do you want to do it
yeah I did suggest it play runescape
because she's playing runescape
it's got four yeah but it's only got a
six point four and imbd I only watch I
only watched films at seven okay okay
listen I was very entertained I've heard
all the music before because my mom used
to listen to it when I was younger and
stuff like that
unskilled does is to everybody disco you
ever go to I'm gonna give it
entertainment value and over at a music
I'm gonna give it a 9 out of 10 I know
they're all some sort of a fun like the
way the story came to give up what the
story was really good so no no it's in
blood
it's a good one to watch with your
girlfriend that's all I'm saying yeah I
was like loading runescape I was like
move to the side Lydia's Embarq is it
this is Lilly's character oh wait no no
no you didn't but you're running after
him you found him you found you found me
funny is an MP can teleport yeah are you
asking what's going on nice so you
killed him let's see what it drops
he dropped a red bead now the professor
from that point onward we played
runescape for about an hour
Lydia got herself to a whopping 15
woodcutting
17 fire-making she made herself a first
ever set of bronze arrows she mind the
oars she smelled in them
she then Smith them into arrowheads and
flight if the arrows of salvation she
she's like a professional runescape
player now but she was playing at his
chaps I said she can see why the game is
so addictive because what she wants to
do is just keep killing enemies and then
get to a higher level so she can kill
him quicker so she's getting there she's
got that like mindset of a gamer once
keep playing and playing a play and
that's where the addiction of video
games come so I always want to reach
that next goal and when you hit it then
you're like oh god now what it's a very
weird thing to compare it with life but
nonetheless we're transitioning Lydia
from getting to learn basic gaming on
runescape that I'm one thinking is
putting her on to a bit of Minecraft in
my block whoa what happens for now now
for now you know it's a lot of aiming
it's a lot you know picking your axe at
certain direction and I think that if
you play Minecraft together like on a
server I like our Xbox together
something
it'll be a really good way to give her a
sense of again sense a direction
sense of wherever she looks she'll here
be able to fight like combat with other
people and stuff like that bow and arrow
so she can like get used to like range
and drop off and stuff and eventually
we'll get Liddy to be the most talented
gamer out there may take me like six
years but we'll still try and achieve it
but nonetheless guys I have to go now so
yeah the grind continued I was dead
proud last night honestly she was
getting really tired but she really
really got into playing runescape last
night and it was really fun to watch
because she was like oh
killing things and killing things and
kill things and I was like the addiction
begins my go this is me currently
editing today's vlog this is the program
