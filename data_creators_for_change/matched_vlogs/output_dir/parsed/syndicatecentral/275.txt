Jaguar let's stop for and they got back
to me awesome South African dude was
like hello mister mr. castle I was like
so nice to me it was like yeah you're a
warranty from the company you bought it
from does not cover hoses and seals on
your engine so I have to pay for the
parts the labor and the hoses the seals
and everything and the diagnostic specs
so it's gonna get back in touch with me
with how much it's gonna cost so good
that it's not included in the warranty
but I said to him is that a common thing
for it not to be included and he said
London rover themselves do not extend a
warranty on hoses and seals and some
come back just engine parts of that kind
of shit so unfortunately I have to pay
for it all in about 45 minutes
