touch with the key people that I bought
it off because it got a six month
warranty on this car so hopefully within
that six month warranty it's gonna cover

something if you're not telling me what
it is mine well I definitely I go
there's a film called the beach it's in
Thailand and it's like a certain set of
islands in Thailand and I want to go to
that Beach I know I don't but it's a big
tourist destination I used to be like
your dad tropical nice Island
now it's overrun by tourists I want to
go to that Beach just to go to it say
I've been I don't want to sit there on
that beach and listen to moby pourcel in
the song No
won't disturb me on my own just relax
sorry what please put weight on no beat
it's snow fun when it's like this you
get it snowing it's actually snowing now
so I need that defender back and fixed a
sh god damn P and it is miserable also
this is a bit random but in the past
I've had people like this is aged like a
year ago now when I talked about doing
this extension a bunch of you will like
architects are you family were
architects something and sent in designs
of the extension I'm getting done and
that extension by the way is to take
that garage rather than it being there
is to be facing here obviously I never
spoke about this a lot there's a lot of
new people in now but that garage from
being there to sticking out here instead
so I can drive a car straight in and
then extending the house from up here
across it as well so like the house
becomes like an l-shape now people send
in the designs like on Twitter and stuff
like that but like I can't find the
design to send in I've got it saved on
my personal Facebook because the design
look awesome but if you were one of the
people who designed the extension if you
actually worked for the architect firm
I'd love to get in touch with you
because one you did an amazing job you
look great you could perfectly find out
my house and - I want to get I want to
get working with the new architect on
designing this and getting it done so if
you can reach out to me like you've
written original email or something like
that with your design so I can tell you
is actually you and you've done it
that'd be great a bit random but I
really want to get the ball rolling with
this house so I see what I'm getting
done and it is going to get gold and
when it gets gold
that means I would be able to drive this
car so I need my defender back oh 1.5
degrees
Oh God and it's coming down this is not
good I know it seems ridiculous but
they're in I know they are it's my
business
yeah delivery guy open the door like

my god do you know what that was for
yeah machinima gave me that what I

looks a bit suspicious he started peeing
and then as soon as you showed him say
no you brought up and squirt be
everywhere what was today's message what
is it I want one for the view
yeah keep forgetting them not fortune
cookies I thought it was gonna be
similar to do with like good things are
coming your way or some other I realized
it's not fathering cookies anyway right
just got a phone call off guy salmon
Jaguar Land Rover and they've told me
that the defender is still in there
they've not had time to check it out
what are you doing yeah you know you
know you know you're in trouble
you're absolutely in trouble anyway as I
was saying I've heard from Land Rover
Jaguar and he said that the the year the
defender hasn't or pretty hasn't been
able to be seen today so that sucked
however they're gonna try and get a
diagnostic by the end of the day which
by looking at the time is gonna be
pushing it because you've only probably
got hour left and they said they've not
had a chance to look at it once so
they're gonna give it a diagnostic check
over so I can't complain you're gonna
take a look at it once you take a look
at it they're gonna let me know and then
we're gonna we're gonna find out how
long the Jaguar is either gonna be one
off the road to gonna be taped to get
fixed and through it or three how much
it's gonna cost to fix it so as it
stands repair only defender oniy oh so
I've decided I'm a genius
every time I move a little a Gadsby
always pisses on the lips right okay and
I'm like oh no no no so now I've got to
let's raise so I felt this one and
whilst I go and clean that one so if
he's gonna piss and poo anyway you're
gonna piss a poop in the next circuit
rate rather than on for yeah another
bloody day where the lads are I didn't I
swear see I I was tempted to go on a
ride again on my own but he says it's
gonna be like minus one degree right now
and I'm like no I've liked that shit oh
well we should ride in every condition
you know big through bikers even though
I ride an electric bike
however no one's riding and they've left
me all by myself again because they're
already at the program behind so
ripped my trainers here by the way these
are not the new trainers are just bought

theodred that's answered you spin it and
watching some oh and like would you know
stop doing this it's only hail stoning
but it's cold and it's gonna freeze no
no no yeah but that's actually not even
funny sorry I am vlogging it right so
this is this Danny by the way uncool go
fuck yourself you call anaphylactic
shock right so if he eats notes you can
go into anaphylactic shock where you're
gonna need an EpiPen if he eats knocks
we did just realise I mean in noticing
you handed me the EpiPen so you have to
wipe this down of it but this is what
I'm supposed to carry around yeah this
shape this size that's not right there
now pass on that joke but this is what
I'm supposed to carry around with me
every single day and I haven't done for
13 years because if I ever get stung by
a wasp
I've got jab this in your leg do you put
in your leg
yeah stop it on your leg along along the
sea on the Saudi leg and this is this
makes your heart beat faster so it
becomes oxygen faster because your
windpipe is closed up so you can't
breathe and that keeps you alive for the
extra amount of time before you can get
to a hospital and they put a tube down
your throat I should carry this but it's
now got no allergies on it so Andy I'm
gonna clean it my name's Andy so I'm
gonna take a note for the vlog you know
you you you clearly gave me the EpiPen
for the vlog but you are drier yeah that
