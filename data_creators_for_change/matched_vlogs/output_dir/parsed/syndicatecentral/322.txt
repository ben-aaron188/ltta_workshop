then what my so steaming or look at
that's a bit better today I could be
wearing a pair of jeans if I want to but
that's not manly enough you know what is
manly wearing a kilt I think I'm gonna
wear a kilt today
yes stumped in there but I knew D and
I'm currently in a supermarket yet Luke
is a birthday gift for today I've
decided on Jagermeister
I don't even think he drinks it but he
knows I like kg bombs so I'm buying him
Jaeger for his birthday in memory of me
it makes total sense alright so I
managed to get Luke a really cute
birthday card it's like a little Hello
Kitty card to put then that's the bag
the brown bag that the earth jagerbomb
get that a bot came in so I turned it
inside out so there's no branding and
folded it to look like a nice little
package
I think it'll pretty good job to be on
this sale not a bad last-minute gift
you're welcome to move you're welcome
I've always seen these because I always
get lattes and stuff but I've never
tried a Frappuccino I don't think in my
life the other day I think it's just
coffee so it's right
well that tastes delicious
it's crazy that there's just so many
sidewalks that just look like this if
you've got nowhere else to go it's like
where did he go if they've built
themselves up a little house lie on the
sand the street then all to him boy
yeah then if they're if the police say
move on where they gonna go then they

I'm old skin yeah this place has got a
Breitling oh I really want to say I know
where I am but I just I just really
don't know I'm trying to picture this
from I've been to the mall and supposed
to go to several times before but this
is just not looking like it in the
slightest
out of this
but it what's going on here I'm so
confused
everyone
I have no idea where he is
I don't know what's going on but I'm
that was about to be awkward as tits I
just asked him what he was like cleaning
the trash who works for like them all I
was like you go you guys have a cinemas
here right because I just do not
recognize the layout of this building at
all and she said no it's closed I don't
go in there but I just spoke to Jordan
and he was like no this is the right
place okay so I'm just gonna try we
should try finding he's apparently is
here apparently is open and just that's
the woman stood right there I asked the
woman stood there is the movie theater
still and she said no it's closed down
it's gone right there literally opened
there's people going inside of it she
worked for that she worked for the place
that organizes everything here and she's
closed that's right there and it's open
look at this one
they've got super dry here you have the
bright but I wait for the record all of
this here never used to be here so I
feel like a lost child right now but
nonetheless somewhere I need to go
that's fine Jordan right so here's
Jordan found him did it get lost in the
middle of mood I heard that rave though
that was crazy are you sick do that I'll
show you a snap trying a video of it it
was dope they're fake snow and
everything but I just bought Twizzlers
two bottles of water and a chocolate
milkshake hey I bought the tickets at
least
how much for the tickets I just paid
more money in drinks and food than one
thing
American you okay shit together let's
fucking joke have you seen what they've
got on there showing the Titanic in 3d
you know I'm good I'll take a pass no no
this might be the first-ever time I've
sat at the front of this movie better
dude look at the size of American movie
cinema screens when you're like the
compared scenes at the end which I was
hoping to do which is like the
recreations a little pile on this map
it's got a place of where to get your
enemies fuck that where you be pick up
points so I have to do is go that way
and take a right and I can get my
football yeah I've had two never seen
one of these but it's one of those Tesla
like supercharged stations look how
thick those is so dope free power I
fucking love it this right you may have
seen before vlogs if you new around it
Let Me Entertain You so the height of my
apartment is perfectly the highest you
don't cars going past over there I don't
even notice any cars but caliber passed
over there is the highways so my
apartment port is the exact same level
as that now you look at my apartment for
like decking you go there's a nice bit
dirty all these bits away but what you
notice where it's dark
yeah that's literally car pollution go
ahead and show you like if I go like
this and wipe it that is all car exhaust
pollution pretty damn nasty so
especially that oh my god horrible let
me show you I can do this without making
too much of a mess you ready in three
two one
ooh that is it's just think like if this
is what's London naturally on the table
in Los Angeles all right from the
airport
this is literally the particles cannot
London over here think about that is
they give the fact that you're breathing
this in to get educated on what's going
in your systems you wonder where those
people in China walk around with masks
on yeah so not yet second stuff like
that but it's to help with pollution
apparently I think I may have just made
that facto brand new day 6 a.m. 6 a.m.
