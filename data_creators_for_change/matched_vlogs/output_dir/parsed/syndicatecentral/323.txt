so well as well was just incredible I'm
so proud of a twitch chat I'm so proud
of this community yeah you know what
it's now time to go home they've got
like two hours before the next set of

nothing before they start I'm gonna go
home by the time I get home I can watch
on a computer and see the full
production value of it so let's rock
aim well so man he snacks oh my lord

some props to the translator that like
actually made the communication happen

waste of time they've got really good
