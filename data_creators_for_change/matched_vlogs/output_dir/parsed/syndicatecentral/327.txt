ah spring okay that is a that's a
nice-looking sunset mm-hmm
that's a sunset not a sunrise no it's
like t o'clock in the afternoon no
particularly sure I do this myself and
this is what I do to myself on to get
meal put 12 I then snooze it from 12 all
the way till now literally every eight
minutes I click the side of my iPhone
button SUSE SUSE SUSE SUSE SUSE SUSE all
the way till now and then I end up
getting it when I feel fresh but if I
would have just never set an alarm and
just walk up whenever I'd feel ten times
more fresh and will not have a disturbed
sleep however we have a package oh it's
a package and it's the Razr broadcast
studio ok don't actually know what this
is let's take a look I'm gonna need a
knife for the job all right
Ray's a certified engineer in California
let's do this
put the knife down I just really this is
why raises unboxings good from the
get-go by the way cuz look you don't
even need a knife you can just do this
but I think if there's an award for best
package company of items raised it wins
it hands down welcome razor wait a
minute what comes in a briefcase
okay what the heck is this true story no
idea what this is
okie dokie James now I don't want to
just send this to sponsored streamers
like me took a bunch people about the
edge responses even sponsored dr.
disrespecting out which is awesome let's
put these off the edges look there's
mother truck around and see what's
inside
I think it's gonna be camera microphone
I know camera microphone broadcast Julie
oh okay I thought that already
hi there this Jimmy community stands at
the forefront an old pal for them and
emotional or entertaining medium in the
world spread by incredible tunnels boom
continues to be bigger and better
whether it's empowering a youngster
would take the first step simply
elevating the broadcast experience to
streamers who in your hands now on the
raise a siren and the Cairo that what
there are only 200 of these special
edition kits in
Walden want to share with you yes the
brand new razor webcam and the
microphone which I accidentally leaked
mm yeah if you guys don't remember I
actually got a package and unboxed it
and wasn't supposed to unbox it yeah
well if you guys don't know right so
this is obviously a microphone but is a
microphone but yeah people know
microphones but good story good story
razor but this it's pretty ingenious
like if you don't understand what this
is right now right you can mount your
webcam on the top of your on top of your
screen or wherever you put in right but
most the time you have these huge box
lights like this big like twice the size
of that chair right so it's massive and
you have to flick it on dead right in
your face because all you want is the
camera lighting to be natural on your
face however this is a lie a really
light built into the webcam so you can
just turn it on different stages of
brightness and you don't need the box
thing because the big box this
mothertrucker is now replaced by this
and this produces so much heat like a
lot of light like look like bang a lot
of it but it's just so intensely big and
you face that now this can be replaced
by this something much much smaller you
can travel around with this you don't
look this thing with you and you're
ready to rock along so again the reason
why I work with razor because they're at
the goddamn forefront of all the epics
like not entirely sure what's going on
here that's supposed to be care to
explain
oh yeah yeah yeah sick son why not
hundred percent this this is all stock
that we're using but then we've got 20
boxes but there's one problem I've
noticed with that boy on coffee duty and
that is who the hell does that this is
coffee sacrilege put a bits of coffee
inside the sugar I might as downloaded
but what I need to set up now is my
razor I think is the best headphones
ever from razor I used to like the DJed
arrows
in Stockton then it appeared arrows but
it won't wireless but these are worth
the weight in gold book that's bad boy
oh my lord is the other fun
it's beautiful I took the xbox version
which I use from a Playstation because I
think you can just use it either one the
evil one but Milo d-man Oda Maloney it's
nasty do you think that's everything but
when you lift it up at the back you've
got this box hid around there and it's a
bloody headsets down mate look at that
beautiful man
not good but not bad came second and
that's probably like my tenth ever game
on that game and you know what I got
like five kills pretty impressed
possible with sniper kills across the
map quite sweet I got a second place was
