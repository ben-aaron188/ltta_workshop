page supposed to be a one-word okay
anyway this is a boss interview with an
employee you'll come next all right
Alice Alice if you could hire you ready
you we have to hire new employees
theoretically I'll just hire a new
employee anyway anyone we know we have
to hire them who would you hire known
into not just topic
no not you guys that will you know
anyone a month I'm gonna show you the
same question even though your head is
hidden by this L'Oreal sponsored product
not sponsored it's actually not
sponsored but mom what who would you
have as an employee if you could have
that any anyone today about The
Apprentice about this is great but don't
take one for answering questions with
Anik leave a comment down below with a
deck but the record I'm not gonna watch
these clips but I'm gonna put the camera
in here and a chair in here and this is
gonna be like what's it called candy no
what's it called like truce in the
workplace where they go I hate my job
documentary so enjoy Alice's statement
and we'll go out the room and not be
able to hear it you get it give yourself
about 30 seconds hi great employee
you bring Starbucks all the time brings
me five guys it's dead God I mean it's
really cold in here there's no heating
it's not great but he doesn't pay me
enough and he works me too hard that's
the truth next employee is gonna be
Karen Karen can you please step forward
to the chair
please please come and sit down we want
you to give your opinion on me as a boss
I don't want to hear what you have I
want you to press this red button and
then you have 30 seconds
Thomas a boss is great because you know
the checks to make sure we're in work on
time in fact I don't think he even knows
if we come to work five days a week
hey ho my only concerns are the tea
should have more involvement in the
business make decisions more quickly and
come up with some ideas of his own the
air brained ideas he does come up with a
usually completely rubbish thank you
that was my turn how old my name is Tom
I'm the boss of syndicate original and
I'd like to say that word oh
they must jump lien and make t1d toast
sent me a Predator pop vinyl and a
captain jump rice however I do actually
have both of these already Jem is in
Gemma by the way sorry hello Tom Lydia
g'loona regards me Alice Karl mommy
syndicate and Ken and everyone else we
have forgot peas turn over okay I did
read it off however I do have food on my
face I do actually have them pop figures
so today what I'm gonna be setting up is
an eBay page to be able to auction off
to charity the pop figures that I've
already got duplicates offer and then
all the morning operates on that is
gonna be Menominee in partly to motor
neuron disease and cancer research
because there's some there's some things
that I've got set aside to auction off
for the money that we're gonna raise for
Alec because what we're trying by with
that is a gaming like thing to push
around in the hospital ward that Alec
was actually based in so I mean we said
that page up soon
soon as I set it up I'll probably option
off one pop vinyl a day and will every
pop vinyl we've got we're gonna have a
syndicate poster that I'm gonna hand
sign and write maybe write a little note
on it or something to your face so and
then you'll be able to bid on it on eBay
so whether we make a penny a pound ten
pound one hundred pounds on one then
that'd be pretty cool so I'll probably
give away one of my actual pop figures
that I've already got that I haven't got
multiples of but it'll be like a rare
one so it'll be worse it'd be worth more
I suppose well yes that's what I'm gonna
be doing with duplicates so thank you
