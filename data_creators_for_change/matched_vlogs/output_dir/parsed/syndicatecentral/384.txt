midnight so can we all go come on come

me come on
especially you Missy get out I have to
question my parenting skills right now
of these cats not only want that I'm
very proud that the walk on the glass
floor and don't care about any more but
the fact that I'm letting them play
particularly cats bit with this
soundproofing and this is just a spare
little piece book I'm actually allowing
them to rip this to pieces which is not
good because that's just going to
encourage them to next time walk in here
and go oh I know soundproofing on the
floor holy mother of god there's an
entire wall of it so yeah should
probably confiscate that off you make
you know this is kind of weird that you
guys are just shush what to you
you guys just know you don't for that do
not like them good job are you trying to
get are you just a because you're a
badass like your mother is as a like
that when these cats act so sassy and we
don't want to play with you any of that

of the night both of them I just lay in
bed with me I think fast asleep they're
so good thank you
