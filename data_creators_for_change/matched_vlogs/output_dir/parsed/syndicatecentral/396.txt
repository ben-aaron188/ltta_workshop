really okay I'm give it a 9.5 just
because like the bit with the plot twist
bit right we start coming back as a bit
like that wasn't necessary but it was
really really good if you want to go and
see it Kingsman movie it was he caught
the ball and so it was out no i don't i
only know Blade Runner liberated 2014 I
was over there no but Kingsman oh my god
I wish he would have paid me to promote
the Kingsmen dick really recommend it
was it better than the first one
nobody was as good as might you know
sequels and all the poop it wasn't as
really good and the storyline was pretty
solid to be fair I did like it so I'm
doing 9.5 action scenes or the first
taxi bit was

walkable filming this I'm joined here by

gentleman I walked lady at to a car now
she's probably gonna run me over looks
like a beat you stalking me I go missing
her name's Lydia go find her
none my wife no no okay Houston we may
have a problem and the problem is I
usually keep the doors locked and why so
tissue just randomly okay that makes no
sense
hey we usually keep the cats locked in
this vicinity so you know they count
like going around the house and we lose
them sort of thing
well this door was like to open there's
no cats in here and now the cats have
the ability to go up there or down there
now I'm pretty sure that door was closed
and the cinema that was closed so that
means there's some kitty cats on the
loose
I think upstairs all right mr. Gadsby
this is your test
now can you walk around the glass but
how do you stood on the glass and plop
hey they always walk to the edge board
was walking on it it doesn't care what
oh hell yeah go on Gatsby is like that
wasn't difficult at all we kill drug
what were even testing to find out and
I'm hoping that the last time these cats
went into my office they didn't rip to
pieces
my insulation well not my insulation my
soundproofing because if you didn't know
it didn't see the video they climbed up
it see there and started scratching it
so I don't have to do it to this okay
come on really that easy
don't worry I'll turn off the lights
sorry to disturb you
well as long as you haven't taken any
poos in here and you just probably
chilling out you're more than welcome to
stay

done this test before but next up on the
test list
