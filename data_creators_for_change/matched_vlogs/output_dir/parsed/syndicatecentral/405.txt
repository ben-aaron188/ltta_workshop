new dawn new day and let me show you
something right now Lydia already has a
cap Jax has three or five I think
they belong to with you that one looks
like it's falling apart and then where's
this one Hey
how how you doing good all right that
one I was treating you well I hope you
mad what are you doing I got you out to
playing you're staring at yourself in
the mirror I wonder if he can see
himself and he thinks it's a friend do
you need do you need a bearded dragon
friend is that what you need Steve is
that what you need Oh finally ready to
start this day yeah yet again sadly in
England it's raining oh my god they're
actually starting work on the house next
door again yeah if you've not followed
anything to the story of that house
here's a story town my accountant moved
across the road I was like yeah she's
awesome she moved across she built this
like really nice modern house I bought
apparently some along the lines of it's
a flat roof and he leaked into the house
and that ruined all the house and they
were like hey builders that's your fault
or someone and then the builders were
like peace yeah I don't get me wrong I
don't accept him he ran off with him he
just kind of like was like well we can't
fix it well but anyway they sold the
house someone else moved into it they
were like we could fix a roof
nearly moved in roof broke again so I
think they need a new roof is no
neighbors cuz my friends over there
moved out my homies over there can't
live in it because the wrists leakin and
then the wall of the road that one's
still being built
Oh God is the 92 year old in that story
thinks I'm the boyfriend I mean I am a
boyfriend so you know just kind of wing
that one Steven I could hear you scratch
oh he scratched his way into his little
cave mat he's got food needs a bit more
wine he's a okay next destination is to
go down to Lydia's get the cats and
bring them home I'm not not sure if I
gave you guys like another update of
what's happening with Olivia basically
you know I said she was ill and they
think it might be like some of her over
or maybe kidney stones well we saw
another doctor when she got some scans
and stuff and the doctors waiting for
the results from the scans but he said
he's a hundred percent confident but
can't be sure I would have said night
and I'm saying
and then but he said 100 that it is
indeed kidney stones so really sucks
but it can be treated and it can be good
well not be good but you know it it can
be taken care of so yeah she's she's
hanging in there oh no the door was left
open cats please still be in there okay
I see one cat where's the other where
you doing what you doing come on it's
home time because I don't want to go I
think they are just like polygons each
other lit a tray and Bowl confirmed cats
you ready to go yep again that poo stain
is beautiful you did a good job that
team right we're good
no you're s'posed parent it's okay this
is just the real world when you get your
jobs and we let you outside you'll be
able to check it all out so until then
it's time to go you okay
don't worry it's okay spook - where's
the zip where's the zip okay I don't
right now I can't exactly let you out
I'm sorry
Shh okay it's okay I can't let you out
out because the two of you and I'm
driving so I'll just quickly say yeah I
love you real quick there's a tickle
there's another tickle I know I don't
know staying about stay in the baggie
okay let's go up to the house
immediately why are you all looking at
me like that
stop looking at me like that we're hot
we're literally home literally I'm
taking you inside whatever you do don't
all put your weight on that side because
if you do it will most likely fall over
okay okay just did a quick check of the
house we're good to release and are you
all ready are you steady release the
cats nope like we're home scratching
post yeah happy to be home she spooked
she's spooked from the car drive
I tried driving smoother that's all I
can say all right successful mission
cuts like blinding light okay I'm now
going to syndicate module I will catch
you kids later
we're Germans a bit of capital and we're
going to Starbucks for Ally so engine
off nope that's engine on engine off
okay that works
I'm gonna be a genius people say another
reason why we've got bad weather in
England is maybe to do with the
Hurricanes in America probably not
probably made a massive idiot of myself
easy mode he's looking all nice and all
that but tomorrow I'm test driving
something so it makes sense I'm like wow
syndicate original looking crisp and
clean like it should be perfect
oh yeah big Alex went off to Ibiza and
my mom stayed there cleaned it all up
and made it look perfect so we know the
culprits do we do we know where it is
yeah we do
okay we're gonna need to know the spot
on my children just had it like that but
there's a reason I'm here it's
indicative regional because by popular
demand by crazy popular demand the hype
has been built up for the return it
stuck in the air real quick of this sell
for these and we're gonna do one one
last chance to get your hands on a
syndicate original stealthily if you've
never seen it before it's like a comma 5
to print another stealth design and it
