won't see some fun out of my terrorist
cats so my plan of action today is go
get Lydia some soup even though I'm
rushing like crazy I'm probably be late

on Mount Kilimanjaro move your fat EOS

England today not exactly flip-flop
weather though it's shoes with no socks
fashion time
and oh my God look at that unlined well
luna got a load of part of which color
should we get where's this caps just
getting a tray so it's getting this tray
and that's that I'm hoping that's
everything I need for a cat now to
forget not to forget about my Mather boy
Steve needs food I got a spray then you
spray where the cat was previously peed
and it breaks down the smell of the
enzymes or whatever it is so when you
break down the smell the cats don't
think oh that's where I pee before
that's why I always pee so instead they
pee in a letter tray and always pee in a
letter tray also same time what's my
fucking cat no I've no idea my cache
