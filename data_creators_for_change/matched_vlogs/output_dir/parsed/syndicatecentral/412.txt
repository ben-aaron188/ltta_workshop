they're chilling rather than being hid
down the sofa you know either they're in
the open so I can keep my eyes on
themselves they're not just doing
nothing so if you're hungry and you want
some food I'd already just hide beyond

ever met look at you you just fat lazy
cats being a father of two it's
difficult also yes I am wearing my easy
alright stream we're ready well rocky we

fucking go mother of God the mossy one
Giga Giga go subscribe for 30 months row
oh my lord what DK less on subscribed
for 41 months sir I just said thanks for
subscribing for four months in a row
everyone just like 40
one month's what the hell mimmo dropping
the 37 months subscription yeah gatdam
still alive oh 17 left I've had two
kills and oh my gosh like 20 penguins
with a 42 month subscription
what yeah that is exactly how I feel so
I didn't quite explain like don't worry
it's not die serious but I didn't quite
explain what happened we Liddy yes that
she's not well but Lydia's got like a
kidney infection at the moment so she's
like in agony like beyond belief to the
point where last night where throughout
the entire day she felt like coming on a
bit worse if it wasn't a bit worse to
probably just absolutely centre like
someone she's stabbing with a knife or
no more than - with a knife so a point
where every 20 minutes which I get to
like trying to sleep
she was just in bad pain she took every
day like tablets she could Coco de Mer
which is are the strongest like
medicines you can get in the UK from I
think like over the camera however you
get it she took one of those and he just
didn't do anything to whatsoever so like
first thing in the morning a moment have
taken it to a hospital or a GP or
whatever and got like seven in BIOS
because they think it's just like a
white such kidney infection but it's
happened before and it's frequent so
hopefully she's gonna go to the doctors
on Wednesday they're gonna check his
scan and see fur I want to say kidney
stones if that's the case they have to
bike blast them somehow I don't know how
that works but we have to blast them but
it's just causing Lydia's so much pain
and he just fucking sucks cuz there's
nothing I can do there's nothing that
cats can do there's nothing her mum can
do all the kernels into what she doesn't
need anyone to couldn't look all over or
anything like that she just needs to
fight it out because she's in that much
pain boy I love her to pieces and I
would be by her side every minute of the
day if I could but it would just do
nothing for her so yeah they just
finally explained what's actually wrong
with Lydia cuz I know it was like she's
in real bad state she's in the real bad
state didn't quite say what it was so
that's what's wrong with Lydia and
