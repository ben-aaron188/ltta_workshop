like say it's from a glass or kissing
someone and someone I want to get called
so you can never get rid of it like
called saw it just lays dormant in your
system and just like flares up whenever
it feels like it I only know is to get
them after a night out where I've been
taking like shots of drinks because
like you take the shot and it's just
like a glass that may not have been
cleaned properly so the bacteria another
scientifica makes no sense but that's
