nice day on those bye bye oh yeah I
don't remember anything
Amazon I know from towel from for your
dad neoprene cable sleeves for TV home
computer management systems wait
I completely right this wrong wait what
gifts note from Thomas old Carroll for
your desk from Tom I'm why I said this
to myself okay this Thomas Oh Carol you
might be a goddamn legend I was going to
get up this morning and go to a like a
hardware store just so I could buy a
sleeving to put this in but I'm after
order one more of these no I'm not
asking you to tell me what I'm saying I
might need a few wallah it keeps them
all nice and tidy together it does look
like a bit of a show there but yeah
you get the you get the point but it's
pretty awesome I look luckily
semi-fitted laying around and you can
just cut this stuff up this is probably
not what you're supposed to do but
there's no way I can have this whole
thing like down it wouldn't make sense
but look at that it just makes it
already look so much neater and tinier
now I do Tom thank you so much for this
cable sleeving like no joke I was having
dreams last night of me installing like
a really crappy version of it and me
stressing out and it's just not working
and this is the best I've got to with it
probably a YouTube video or watching it
being like applied better because
certain cables you know we're really
short and tight so I can't exactly
move them over here to join up together
you know some of them down the bottom
have to go across rather than down so
I've tried my best with it and you know
what this is ten cans better than what
it was to start with so Tom thank you so
much dude I as well use it
on these even though it looks like a
snake it's better to have that there for
now I look probably flying it out to go
I was like we'll just stand in a little
bit it will probably just flatten out
over time but at least then all the time
looking without mixed up here like snake
or double snakes if I start putting too
much of it on it might just really patch
your way so they might just keep up that
for there and then try and work out how
can I apply this to the other cable and
to everything that's going on down here
wow it is so nice out today how this
sucks because like I just spent all day
yesterday starting out my gaming soap
and kind of never want to leave that
room ever again but I think we should
dish something outside today but what
from one legend today Thompson leave
that cable management stuff to this hole
Dimond thank you so much Liz if you guys
know every time I fire on another one
pointing but my sister over there from
London to Manchester who used to give
out these zip it for free and these are
my sister's favorite biscuit lemon melts
and that was the only way we used to
obtain them there was a shops or in
Manchester where you can go on Barden
but we never knew because it was just
always a free biscuit that you got on
the British show is right in there with
the best biscuit but poor devil absolute
legend who said you work from a British
Airways for the v8 group said I was
eight perfectly crispy this is why we
are the greatest family on YouTube you
guys are amazing thank you yeah let's do
this I don't know what's going on with
England but kind of nice
well my car got cut off that mom
the bed literally the hell these birds
in my treatise on laxatives or something
uh why did I bother picking it all up
because now I've got to read put it into
bags to be able to cash it in
George my life can see why people go to
those change machine one because the
front of selfies are probably changing
and just look and then it tells you how
much money you've got bought it takes I
think like maybe like 10 percent or
somewhere which is not acceptable you
should not be giving away money like
that to a machine that counts it when
you can count yourself and especially
when you already counted yourself put
your Nydia engine put into bugs so you
can take it into the bank Tom how on
earth is a radio station called cheesy

station it's time to be a good boss even

quiet
you evil childhood getaway you such as
savage put my gosh you down but Alice
so you know we're going sing Kong the
film starts a fuss for hmm nothing but
go what film do you want to watch
instead yeah what I was going to Logan
with any good but yeah the scene Logan I
gave it seven point nine not too good
for you you know me in films mom pretty
critical I think you would have felt the
set it was emotional but I think you
would have felt the same
lynnie world IMAX pull hold the door for
my mother because I'm a kind of son and
walks through this one instead we've
made in time I probably the period time
hell yes Oh God
p9 alright congra view ten outta ten
visual effects it was in critical
probably one of the best-looking films
as ever seen in my life
however the storyline kinda just at the
end it's good and there's a plot but it
just goes what do you think there was
action partners on the edge CPC but he
just died to just at the ending ending
like castaway here like the overall out
of ten I'd probably give it a seven
my not might have to be a seven point
five just because of the ending I was
expecting more like and there's a scene
with the woman in Kong that's a bit like
what the made of NASCAR oh yeah Samuel
Jackson that was a disappointing car
bought honestly Samuel Jackson great
actor all the actors are amazing and the
Contra comedic effect to the film was
really good as well like really enjoyed
that and I need to I don't know about my
car but yeah a visual sets ten out of
ten what I'm one of the best visual
films I've ever seen in my life
really down there don't you find your
car 101 press the lock button and OOP

being maybe fit is that the twenty three
years of your life actions to having me
like today I'm really sorry for
yesterday's vlog being like it should
published at the right time but it just
didn't it was 28 minutes late not
acceptable not on you guys saw me
staying up till 6 a.m. getting uploaded
so it was ready for the next day like I
was in the movies and I was like I'm
talking out the notification saying it
went live so I checked and agit Ella
done some so so sorry I like that some
of it he was actually one of you but I
vlog that you're going on I don't see
real ago that when I'm naked what used
to be Jonah it's kind of really good
good times putting it together mama if
you're watching this vlog I'd like to
apologize being on your toilet so long
to the point where you had to tech me in
your own house without asking me if I
was okay
oh god miss my grandma so much but not
too sure what's going on Morales she's
probably spilling food as usual but what
a nice photo
and there's me as a little kid with a
little penguin he's my little revived
mom mom hell is going on with my shoes
what what did you make me wear as a kid
that is awful also that lunch box came
filled with what with what it's a Capri
of silver lunch box when we bought it we
opened open it had like ten or twelve
Caprio Suns and that's why I picked it
but there's me looking like the little
boss Alice looks like a sausage but Oh
in the old house Alice when she
graduated University and then Alice
black hair my mom looking fancy I also
love the fact that you've got one two
three four pictures of Alice here and
one of me oh yeah okay scordia
know you know when I was in the cinemas
right I had a drink on my left and I had
a bag of sweets on the right and as you
saw I walked in the cinemas win and as I
was shut down I took my glasses off I
didn't want to put them fit every
without a pocket for it so I hooked them
on the arm of the chair the drinker a
hook them on it as we left I had to
sweet in the cup holder and the Oakley's
next oh and I was like should I take my
sweets now there's only like three left
I'll leave you for the cleaners to pick
up
if I was taking the bag I wouldn't
notice the old clothes but I didn't so
me trying to be healthy cost me Oakley's
but right now it is 9:48 p.m. and they
had films at 9 o'clock so that means
there still has to be people in the new
desk Illinois so we're going to get up
in the car and go and try and retrieve
the Oakley I have to succeed at this
mission because when I was in the Cayman
Islands I scratched my custom syndicate
Oakley's and now I've just lost one of
my favorite pairs of Oakleys
hi if you think I'm going to get my
Oakley back leave a comment right now I
am probably like hmm I'm sixty percent
sixty cent confident we are going to get
them back and I'm hoping they handed
them in rather than keeping them like
Katy nice that says always do the right
thing oh just do the right thing just do
the right thing someone's like I've been
here once tonight already okay if I
don't get these back I'm going to be
absolutely Jochen easily one of my
favorite pairs of oakley's do you think
I'm going to get them back because my
60% just dropped to fifty if they are
here I'll be absolutely shocked yeah
along here's what color anywhere they
were bright white my 50% has now gone to
10%
and dwindling good my 10 person goes to
1% I have one percent hope that the
staff who clean that room who when I
walk out me my mum saw them and they
like to recognize me for my doing
YouTube and stuff I hope guys if you're
watching this lad and you have to see
the sunglasses please tell me you handed
them in or you have them I'd really
appreciate it get in the back thank you
no I don't want worth losing a set of
Oakley or opening up a fridge to find it
absolutely nothing to eat except tuna
Mayo soup like no no I hope your
situation right now
thanks I'm true to my wife I'm very
hungry
but how can I eat knowing my Oakley's
are out there somewhere that's why I'm
on the floor I don't have a goddamn clue
I think I'd edit in my vlog or something
on the floor maybe like 30 minutes ago
and then just never got up I guess it's
one of them today you know you win some
you lose some
we had a win at the start of the day
because we got them cable sleeves but
then we lost at the end a night because
I lost my oh please happens I know

going to end it there for today guys

morning I never actually got around to
setting up the echo dot so tomorrow will
