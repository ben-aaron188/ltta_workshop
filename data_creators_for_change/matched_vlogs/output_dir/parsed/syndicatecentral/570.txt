and I know he made a little bit he I
would totally go on adventures of my
life I don't want to risk missing my
quiet ex I say next up London Heathrow
was the first benign Freud was delayed
till 10:30 p.m. gate pieces oh you about
to know this is going down right now
I've come to the other business lounge
to try and set up my my computer in here
and I'm like no idea it was going to be
a full-on desk so I'm going to I'm gonna
for one set up my portable gaming cells
and here for four hours I got four hours
to kill suspecting it says where was I
said limiting your time on this computer
to a maximum of 15 minutes I see how
about backing out I try and see how long
I can stay here playing hey to mt1 for
fucking gold we're gonna walk down there
I'm gonna have a microphone at my webcam
on absolutely everything if I can scream
from here am i so this is one empty path
looks like and if we go over here real
quick this is what myself looks like oh
he know I've got like my milk some I got
my headset I got my laptop I got like
Mike I've got this one foot for a second
but I've got this charge in I got my USB
extender got my GoPro charge of my
headphones charging my I'm gonna start
like charging these out over the space
before hours but this is the ultimate
traveling game himself
it's brilliant the one downside it most
likely going to be this but I'm not
streaming and might record but I just
wanted to set this all away I know it's
so random and point was what wait what
wait what they have
they have 20 of those be joking they
have 23.9 uploaded deaf six down pretty
terrible but 23.9 that's crazy if I
could see an Ethernet port I could
technically call you my laptop no my
blade when is that laptop does not I
repeat not have a at that poor but I
have a USB to Ethernet adapter the
dominant a cable h1z1 king of the kill
is currently under mayhem and no
institution this is painful
Oh apparently was going to be doing
scheduled maintenance set eight hours by
just are a pop up saying that and
seananners it was playing hey twenty
once all right fuck out play within sort
of thing and then when I try to load up
the game that happened no we have to
play with loose capers on which I've now
made a security system so when I walk
away and leave my laptop here no one can
steal anything you look like what I've
got it to my webcam setup recorded and
I'm going to minimize it so if anyone
comes in in fucks with anything I'll
catch monkey I'm not trying to capture
one doing anything because I don't think
anyone more than I'm pretty sure the
cameras in a but just for like when I go
and get a drink or go to the toilet and
then no one going to walk off unless
they walk onto the laptop and they walk
up with a security system anything that
once wrote this is my security sir it
took me a whole three minutes you will
take a poop as you can see I left at
this point here bye-bye I then
contingent tintin tintin nobody came by
absolutely no one absolutely nothing
absolutely nothing and that boom this
guy what a great idea
is it again if someone walked off with a
laptop that we just described or in
concept it worked
this line sock is that a nice little
buffet some snacks and drinks and a
fully stocked bar not bad right not bad
I like you
and the selection of fruit I shall be
back I'm listening to Beyonce by other
way and a beer and a bit of old school
runescape she's all this gaming soap for
obstacle runescape
I bought my own mind yes this is what
I'm talking about h1z1 is working up and
running I got my setup going I got some
awesome news that this is the razor lap
supply the latest on it got but I got
news that I'm getting something new
quite soon so we may be doing a giveaway
of one of those razor laptop so you'll
just have to stage you know be talk
about it for a long time like an
ultimate giveaway of like a mobile self
- the bids but I'm playing h1z1 I've
already got two kills thank you this was
a very successful lay over five hours in
Miami unfortunately not a full five I
was in hey 21 thought I'm back playing
it but drinks we're kicking back I'm
hoping to fall asleep on a plane and we
good boys we do it is definitely fun
getting the command center up and
running on a bike on the move because
this is like the ultimate like mobile
game gaming vlogging cells and it works
absolutely perfectly the only thing
alone is the fact that h1z1 was down by
the servers with armboard nonetheless
we've got working for life our are
playing a couple of skills absolutely
was really getting to somebody to watch
my volume of tri like if I can so it's
been an air for you might all think so
I give you respect positioning
nonetheless it's been a great five-hour
layover I would have liked to have gone
round Miami for the day but you know
what this kind just worked out even
better so

while I just kick back on a rocking
chair but I am in a rocking chair and I
just went into that one to complain
