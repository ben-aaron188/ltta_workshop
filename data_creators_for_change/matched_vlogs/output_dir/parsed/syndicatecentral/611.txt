but my buddies R in the vlog so I'm
sorry guys I've been able to do
absolutely nothing regarding keeping
fluids in my system I haven't eaten
anything
I can't drink anything it just comes
back up in like 10 minutes
I just want to sleep I just want to eat
I just want to drink so this is what my
nights consisted of fucking tissues blow
my nose with wall this stuff that's
supposed to like make you really really
better and just put like like good
nutrients back in your system can't
drink me to gate or HSA right back up
and then kind of the dried ginger ale
that like is the only liquid up enough
to drink and keep down
all right guys well I'm really sorry
about today's vlog I just did not expect
after all the grind of getting here you
know the Cabret like almost breaking
down having to fix the chains on
everything like that I did not think
when I got it I was going to end up with
food poison or something like we have no
idea what it's from because we've all
been pretty much eating the same food
like I want to say I feel better now but
like this is I drink something it just
comes straight back up I cannot keep
anything in my system I'm just like
really really disappointed cuz like you
saw how hyped I was like coming out it
was like a 20 minute vlog of like me
being like stoked
AJ's like amazing at doing like trips
and a snowboard and stuff I was like
hoping to like film them and like not
just try and rush down the mountain like
actually try and film but really sick
like snowboarding video but I guess life
just happens and you know I say life's
too short make the most of it that's why
I just stayed on the snowboard rather
than being like a conduit like a state
snowboarding but got so far when I was
like I liked like week like I was like
mumbling my words I'm so light-headed
and dizzy
oh my god this is ridiculous so I just
have to get back and come and just try
and get some fluids inside me so
