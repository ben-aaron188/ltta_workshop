three o'clock in the morning of that
doo-doo-doo-doo Donna jump in a bathtub
and watch The Walking Dead boom boom
boom shut today was gonna be a no hot
hair day today but that way no hot head
a hair no hot day today bought to
celebrate the launch of the new heart
boom could infer ah decided that we're
gonna rock it so if you want to get when
the brand-new Civic original hearts
that's come out today actually no that
was yesterday then you can go and get
them loops to me down inscription
everyone's been asking when they're
coming out and the family out before
Christmas for there you go also I'm
wearing no pants this lighting is so
sick but we have a package today that
we're gonna be unboxing this has been
trying to get delivered to me for the
past three weeks I have no idea what's
in it so we'll have to wait oh my god
yes oh my god I was like a bottle flip
right on the ticket it says Julie so
don't know anything Jimmy that my
acceptance before it feels feel quite
heavy
okie dokie Jones okay on the on the note
it says okay to leave behind fence so
thank you God it isn't rain when the
stuff delivered but the package is
dududududu oh Germany I got my
brand new razor controller solid dude
come make it down to I 50 nine where
razor just unveiled their brand new
razor controller for PlayStation 4 that
allows you but yeah if semi want design
for East Wars oh take a look at the
controller whoa whoa whoa you get a note
with it saying congratulations there's
no turning back
winning is all about utilizing the tools
available to you that's pretty nice sign
by men the CEO of razor I'm watching you
boy oh whoa that's packaging I like this
wait wait wait wait wait where's where's
there's the stock but where's the
stickers well I like I just got this
brand new thing I might know stickers
where the stick daddy ah yeah let's take
care of business first of all today
Dennett dinner then
oh they're all peeling down dammit scoop
there we go
I raise this sticker add it onto the
wall by the way the reason why these
tickers keep fighting was this wall is
so cold and it's like an outside wall so
when you stick it to it the glue
adhesive can set to the wall from the
stickers so that those slowly all over
times go e so when dad's going to do is
going to put a piece of wood all the way
across so like even like to see like
that thing that sticks out that'll all
be hidden and you won't even notice it's
like a fake wall but then we're gonna
paint over and I'm gonna stick all my
stickers to that because then in the
future if I ever decide I want to take
it down I could do you like cut it down
in sections and then like hang up in my
houses like Outlook something like
people did I'm sick to be honest you
guys don't care about goddamn stickers
oh let's take a look inside this why's
my phone roomy around there we go
let's take a look are you ready never
seen this before actually off le or held
it whoo oh we got the we got their
chrome bones on the back all this snap
nice nice rubber grips on the back as
well and yeah it comes with a little
tool by honest review it feels really
really ergonomic like that there you see
how it's like you can see how it like
can I feels like it sticks out a bit
more that holds your fingers so really
well as you can tell at the moment I
grip the controller at the moment I grip
the controller may like fingers go right
into the buttons there so they're really
really really cool and everything seems
fine but you've got these extra ones as
well these that I will never I don't
know if I'll be used to playing with
them to that sticker off like I'm only
used to these two so having an
additional set of buttons like if you
play like scumpii like the claw then
you'll probably do that but I don't know
if I'll use them ones that much but
these I'll use these four days I like
that they're actually Chrome as well I
look really nice well see this though I
had this very parties I cannot be asked
waiting for the house to come and get
clean so when you've got to do it
yourself
you've got to do it yourself and you
know what it's kind of satisfying not
sure if you guys remember a while back I
thought someone like almost tried to
break into my car by like wiping the
water off my actual window and then like
you know peering into it but it turns
out it always happens on my car so it
looks like something like this like to
look into it it always does it there can
anybody explain the prize it's miserable
in England and raining there's men to
get healthy food from
go instead angel walk away with a
$1,000,000 scratchcard pound I'm British
