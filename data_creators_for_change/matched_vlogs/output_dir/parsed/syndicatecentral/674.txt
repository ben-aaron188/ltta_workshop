we're starting today off by saying good
morning to you by Steve because we have
some bad news today and I don't have to
do it I remember in the vlog Steve had a
cricket in here which has been his
friend he's loved it you know like we've
made fan out for it and stuff like that
but obviously that's a big poop
but basically through all the comments
and concerns in the latest vlog
apparently the cricket is in here Steve
to eat you no joke and I really wish I
was joking here because I want them to
be friends forever but basically
crickets try and hide inside of a very
muffled a lead dragon and then they eat
on the dead skin of a bit dragon now
it's kind of like some people are saying
this is a myth no it's not yes it is no
it's not and that if the if the cricket
bites too much of a bit drag in the same
place it can you know obviously cook the
Dragons actual skin skin and then it can
get infected because you don't see it
and then they can go by and all sorts of
different stuff so for safety and all
that best risk we're going to take
Geppetto out of Steve's for fair room
and break up the friendship so that day
Steve when we saw Geppetto sigh on top
of your head apparently it was eating
you so we don't have to feel so bad but
what about Susie I haven't seen them all
day but please tell me of you
have you eaten him let's hope you
haven't eaten because it's feeding time
you hungry hmm YUM you want Derrick one
dead good stuff you want Dada Dada
hopper bro you want get what Karen off a
bro you aren't dead you weren't dead you
like that he does not give two shits
this morning what's going on
go for it Stephen give in to temptation
eat the cricket Stephen always seen it
look at his eyes he's like I'm watching
today's the day we're going away we're
gonna get dressed cause we're going away
alright so part of action today is were
traveling and we're going to New York
City where the girls are clean and the
grass is broken at the work the girls
are cleared I don't even know where I
was going out but basically I'm going
over to New York today for a few days
and whilst them are there I'm gonna be
working so I'm not gonna be able to vlog
like at all like Tom that's just not
pile of deal this is daily vlogging
little shit get your shit together and I
agree but it's really gonna be that time
constraint that I'm not gonna be able to
vlog like at all so I'm going to try and
film little snippets throughout the day
and if I can it'll build some sort of a
vlog but what I'm gonna try and do is
fill the gap with like QA or something
so I really really need
you guys help as to what to do in flight
the next few days of how to fill content
for this channel because usually I just
fill my day but if I can't fill my day
then what does that say about my day
okay that this is really weird
setting off to go to the airport and
it's fucking snowing what's this about
me snow snow what the fuck
I just hope to look of God that someone
hasn't already crashed in this line just
the zero point zero one inch of snow
that's fallen all we can do is hope and
pray I definitely made the right
decision saying off Holly because if I
would have left any later I was gonna
sell for half seven they photo set up a
half seven I would never have made it
but like we said a little bit of snow
and everyone shot themselves or for
Terminal three
we meet again the weather is getting
awful it was snowing now it's raining
and also thunder and lightning like
crazy so I would not be surprised if my
flight gets either delayed or canceled
look at the size of the line that is
ridiculous
thank god I've got priority boarding so
I just went straight to the front and
now we go to the gate there we go
made it through security took quite a
while but now I'm through just feels
really weird to be watching the Sun
rising I'm used to it setting and then
it just being darkness so we're going to
the airport lounge to grab ourselves a
beverage and a bald head unfortunately
they only have iPhone 7 smart battery
cases you don't have movies yet so I'd
have to get something like that they
only have it for a seven not a seven
plus so I cry every time and also look
at this for if I have could for just a
leather case I don't need this shit in
my life okay so I actually caved in and
I bought a case and now I do buy the
four it could run this was like thirty
pound it's just like a silicon like hard
case because I've got the shiny iPhone
and it just gets scratched so bad so
it'll protect as much as possible so I
just picked up this phone out to give it
a better grip problem it just like
sliding so until morph we bring those
out mock reduce the size of shit
also but in the end you got some cereal
some fruit and yogurt and chemistry and
for breakfast we have chocolate
croissant jam glass haand and a poncho
this is honestly like the coolest thing
ever
I'm so proud of like my fellow youtubers
cuz every time I come today I look at
the Box section and I never see youtuber
books but today I found Joseph's book
look at him a little legend absolutely
all of the guy so I'm gonna let him take
up an extra space so we can get more
sales then so we've got Joe sugg there
though we've got his sister Zoe with
this book here absolutely well cool and
she's got like a room book club and
everything's all wait where is it John
might these stickers everywhere which is
dead dead cool when I walked in as well
I also know if this Dan T Devon's book
so good like I'm actually well proud of
him like my every youtubers released a
book I'm like so fucking proud it was so
so cool just to see like people I know
and like friends for out the years like
have the books in stores everyone always
ask me like why would I released a book
at the opportunity years ago but I'm
just like I don't read books I just
didn't see the point in release my own
book like that was my common sense way
of walking out it just feels like it's
kind of counterintuitive I will say
sadly couldn't find the Seidman book
what you see Danzig aforethought or buff
come find it
oh my go is it called if you can see
that book it is freezing however I'm
boarding next stop
Hotel is raining you cannot wait to
