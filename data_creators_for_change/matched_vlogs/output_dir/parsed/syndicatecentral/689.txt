on a scale of 1 to cold how is it the
Sun is up my videos up time for me to
get up introducing the replacement for
the YouTube limited edition hoodie my
brand new super dry jacket is looking
nice
it is looking fine and it looks like
it's gonna keep me warm this winter
this is the one I went for it took a
whole 15 seconds of walking in the shot
for me to be like I fall in love and
taking it I do kind of feel like I look
like a sports coach or a PE teacher
ready to rock and roll in a field or
something but I do like it I'm keeping
it
so I'm rocking it days version of agenda
is I'm pretty much extremely late to
everything was supposed to do today I've
gotta go down to the bank get some
paperwork for an accountant sort that
out and once that's done my days when
I've done that that that is it that's
all I need to do but I'm gonna rush
against time because I've only got half
an hour before the bank closes so let's
get on down here another morning where I
can be impressing myself the fact that
I'm walking outside and it's not
nighttime yet this is good this is good
I'm already calling now guarantee the
banks closed like I'm gonna drive all
the way down there it's gonna be close
but it won't be a wasted trip because we
can turn it into an adventure to go and
get milk I ran our milk Oh
flipping it well holy tits on a pancake
did that take it's sweet last time as in
the bank for an hour like the guilt the
poor girls in their life they must have
been like yeah we're finishing work we
get to go home I stood there walked in
and then they were working on my stuff
for an hour every single member of staff
in there was working it's like it's not
anything difficult it's just for that
when you do a tax return you have to get
all this information and then it's like
we need to find out when when you open a
bank out even if you're like how up ten
years always you open a bank however if
you put a pound in and you leave it
there for like year you can get in like
0.001 P so interest so I just need to
know how much interest of my entire life
so it's just like ass giving possible
questions so the other poor fucking
women are there to deal with the bat and
I think we got to bottom of it so now I
can go get some food some starving and
start my fucking day and bye start my
day
the fucking day is almost over cuz it's
nighttime already yeah
Hey oh she's got her eyes open you okay
oh no no you sure no oh yeah I know
right
what it's that time again we're gonna
guess how much right now in the comments
this is gonna cost to refuel I've got a
quarter of a tank in it at the moment
and I want you to guess we've comment
below now last time it was like
40-something pounds but that was because
I had an empty tank now I have a quarter
full tank so leave your comments below
you gotta be able to laugh last time it
was I'm putting in the life fucking fuel
last time it was 40 quid and now this
time what an time to work it out I
managed to put in wait 39 litres and it
came out as 46 pound what the fuck this
is the reason I questioned some of my
friends sometimes I'm like oh that's
kind of taken Apollo room let me let me
when we fought back up there there's
nothing fucking in it is it that
difficult to put it in the bed for
fuck's sake

dad on my own or I just eat this
chocolate covered hmm I really want
occur it but my dad invited me to hit
this house he invited me to my own house
