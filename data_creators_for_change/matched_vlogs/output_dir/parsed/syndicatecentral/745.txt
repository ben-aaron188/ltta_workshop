o'clock in the morning it's not time for

though I would totally love to eat some
chocolate right now you know it's time
for kind of similar but a hot cab rich
chocolate oh my god my dad used to make
me these as a kid you know what I'm
having another one right now it's so
late at night and I'm doing my thing of
why am I going to put the chocolate in
the fridge what I'm doing my thing of
binge what it doesn't even go in this
company though what the fuck am i doing
it goes on the side right next to the
tea sugar coffee and syndicate original
tea that's not an official thing a fan
gave me doing a thing of not live
streaming tonight
I was gonna plan on live-streaming all
day today like all day all night that
was my part of action but I haven't seen
the boys in a long time so I went out
for dinner with them and saw them plus a
tip stream like 910 I was yesterday so I
need a little bit of a break so what I'm
doing instead Zack he's kicking back on
the big TV watching Gotham I'm very very
tempted to go put it on in the cinema
downstairs get my bed in snuggle the
fuck up and just fall asleep watching
Batman watching Gotham on a turgid in to
projector and it's completely black out
down there so no sunlight it's gonna
wake me up no sound gets down there so I
can literally pass the fuck out but I
also made a mistake tonight I left my
patio doors open when the boys around
and all like because it's a it's like a
farm field over there so there's like
midges mosquitos loads of them and
they've all come into the house in the
hundreds so all my walls all this sort
of stuff and I can't exactly go it's
just flat I didn't actually hear because
I can't go cuz flax I'll just have
fucking max I thought of them all so
that kind of sucks but I need your guy's
help over the next few days I'm gonna be
concentrating on the house like I've
lived in here for a long-ass time now
but a lot of it just feels plain and
kind of empty which in a sense is kind
of exactly what I was going for
simplicity you know just simple not lots
Chloe not a lot of maintenance that's
what I like that's why I want but I'm
starting to want to make it a feel a bit
more homey like this kitchen feels great
this section feels too empty so I'm
gonna get like suede cones over here
suede codes over that like suede like
like like my sofa it just feels comfy
and like you know it adds atmosphere to
the room it feels nice and just cozy
like I could add art pieces on air or
something but I wondering like is it
worth painting something on the walls
is it worth hanging in something from
the walls like is it worth having like
adding like trees into the room and
stuff I know I do sound like having a
midlife crisis here but like there's the
little things about the house that I
just haven't got round to doing yet and
I want to get round to doing I want to
finish it I want to make it happen like
for example there's a TV but after
living here for two years I still
haven't got a unit to put all and wires
into it with like I haven't hung over
this painting there's goddamn PSVita
here I think it's about time that
started concentrating on this damn house
like I love it to pieces and it deserves
my time and my attention but that can
fucking wait because I'm turning the
lights off enjoying my hot chocolate
I'm watching Gotham ah next day I look
like I got no sleep with these black
lines of my eyes because what I said i
watching Gotham that was at like
midnight and went ahead and watched
Gotham and ended up watching like eight
episodes worth like four episodes
because the thing right now along and I
was up to like four o'clock in the
morning so now it's 1 o'clock and I'm
absolutely exhausted I want to go back
to bed bought that would not be a smart
decision so I'm gonna enter this vlog so
thank you very much for watching I hope
you enjoyed the vlog if you do think I
should get a Jaguar then let me know
with a like rating and if you think I
should get something more like that
meets my style being like an off-road
vehicle there I can put my mountain
bikes on this stuff uh let me know in
the comments down below I think that we
really really cooled see what people say
cause like I don't live in an area where
a performance cars like gonna get the
most out of its used but the same time
it's a really nice vehicle to use but at
the same time if I had like a Jeep or a
lot over or some like that
I think that would be like really really
really cool cuz I love that sort of
off-road II feel car so I don't know
we'll see how things go sorry I think
you're watching mutual leave like Chris
scrap I'll see you guys tomorrow at 6
p.m. UK time for the next daily vlog
whoop
