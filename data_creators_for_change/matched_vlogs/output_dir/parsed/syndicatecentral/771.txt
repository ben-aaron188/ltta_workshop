other book Nick is here watching my vlog
and we talked about him watching my vlog
so vlog section so how did you enjoy
that porn this hos funny like that this
one was funny I was looking at some of
this and I was thinking to myself that
looks like we fucking planned and staged
it and the time just everything is just
random on the moment in it fucking so
much me and Nick have decided to uh
sneak on into the local pub for a quick
but loose thank you so you are going to
treat this trip no I'm gonna drink this
trip we're going to Island tomorrow I'm
drinking it you have to go to Ireland
and drink drink another is not look at
this place interesting there's Olympics
there's lies there's everything look at
this is a goddamn DJ booth over in my DJ
oh my god live karaoke every Friday and
Saturday what is it
what the hell's going on front well what
the hell's going on why is no-one
singing that's what I'm talking about
it's like nearly midnight and we're
watching the Britain sets a world record
cycling for the win
that is truly nothing
the exiting music of Champions now all
we need to do is Hotwire that's golf
done we're settin ik I reckon we should
soup it up to extra batteries our May 4
similarly my Lao still be quicker than a
car so ok this is the next day but I'm
ending this vlog right now I just
quickly say there's a lot of people in
the comments like Tom this is supposed
to be a Pokemon go trip but the roads
that were taken 1 we have no signal our
phones - there's no Pokemon stops
there's no Pokemon anywhere so
fortunately we've not had a lot of luck
catching the pokemons but one of the
main points of this trip fall program in
the first place is to go over to island
because that's where mini light actually
caught is Gyarados so i'm gonna try and
find the location of where he actually
caught it and see if we can replicate
that i'll make it happen if i can catch
that then that's the perfect add-on to
the trip but no worse I'm gonna wrap up
today's vlog I'm a bit good that I
didn't manage to get an Instagram photo
of the meet up in Glasgow today just
because it was that many people it was
so difficult to organize everyone like
hey guys can move over here like there
was that many people that it just it was
impossible so unfortunately I didn't get
that one Matt the group dab so I'm sorry
about that and I'm trying to stay away
from the dabbing all around the UK it's
like it was fun the first time then the
second time never might expect it to be
a thing and I'm like I'm not trying to
make this like cheesy just dabbing
everywhere so I'm just like looking
forward to the next Meetup should be
better Belfast and Dublin so make sure
you follow me on Twitter links in the
description you can stay updated as to
when I'm doing these meals so until then
thank you very much for watching and
good bye
