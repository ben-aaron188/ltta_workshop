monster and two gingerbread man oh and a
tub of gravy oh and the sausage yeah I
went all in being British today but yeah
chip boys by the way there's a question
for you guys when you go to a chip-in
this is 12 my British people no one else
could answer this question when you go
to the trip it what do you get
oh snap we back in here and now the
problem with the AC where that was
blasting cold air on me there's now been
switched to that one takes out the air
and that one puts in here so no longer
am i freezing my ears up awesome here my
dad also put the wires back in the walls
as you can see and filled them in I'm
gonna pay them over and smooth them over
so you'll be able to see that and then
might get this wall painted green so I
can do a green screen background office
is evolving also come we called up desk
sorry my videos that I was talking about
I wanted to get on these desks from John
Lewis and probably they do better
and they were like yo we might send you
one if you're interested so we'll see
how in a couple of weeks if they
actually do 71 so until then we're stuck
in this mud bog which is great but I do
really want the move index and as for
wire management and we need to work on
that if someone's got some advice as to
what to do with all that please
immediately let me oh man this is
looking mighty fine look at this
absolutely looks like someone has a
house here and actually occupies this
place look at the garden down here put
in Nebraska and straight line damn it's
like it like a painting like a piece of
art right now right there yeah this
looking mighty fine very very happy with
the choices I made there just got a
phone call my dad that he's got his
hands on some electric pedal bikes so
I'm gonna go over to his house now check
them out and maybe have a little bit of
a drive around on them not too sure what
to expect because I think I don't think
they're like fully electric I think
they're kind of like ride assist ones
and I think it's something I've seen
like fouseytube used before but never
used one before so we're gonna go check
it out well my goodness there they are
holy snap look at the size of them these
are the two crows that have been
terrorizing my house but the scary thing
is right you only see two right there
you know oh yeah there is only two no
apparently they've had a baby and it's
even bigger than them somehow let's get
him let's get him let's slowly run them
over let's uh get back here get back
here I don't fuckin run you over no on
earth is this go on Graham give us a
spiel explain what these are it allows
people like me your vet to get something
faster fit people so it does it let you
go how much speed restricted to 17 miles
Oh 17 miles per hours rather than a
rather than you can't press the button
anyway yeah yeah so it's like for going
up hills and stuff like that it's easy
basically so somewhere exactly Tony
needs I catch a bitch Hey all right so
what I'm going to do is in a ride pass
just normally pedaling and you'll see
what it's like and then I'm gonna use
the boost function so you could be like
70 miles per hour on this thing
this is without the boost this is with
the boost Gustav Gustav it helps that
your weighs a lot freestone as long on
it yeah go go faster go all right so
we're on for miles per hour
look I'm just slogging away like this
but if I press the button it makes it
easier then easier then easier then you
just get stupidly fast goes up to 8
cents 70 miles per hour I just get up to
20 that's pretty cool
I try again oh we're cheating talk to
her crash walkie now it's well good
all right this is the test Graham no
boost Tony boost you ready 3 2 1 go it's
so much easier and these two it really
fit riders with our games but I'm sorry
sorry Tony but the boost is just so good
it's definitely one of the coolest
looking bikes I've seen of it get on it
