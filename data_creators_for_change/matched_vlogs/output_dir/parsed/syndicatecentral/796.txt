since I read a book this will be the
first youtubers book I've read I should
be pretty cool hey Joe I like the fitti
looks cool all in 3d whatever but if you
take a look over here oh my goodness me
look at that that's amazing
not exactly sure what's fully going on
here but my gosh is that incredible Luke
after all this time you know that art on
that wall that like it looks like a
bunch of guys throwing dicks at each
other it's actually called a vicious
rumble that's what it's detected as in
the Pokemon go stop it's a vicious
rumble mate
damn didn't know you had a million
subscribers first are to go shut up to
the homies well Luke just got his new
old table and chairs for his office
didn't you get some art for the walls
Hey well oh is that it can you does it
work yeah really
you let your line
I don't know I'm speaking to high pitch
but damn dude this was real nice I like
the wooden touch what in class looks
good let's come up on let's go wait in
for Alan to stop playing with his
goddamn hockey stick and set up this HTC
five for me why is it not working on
that's working did you play hockey no I
thought you were professional hey well
these two sticks you want to go play
yeah I'm sure Angela won't kick our
asses for playing with the sticks but
yeah we'll be fine
oh we set it up I can't wait to play
this thing I'm basically just gonna sit
on a chair over them being healthy I'm
just gonna sit down and play it is it
working I don't know I don't know you
pull you into all this aah
the HTC fight is driving me crazy it's
currently unplug my charger not working
so we've got two different headsets
they've got two different everything
we're trying to get it up and running
it's been like four fucking hours and
it's still not rocking and rolling so
eventually I'll be able to go downstairs
and enjoy until that I'm going on the
roof and sitting in the Sun we out here
on the rooftops kicking up some dishes
in grabbing some chairs I don't know why
there's two random chairs just observing
me why is there two chairs just randomly
observing the tray in mine because I'm
facing that way to get some Sun no this
office right here is 3bd now we own two
floors of this four we've just taken
over this entire building down here and
this is gonna be like a live streaming
building I like gaming so all that sort
of stuff like any productions we need to
shoot and stuff so that's gonna be all
as well which is hey that's pretty nice
he says pretty good so as soon as that
gets taken over I'm gonna have like a
whole live-streaming gaming rig in there
and I could not wait it's like I'm like
all the way in the distance when you see
the coast I'm all the way over there
after travel like an hour and a half
every day to travel all the way to here
but then once I'm here I can just work
from there and then if we do we might
pick up a this is all like places where
you can live we might rent one of these
spaces for the company so like people
who like work late or something they can
just stay here so that's a trouble so I
could probably like stop at this place
like a bunch of times I like just wake
up go to work wake up go to work that's
our thing so hopefully it all pans out
perfectly and I do not rip this cable
man I've been on the roof now kick you
back for about two hours
don't know I I probably stupidly
suntanned but every about 20 minutes I
get a width of sewage just flicked up in
the air so it's been pretty a pretty
fascinating to be opened unless I've
gained a follow-up Lucas now joined me
to kick back on the rhythm we'll go get
some food soon a maybe go out Pokemon
hunt again tonight don't worry
everyone's freaked out the vlogs being
like it's only Pokemon go is my Pokemon
go but it is Pokemon go in this Pokemon

shit happens alright in my opinion I
mean lapd's on tours get the fuck out of
it I'm pretty sure they're filming for
traffic anyway is it a triple fucking

ceiling roof Jesus I'm gonna take that
as a sign to get the fuck down stairs

going to look plain and simple I don't

where they put liquid nitrogen to make
your ice cream you go above and beyond
