rude hitting the Pokemon ball with that
one second let me just load up my
whistle good god dammit my ears are
ringing
so when you get taught to whistle is
like I can whistle in words I can
whistle through my teeth
and I taught myself to do this whistle
which actually nearly got me kicked out
of school because the day I like the
week where I was learning to do it I was
doing this it just didn't it didn't
sound right but I could tell that it was
about to be a whistle and then one day I
was walking past the exam room and it
turned into this
now it's the loudest what I can do is
even louder than do it on my fingers I
can do it on every single finger as well
that's pretty good back outside Sony

health like by half light within like
two seconds of every five right I got my
Ultima ready okay go it right hold on

an Altima cannot confirm but we kind of
maybe think that that is the upgrade
from Charmander we don't know which
direction to go give it that way that
way or that way so you've got a bit pick
a direction and if it's not there then
we have to go in the opposite direction
trailer I reckon you should go left

mean while me and Luca driving down
alleyways collecting Pokemon go stops
and catching pokémon driving around at 4
miles per hour
I'm gone it doesn't get much dirtier
than this my friend that's a fact so
apparently this trick where you rename
an EVs so a name because it's apparently
an easter egg let you like get the
specific one so you want to get the
flame version of the ETA right yeah so
you've gotta name it pyro apparently it
should give Luke what he wants so holy
shit that's a lot of Pokemon 201 Pokemon
like Lonnie I might when you tried some
of the men you know give it more a bit
of freedom for fuck's sake wave truth
evolve this mothertrucker
if it turns into a flame on the easter
egg is real apparently has been proven
on reddit that's real but we're gonna
find out for ourselves right here right
now is it going to be the one with the
Flaming tail all the floating I don't
know I think this got flaming for it I
get stupid on oh it is right yeah is it
is that the one you wanted you know what
my way from fucking now I know these
