it is 842 in the morning and I'm trying
to go to sleep so the only way to make
this happen is by going the fuck to
sleep like to consider myself a risk
taker and today I am taking a risk I
completely run out hair gel you might be
like it just doesn't sound fucking
dangerous but I only usually use one
hair gel and it's a tawny guy like
proper spikey strong stuff but I've run
out of it like all the audience is going
to use this is like the best hair gel
stuff ever super strong super useful
right now now I'm gonna be trying Old
Spice Forge put this is probably gonna
fail and you'll see me crying in ten
minutes when it does ah it's not as good
as I was hoping I thought it'd be much
stronger but it's much like a a weaker
pace enjoy all those lads and ladies out
there who spiked the hair up you'll
understand that if you spike arrow
properly you need some thick shit to
stick it up with so I'll spice Forge you
guys let me down this goes out a date
June 28 this one goes out of date July
5th perfect I'm sick of Ivanoff it to
snack on in this house so I decided to
step my game up and get some top ramen
ramen
I've aiming but either way I'm gonna try
this and hopefully it's good poodles
acquired which I think I may have like
really really overdone because one my
ball is on absolutely fine a broad pile
in hot water or into it and then
microwaved it as well and it doesn't
seem to like there's that much flavor in
it but every way I'm finally doing a
gaming video on my main channel even if
I get something I don't get something
I'm opening 20 gamer cases so let's get
unboxing video on the girl and get to
day out of rogues I'm actually feeling
like I want to make more gaming videos

that's why I'm gonna do to you yeah
trying to blind John Purvis bitch here
we see Luke Angelo and Evan having a
small business conversation oh this is
crazy I am so close to ten million
subscribers on my main youtube channel
this is the one YouTube channel has died
that I thought was gonna be the only
YouTube channel I ever had if there was
anything that could have changed it
would be that I did my daily vlogging on
this channel but because I already made
my vlogging channel and this was my
gaming channel I was happy I separated
the two but to think that this 9 9 9 9
is all about to change to 1-0 and just
gained an extra number is absolutely
insane will probably see someone
unsubscribe whilst I'm doing this but
that is insane to see and think that I'm
so close to 10 million subscribers
another vlog is like me showing my life
and all that sort of stuff and I just
want to take a second to say thank you
to everyone who I like it and found me
through the syndicate project and then
subscribe to my vlogging channel because
a lot of people have the whole premise
of like oh you forget about the people
who made you are who you are today sort
of thing and I don't want to look at it
like that at all I I respect him some of
the same but like I'm a youtuber I'm
still the same person I still make the
same sort of videos I may be different
videos like gaming vlogging like I still
make videos because I want to make the
many people enjoy that content that I'm
doing exactly what I want to do and
people enjoying exactly what I'm doing
and so I just want to thank everyone who
supported me along the way with whatever
I've done rather than hating on me for
not doing something I was known for in
the past I never want to be stuck and
forced doing the one thing that I used
to do and I want to move forward in life
progressing to new things where it is I
made a gaming channel I got 10 million
subscribers I went to twitch I got 2
million followers
I made a vlogging channel which is on 2
million subscribers like I want to be
able to branch out him as many different
things as possible and you guys have all
made that possible so thank you so much
for how far you got me and we'll
continue to see what the fuck we're
doing live because I'm the most random
person will gets 10 million subscribers
and uploads a video every other two
weeks rather than every day because why
I just feel like it and I appreciate you
guys respect and understanding that so
oh my God we're so close haha my new
package has arrived and I'm gonna let
your guess what it is it's not the hell
the worst cut ever judge should know of
or expect bought there's a clue right
there
yeah for the record I basically just
found it it's another one of those
speakers if you guys didn't I've got
these sono speakers that you can put all
around the house and you connect your
Wi-Fi can control it for your phone
basically the absolutely fucking epic
now I'm not sponsored to say this
they're just really fucking good but
when I bought my house in the UK like I
paid a lot of money to put like speakers
all in my ceiling and you have to like
for an existing house you have two holes
in the ceiling all that start stuff up
when you build a new house after room
wires everywhere whereas if you get one
of these are a few of these you can just
put them absolutely everywhere around
your building and just play music
wherever you want so there's one there
above my bed kiss it there there's one
above my bed there was one in the
kitchen and now I'm putting one in my
bathroom let's plug over here so in the
bathroom I just love music so it's
absolutely perfect oh this is driving me
crazy

going up and down for the past 200
