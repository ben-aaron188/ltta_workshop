hot life for me and I'm going to burn

mountains super clear I would have been
a great start to the day I walked all
the way from there to there and was like
why am I missing something fucking left
you on the side dinner I'm an idiot the
bridge of majesticness is majestic I
actually thought this would be a good
idea to like dive into this water if
you're like drunk or something but it's
that's a really nasty and you know it
what's the point in a being dirty water
when there's four goddamn pools over
there we made a really good decision Jay

was not expecting that I am officially

the only reason the only way to get rid
of food coma J it's son yeah I worked

right now oh that's a lot of golf clubs
this hotel was absolutely awesome

it time to hit the road and travel home
and stupidly halt in this castle I don't
want to get in the middle of absolutely
got Dane nowhere where temperatures
outside Jay
one away oh my gosh it's work shorts
t-shirt and I'm still sweaty barks up
with a/c on Jeff is convinced that
they're powering a secret military base
of some sort I just think they're here
for no reason to kill pigeons No thank
you for getting a closer look off the
turbines boys decided oh wait that's
quite a
the drones fine but we did crush its J
Scout now luckily that wasn't from the
drone but this little mic that you can
see there that is from the drone plastic
leg so what clays replacing this
windshield so it's fine but still sucks
like we crashed into the fucking car now
we're taking some photos of everything
yeah back in the city of Los Angeles
downtown is pretty and we're gonna head
to Marina del Rey to go get some food
I'm absolutely good job and driving for
like three hours like a beast holy shit
I of course fell asleep after playing
Justin Bieber songs and J was not happy
where you would not impress my music
selection so I love I lost jobs core
privileges I got out the cars with phone
up for gas and look to that guy and he
just like not into my said I do man all
right he said have you got a lighter I
was like what the wire look markings
absolutely laughing himself in hysterics
yes that's the kind of joke you make
when you drive around fumer all day well
do you spot right now EA games oh my god
give kiss I won't lose apparently I
don't know dad that make sense right I
got you JJ man this is a good ass
looking meal right here Jeffrey thank
you so much for an awesome trip I've
gotta get inside this apartment
otherwise I'm literally I'm gonna shit
myself in a pleasure give me a hug yes
till next time I think we may be
planning to go off to Canada fairly soon
possibly next week so that should be
pretty sick going in helicopters so if
that goes ahead I will see you then I
love your face thanks for driving
thanks being a legend and someday yeah
maybe in a few days just don't get it I
literally do not get it how the hell are
these balloons still up as a kid are
throughout my entire life whenever I had
a balloon it would always just deflate
within a day that's stupid and these
motherfuckers they put up for months
oh maybe maybe weeks but but the Hat
time to see if the drone still works
because the wind was that strong it
looked like I crashed it but the wind
was that strong that when it came down
it bumped into the actual car was like
bang and then set it flying sideways and
I lost signal so I couldn't control it
so we're gonna see because it damaged
one of the blades as you can see here
like the rest are fine and it doesn't
look bent or anything but it lost
the top of it so I don't know if that's
gonna affect it or damage it or anything
but look what I've got spare ones I'm
gonna have to check whether or not I
actually still flies because when you
turn the rotors like these all feel fine
but one of them had collected quite a
bit listen
like there's sand collected in it so and
we're trying to turn on the rover and
well first of all clean it out turn on
the rotor and see if we can get it
spinning almost there's gonna be issues
but a little bit of Sun but the tan is a
little bit of anything could disrupt the
entire thing so laughter wait and see
ooh I have to send it into digital okay
BG I broke it to help by moment of truth
boys let's see if it will work okay it
says cannot take off the screw it we're
gonna see if you'll take off anyway
probably a really bad idea
another balloon Oh No
I'm gonna wreck the balloon
okay seems fine it seems to be fine I
can't tell whether because my a C's on
it's making the drone kind of go
sideways a little bit I thought I just
turned it off then but it clearly didn't
because the drone seems to be going that
way a little bit so I don't know whether
that's the rotor or something like that
or whether it's just the a so almost one
o'clock in the morning I am so excited
to be back in my own bed like I said I
keep going on these traveling trips and
only spending one night at a time in my
bed which may even make sense again
