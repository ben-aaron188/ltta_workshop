they got pancakes oh my god think that's

give it to Jeff that is pretty good damn
suspect I took a bite out of it look at
the inside
it doesn't pancakes and bacon and some
eggs and even this good that should not
look like that okay a review on the
breakfast I'm gonna give the breakfast a
four out of ten wasn't anything
incredible but look at this view though
that is incredible alright breakfast
with a view four and a half I'm just
going to take this in for a second guys
so I'll catch you in a minute you know
what if we actually crashed
I wouldn't I like started sinking I
wouldn't get in the boat I'd swim to one
of these little rock islands over here I
think I'd be my safest bet or nothing
I'm a fast woman I could make it I fell
asleep inside because I was so damn
exhausted but I came out and look at the
color of this water he's genuinely like
straight blue and when I say warm pretty
sure this is the ocean but woke up like
one yeah we said that the scenery is
beautiful but like I don't think I've
ever seen ocean water that clear
Wow so nice I got incredibly excited and
I thought that said hot chocolate and I
clicked it and it was just hot water
oh look alive is a sound show yourself
maybe it's not all that that says like
piss
so we'll wait for that now this doesn't
help the stereotype but scones oh my god
our scones they're so good
creme Jam this is amazing time to
attempt a hot chocolate with milk pretty
nice it was your wild Jeffrey taking
photograph of the back of the ship
that's what you call a big-ass chimney
and you see to your left some rock and
water look to your right
some are rock and some more water
brilliant the boat trip is over so we
head in to camp upper hand and now just
go wait for all the cars to reverse out
and then we can reversal out and we do
it to go Oh boys boys boys boys alive
not to reverse we go up
actually can't write on my camera cannot
go so at the same time we're off
let the races begin we've got two days
and we've got six hours to get to
Queenstown and we've got loads of things
you want to see on the way so this is
going to check a Swedish matter to an
interesting vehicle I like it I like Kai
Ora and welcome to the South Island of
la puna Moo
probably ruin that name but we made it
and it looks exactly like the North
Island not gonna lie I was expecting
much difference many impressive time to
top it with some fuel and admire the
view
this feels like Angelo nailed it on the
head it feels like we're in Hawaii here
right Oh - st. where the hell are we
right now we're on the way to an
electronics store to try and find one
drone propellers around drugs he's gonna
need a million drone batteries for me
and a gimbal friends'll strong as well
as a chat and in cloud charger Jon as
well so we're hopefully trying to find
somewhere we just went into one town and
it said it had three electronic stores
and it was goddamn none of them none of
them exist that we're all abandoned so
that sucks whilst were on the road I got

clouds just coming over it looks like
that place in Cape Town when it comes up
like the rolling rolling clouds I don't
even
tabletop Maui looks like that wow so
nice much wow how many impress right so
apparently that wasn't the Blue Lake
that we were looking for so we're going
to this visitor center to try and find
out whatever help we need to go so I
think you are here we went there we're
looking for a thing called Blue Lake
um not seeing any signs of it just yet
what is going on I was not expecting
we're here and that was the like we were
looking at and the Blue Lake does exist
but it's a 15 hour hike all the way up
here all the way up here all the way to
the top thoughts not having any we could
do it but we don't have 15 hours to
spare so one day we shall return
nobody's around here so this gives me
the perfect opportunity to do rose holy
shit the echo for days
you
guys doing down that comfy nicely cuts
the roof - look at this insane view the
drone battery died but nonetheless we
made it up onto the roof which hopefully
we're not gonna fall through and okay we
just can appreciate have you never sent
back this is useless as dick Smith we
found out they got solar panels on the
roof and we still can't use it to charge
a fucking drone batteries wise boys
listen to some tunes
I've been dabbing on the roof literally
we just had a dance session on the roof
it was magnificent angela was filming
loads of footage not too sure what he's
gonna do with it but wait you guys gonna
drive off with me on the roof oh shit
okay I'm ready let's do this when in
doubt shake the roof shaking look how
much I'm shaking it I'm probably gonna
tip it over and be like New Zealand
tourist board soda helicopter we're
screwed
Chad says New Zealand tourist board
Tommy's looks like there's a new killer
bomb going off
holy tits yeah I'm definitely shoot
knotted dread of all pulled up on the
side of the road again because we found
a sick filming location look at the sky
we found like a little waterfall over
here late going through and all that and
then the most beautiful burning sky ever
this is ridiculous
like New Zealand you go I don't think to
like do as much like crazy activities
rather than just to appreciate the world
we live in and you know what right now
I appreciate the world I live in so much
I feel like the Santa Claus of alcohol
right now beautiful views and taking in
the alcohol for the road we've got like
seven hours worth of traveling to do
right now so we have a crate of 24 beers
that's one for every 20 minutes I don't
know if that's just the drunk alcoholism
math I made right then but yeah we gotta
get on the road
got a long amount of time to catch up
before we get to Christchurch tomorrow
so let's get going these guys are doing
high exposure photos outside so whilst
they're doing that take it forever
I'm going to take three minutes to cook
myself through these fucking noodles
because these noodles are actually
amazing so I'm using about all I've got
left but this looks like was straight
but this is how we actually last one in
so I'm having to lean on the pan so it
doesn't slide off whilst I'm cooking the
noodles Lord the vyjit returns I'm still
making the noodles
I can't move from this position up till
the door for me to let them in and I
couldn't let them in because it would
have slowed up you go well one look at
the forwards are doing a minute
either way the noodles going in
unfortunately the microwave doesn't work
when we stopped along the gas cooker you
devastated no no dogs on a Dyson Omega
Man are you gonna make it this no who
does a little endian look tasty as hell
he made like a cross on sandwich he's
mixing something together and that is
the best cheese firmer I've ever used in
my life right so we have got 510
comments to go and that could take us
six hours six o'clock now we're gonna
get there at 1 o'clock morning all right
you ready Angela I am
you ready Jay yeah I'm ready and thank
you for the 20k on yeah oh there we go
here we go it's 20 count instead
cheers to the road let's go
well apart from it smell like fire we're
going to other smokes coming from
because there's a takeaway with houses
across the road he did not do his
homework but we found somewhere that
says not accommodation it says take
aways so going in here and get some grub
ok so this is how menu for the night you
know the fire blowing right but I
thought a career old is that each other
go
as well as through gene tendency whilst
we're waiting for food I thought good
idea would be to get a beer not only for
myself my good friend over there I could
be an amazing cameraman and Angelo
cheers to a six-hour drive ahead cheers
my friend to that to the apple juice no
alcohol so the road cream soda
hey real man hoorah

because it was like oh Tom we need the
shots I was like okay we need the shot I
get the shot I've got to try and find
the crossing that I made over here so no
it was a safe path over and I know that
every single ripple you've seen this
water means there's a large rock
therefore it's safer to cross and I
cross right near this bush over here so
I've now got to cross through this water
ready without hopefully dropping my
phone all right you ready let's do this
deep this is deep water by the way okay
do not drop the phone do not drop the
phone
this is uptight my knees and this is
fast running water look look in the
