it's a new dawn it's a new day in New
Zealand the weather is looking beautiful
clearly rained in the night the
campervan is moist as hell but it's time
to start this day and get this show on
the road
how would you impact this this morning
boys good cocoa pups
I hope is the exact same as England
because then I'll be happy the guys are
getting ready it's like 7:30 the morning
we go out and snapped a nice little
screw girl at window look out on my
window that is amazing this is like some
straight loitering stuff right now
got the nice humid mist fog rolling in
over the hills look beautiful well I got
the the drone all update on my phone the
controllers ready to rock and roll
homages put the blades on the actual
drone itself and do it we're ready to
rock and roll boys hope we should order
a million spares of these in case I
break them all but it's ready to rock
and the weather is not ready to roll so
being a Jeff keep doing this like mud
obstacles to get down from this bunk bed
and I was like we've got to be missing
some of air there has to be a ladder
Angelo and I notice this guy and I
looked alright so fucking ladder during
the night I fell out the fucking bed
look at that core god damn out of a save
Mia fall all the blades on this cloud is
actually coming in so I'm not looking
forward to that
it's I'm tempted not to fly it but we'll
try and set off land and see we can get
the show on the road
you
a strong fight pretty sweet actually
seems really really easy to operate the
return home works and feel pretty stake
now Angelo's playing with his big boy
toy whilst I'm stuck with a well or a
little kid kid version so either way
we'll find out who crushes the first one
first oh yeah now it stops raining his
perfect drunk condition but we're
packing up we're ready to rock and roll
we got to flip the water there's a
reading lounge okay I read this
completely wrong there's a reading room
and a TV lounge I'm gonna check it out
us in a cafe and seeing if there's a
toilet there's also a pool over there
but I would assume that's freezing cords
I'm not gonna mess with that this looks
pretty damn nice hell is nothing oh man
but people everywhere Antoine just came
down here and said hello that was pretty
awesome he was in the like local
neighborhood and just rock walk come
down and just as we're leaving him I
kept him before we're we had to bounce
so I put water in a in a door a
campervan and off we go
top it up the water got it plugged in
ready to rock go turn off the gas and
then we're rolling five seconds later we
already stood can we reverse our smooth
wood come on come on come on don't stop
there we go

reason oh this already feels kind of
weird

many horror films for this to all just
go so damn wrong
this place is absolutely incredible like
incredible it's stupidly nice I'm so
impressed
there's our ride that was so awesome so
he just went all the way up from the top
and then through this cave and like the
blue glow worms in the ceiling we'll
just do it do it insane like even if I
filmed with my phone or a camera you're
probably not seen unless out like a DSLR
and turn the exposure like absolutely
crazy
so it was nice to see it but when we go
up stuff I'll film like a picture
something so you can actually see what
it looks like with like what large
exposure good right that was very good
that was absolutely beautiful
that's what the glowworm look like not
as crazy but it did look just like that
I'm the way I'm conscious of is like
soldered and he said if we ever come
back his family owns like a cave system
like we just came out of and we can go
on it but he also wants me to sign his
phone with a sharpie you serious you
sure there's no going back

question for you
waterto fucking ahead of you brother

need to drone out the sky is surrounded
by beautiful things God wow that is

damn son we just decided to randomly
pull up on the middle of this road
because it's like a really nice like
straight road oh it was as a turn but it
jumped out and doing photo shoots in the
middle of the road this guy's trying to
get like dope photos Angela's trying to
get dope oh oh so this is like all the
action shot behind the scenes of the
photos you see on Instagram like

instagram yet we'll be down in

shit is like it's unreal Oh Jeff wasn't
lying
and I sweep on the location Wow Wow
why look at the view and you can fly a
drone in it can see it for you if you
look absolutely mesmerized just what's
going on right now he's flying the drone
man find the fucking drop okay that's
actually a picture in itself trust him
but I'm just gonna film in case he
crashes it
he's just having to take off nourish a
lot of tree
you
yep and we crush the
already and I think the motors are
burning out so really you can turn it
off okay time to find a dying drone
literally stop recording for a second
and the drone is dying alright so the
drone camera looks fine
this blades fine but like that blade
broke that blade broke that one's fine
holy shit you got wet you comprised
honestly cannot believe I didn't record
that like he flew it out like
dangerously but he did it and I'd like
sweet there's gonna be no issues
whatsoever he's gonna kill it he killed
the drone but he but he flew it out and
for some reason he's had to fly it back
in straight away after bein like oh yeah
the sticks feel great
hit this bush and he went straight down
luckily he regarded from his POV that's
what you saw
I'm saying this yeah I'm saying that
hopefully you've already seen it in this
video so what a fucking sausage but this
is so beautiful New Zealand is amazing

this whole thing is ridiculous

I'm actually so happy to see it work and
I was so upset for Angela thinking he
broken it we made it to camp ground -
this is base camp for the night the
drones are good but we need to charge
them so we're gonna find ourselves a
little spot plug in the cable and not
feed the ducks um that is totally a
rabbit running around I was like what
the hell is that little dot burning my
eyes were burning up ah Lister I was
full holy shit that's so cute so I did
manage to get recorded but I was out
flying mine as well so it was Angelo's
and for some reason Angelo what at 90
miles per hour into a tree and it's the
life yeah no fucking way which one's did
you break last time which propellers oh
yeah same ones oh oh it's got so much
mud in it my little phantom 4 is like

that the actual place is filled with
smoke it's part of a pattern jeweler's
plan to kill us with flavor of taste and
smoke Angela's cooked as a fatty snake
so yeah I cook noodles bitch-ass noodles
and you cook a fine art steak like a
true dad like a true dad look at that
hula and by the way for the record it's
really good
but I'm gonna rate it out of 10 oh all
right it smells incredible it looks
incredible
hmm
it actually tastes incredible I'm gonna
give you an eight point four and the
reason why I'm not giving you an eight
point five is because the peppercorns
are so goddamn big then I'm crunching
them how's the crust eight point four
that make you feel Angelo

top of the tank cheers my friend

steak we'll see how this one goes Angelo

on me
don't bother me Jeff watching networks
