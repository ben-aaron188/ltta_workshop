well how it's been awesome I love you to
pieces be in one piece whilst I'm gone
and survive and enjoy me not ruining you
but until next time this times going in
my taxi and head to the airport so about
five years ago I started uploading
videos to YouTube and people watch them
and over time it grew and grew and grew
and then that earned me revenue through
advertisements and then I got a gaming
company in that way which is where I'm
flying to now Los Angeles and loads of
other random stuff thank you very much
sir this is what I'm saying this is why
I don't need extra thing to carry with
me I forgot my watch already I'm
probably gonna lose it on this trip like
when I go to iscariot I'll just be tired
and I'll leave it behind
just like that made it to the airport
terminal 3 I am getting better and
better at timing getting to the airport
because now I've got an hour before I
fly Flynn it your time to check-in put
any attempt to chill out and relax this
is where all these people queuing I just
awkwardly won't pass the ball OOP look
at the size of their backpacks
I was tiny made it through security
heading out to delight the shops area
city's any new cameras or anything in
there available if not just gonna go and
sit down in the airport lounge and get
drunk well that's a good sign
sale I just got beyond excited over this
because I could take all the footage of
my iPhone throughout my laptop so easily
and edit it just by using this on the go
apparently reviews say is terrible
correct if you want my number one shout
whilst flying or being tired and just
feeling awesome get tired eye drops you
thank me later
it was the first time I use the brush
always lunch in Manchester Airport so
far looks pretty dumb smooth and if you
know is I try my best to whisper whoa
darhk's absolutely proves it
I'm pretty sure that was the biggest
plane in the world that just landed
there that's like the Emirates a380
Airbus which is just tank but every time
an airport I don't have my headphones in
I always talk dead quietly because as
soon as you start speaking without
headphones everyone turns around she was
like why is he filming himself like this
guy here every time I go through
security now this is what I've got
checked out I've still got headphones
passport phone UK phone local syndicate
respond wallet most important thing
right here I'm a new watch this I
guarantee I end up losing on this trip
look isn't should it looks absolutely
beautiful but guarantee end of business
true the fact that I already walked out
my front door this morning without it
it's just like oh it's last time when I
flew to LA I left my headphones on the
flight because I don't usually carry big
headphones so I'm more used to these
ones so I took these ones off the plane
with me and left my big ones on there
sorry razor are you guys ready to say
hello to my new vlogging setup cutter
see nice and big and bulky and holds on
to it just fine so it doesn't fall out
right really grip it but then look at
that I got a little baby girl GoPro
and gorilla man so if I go somewhere I
want to do like a time-lapse or just
like film talking to it without holding
the camera just have it looking at me
I can just do that and it's nice and
small you should put it in my pocket
I'll put in the bag problem solved so
this is me now officially using this for
the first time ever because there's so
many times that I might just want to sit
down to a Q&A and it was after like get
like a bottle lucozade and then balance
my phone against it and ends up slipping
and falling but now I've got this like
little rig that I can just set up with
it's bloody perfect
you see rather than getting in that key
there I'm just going to sit here for 10
minutes and let it disappear my planes
not exactly gonna go anywhere
why stand when you can we
a very good afternoon ladies
London London time to head to the lounge
chill out from it because my flight is
not terrible three o'clock to LA so I
just keep back
time to learn from last time gonna drop
a bag off because I've got two hours to
wait and she got wander on the airport I
just drop this off here and come back in
a bit

absolutely awesome let's watch the
planes taking off speed glass thing
across bar and then over here because
it's your huge selection of just free
drinks Jameson
this is how I'm gonna become an
alcoholic whilst flying around the world
blaze it all right so now I'm heading to

doing with a large eaten drunk sounds to
get the plane and chill the hell out
hey there's my old friend Lee if you
guys remember this this is the plane

the plane that I got on but I like first

Airbus a380 so you get on it it's got
like HDTVs and USBs and but a look
at the pilots I can see your face my
flight to allies from a different gate

chill it out into the road passing out
whatever I feel like it give the plan
I'm gonna watch some movies in standby
to the enemy we're gonna cook in corner
since 1886 we're talking 40 nice to live
in like how the toilets in any kind of
thing this stuff just was watching the
film Everest
downtempo
given much public on I was in business
class this is first class
no Russell luggage nice move pro tip
when you're ever London lax do this
always run if you wonder in ROI is
because when you get to the end of this
its immigration and immigration usually
take about two hours so the quicker you
get there the less people in front of
you so realistically every person full
of you is five minutes I'm not even
kidding it's ridiculous next pro tip
always take the stairs
thank God the queues are too bad this is
usually awful but because I run it's not
this probably the fastest I've ever got
to the front of the queue hands down the
quickest ever got through that chaos
their madness look how busy is holy
thank God I escaped all that I got I got
through here so damn fast look it's just
waiting for me empties book no I did get
me that recorded I just did it like a
big speech and the guy who films for TMZ
just run past me with a badge on oh
that's good sorry well I get attached
into the apartment that might have been
the quickest I've ever got through the
airport security there ever since I
first recorded the clip saying like make
sure you run as fast as you can it took
me 20 minutes to get through the entire
security everything like that so
successful oh I could tell he in in and
out right now I got so much mail god
damn I never usually get this much mail
when I go back to the UK but I'm back
hopefully the keys still work to it I've
not been evicted what the hell is this
the Mun live is give me a doorman honey
I'm home there yeah I actually left the
police please I left the police I left
the place perfectly tidy I went on like
a mad spree before like the only reason
I might guess that someone might have
been here and my only thing for it is
that I'm almost confident I put Frankie
Mary facing the door in case the
landlady came in and it was petrified
the shout out because all the doors are
closed this woman I'm pretty sure I
didn't do that but I don't know if that
well I have to check my vlog you know
when I left to decide that over than
that success just like that I've been
back in my
about 10 minutes and my groceries are
here so I'm just gonna go downstairs
collect them and myself for the night

offered I was like you don't have to
