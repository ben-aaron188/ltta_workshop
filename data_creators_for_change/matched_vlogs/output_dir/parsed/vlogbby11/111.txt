really still even though I like don't
feel well I still really really really
want to get a treat today because I was
supposed to film today and obviously I'm
not doing that anymore but I want to do
something and I feel like I really want
to get a tree because if by the time we
get it it's gonna go to be Christmas and
we're gonna take it down I would be so
sad I should be home super soon so maybe
we can go do that whoo update time it is
currently formal 8 p.m. and we are on
our way to go to get a Christmas tree

feel like if I just do nothing all day
that won't be really sad that I did
nothing all day so and I also feel like
if I don't get it today then we're not
gonna get it to like the weekend and
then it'll be a week past when we should
have gotten it I'm really hoping they
have one that we like cuz if they don't
know I'm gonna be sad there we go let's
hope we can find a Joey we just got here

just hope there's not only like one
option and we don't love it you know
another option is we could always just
walk it ourselves like people do that oh

something take pictures that one good
time let me so we're looking looking for
some options Ashley
