good morning guys what is up and welcome
to another loud this eyelash is
exceeding stunts and it's really
bothering me so today is our last full
day in New York I'm actually really sad
but I'm excited because I think we're
gonna have a real good day so it is
currently at 37 p.m. p.m. no lead-up
9:37 a.m. yeah anyways ash and I are
gonna go get some breakfast we are
really hungry snaps for Lita and Ashly
for getting ready early cuz that's a big
deal ok I need my jacket
apparently it's breathing out when you
wore something all day yesterday and
didn't realize there is a tag on it and
did another tag I love this jacket I got
at Urban out here that's another thing
like I kind of mention it in another
vlog but we really have to figure out
like we need to figure out how we're
gonna get our clothes up the good news
is I only came with one carry-on so I
could just bring another carry-on the
problem is is like jackets are so big so
they take up so much room so it's not
fair yeah that's true yeah ok let's get
back we got the keys we got the phone
bag let's go look at her get that ankle
I'm so hungry
so we are currently headed to breakfast
Joe is so hungry what do we want
low-key debating on like pancakes that
sounds so freakin good so low-key asked
to switch our table to come inside it
because it's a little more convenient I
kind of ordered a lot I got a slice of
avocado cones and some pancake feed out
I'm gonna eat her life don't judge me
oh my god this looks so good
I got way too much so we got some
avocado toast so we got some pancakes
Ashley got a breakfast sandwich and we
are about to eat all this so excited
yo that looks so good we got some coffee
definitely our next step after breakfast
for Christmas I'm literally so excited
to decorate like Ashlee literally just
said she's so excited decorate the house
for Christmas and I'm like say I think
next week I want to start oh we should
do everything we got some coffee so
excited I think we're just gonna like
walk around it's been such a good last
day already same time oh my god okay so
it's 308 p.m. currently been a bit less
my vlog and talk to you guys we had
breakfast I think the last thing I
really fogged we took a few pictures
that was fun both have some like a
random work to get done so I had to do
to vlog the one I'm soon put up a blog
hollow and then I've just been editing
some Instagram photos and stuff I'm the
type of person like I have to bulk edit
photos for my Instagram and when they're
fully at like I don't know so it's so
much easier for me to sit down at a
computer and like edit photos and then
have them ready to go so I can post them
daily you nobody knows anyone else like
that and the other youtubers like that
I've got my back I mean I guess I could
show you guys I guess I could show you
what I've been editing you know let me
let me show you maybe let's put up on
the screen that could low-key be a lot
so Ashley I went to Disneyland before we
came here
you guys saw that box I have all these
photos we designed I still haven't
posted yeah and I just edited them all
literally they're so cute oh okay
literally my phone was charged and
already like plugged into my computer it
might as well record the screen um so
yeah I've just been using PicMonkey I
mean you guys know I used to like it all
the freaking time okay I feel like I've
talked about it a lot you see how crisp
this photo is this whiten feature will
save your guys's live just have to draw
wherever you want it super white that's
how I keep my white feet I'm not even
kidding
make it so bright and bold
then just come here and fade it I always
use features that argument for the
feature you know what I mean but like
you can do anything that's what I love I
don't really use these effects too much
I usually just come here to adjust and
kind of do it all on my own like levels
like do you see this like you can make
something so bright actually am i
pregnant a little more blur blur feature
this is how you make every iPhone
picture look like you used an actual
camera like this because you just like
do the blur feature and it makes it look
like the aperture was like super wide
and like oh it looks beautiful
so yeah damnit PicMonkey link in the
description box I think my phone just
died like if I'm on my phone I really
want to edit like I'll still to use the
app a lot but for the most part I
usually like sitting and editing 10
photos at a time literally so many fan
pages like watermark their photos out
your permission or if they do steal your
photos without permission at least Alec
has your handles so if you guys do edits
of any kind like that would be so
helpful for you or for something else
like I always literally the Middle's
amazing so shout outs PicMonkey
link in the description box if you guys
are interested or if you're not
interested you probably just skipped all
this but why would you do that I'm
giving you all my secrets right now so
here's the outfit of the day up more
outfit of the night because it's kind of
like I feel like it's gonna be dark soon
I think this'll last I'm changing today

Topshop it's just like a cropped
long-sleeve shirt and then my pants are

beautiful view I'm really really really
excited guys my iphone screen is
literally frozen it's been frozen for 51
