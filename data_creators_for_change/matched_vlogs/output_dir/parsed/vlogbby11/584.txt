where to look I'm actually pretty good
but every now and then I'll like get off
my games and I'll be just like Murph I'm
looking there to me look there no
logging what I've never heard that but
I'm totally gonna use that going to the
face plate

so it's a chop shop and I got a shirt
like really great knitting class I tried
on so many things and nothing looks good
smirk and I hate trying things on to the
fact that I did well there's a lot just
so pretty out oh my gosh

pool and get some work done I really
want to finish editing yesterday's vlog
and get that up as soon as I can

so we're gonna do that I'm not sure what
else we're gonna do we just got mom to
chill and we both have stuff to do so
we're like let's go do it by the pool
because pool is cute boot shopping as
you saw I only got two things I just got
two tank tops from Topshop because they
were on sale they're normally $10 but it
was two for 18 so I saved $2 which is
awesome this one's like a neon yellow
color which I really like and this one
is just kind of like a muted blue mint
type of color many many many haul that's
the cool I showed you guys yesterday and
I think that there are that one weight
front 2 3 4 5 6
I think that we are such youtubers it
hurts currently editing by the pool hey
guys so it is so early Airport so it is
a 6 a.m. I want to say please don't mind
the fact that I look ridiculous right
now
I chose sleep over over putting my
makeup on
so this is the traveling outfit today
super comfy the choice you get honey
forever 21 shirt can we look at this out
it says no coffee depress oh and my
Nikes and we're just working on my fit
and I even decided that walden is
definitely coming with me on the plane
my plans are just to fall asleep for a
majority of the flight but yes that's
the we're leaving we're going back home
from the air
I am so fetus your battery's running
down
I know and you brought me to pull a and
I ate it and it was so good someone
tried to prank me and mixed wasabi like
a lot of was I hate wasabi into the
Glock and I keep it to her and I filmed
it and yes her reaction wasn't that
great you know what though like I'm
curious to see the footage where I'm
like this is spicy cuz like in my head I
was like I know I know I have been gone
everyone was like Alicia did you die
where's Ben although in reality I think
it's only been like five days since I
haven't uploaded a vlog but you know
well last you saw I was in New York and
I actually did have a little bit of
footage from like the next couple days
but honestly none of it went together
and then right when I came home I woke
up and I had like the worst cold I've
had in a long time currently how cough
drop my throat was just like like I
could hardly swallow it was horrible and
I never get sick I think the last time I
was sick was sometime last year at the
time before that was like the year
before like literally I feel I could get
sick sick no I feel like I usually get
sick once a year and I think it was just
all the traveling and I wasn't getting
much sleep and stuff so my body was just
like no I'm feeling a lot a lot better
from the past couple of days
that's why I wasn't vlogging honestly I
was just like I'm not feeling it and of
course being sick like I still like it
was just so much and then I was just
thinking about getting at this week's
video up on top of everything luckily I
was able to film some so here is my OTD
top is from victory secret for all let's
it's from Free People towards our Urban
Outfitters and I'm wearing it my fans
yay woo here we go through your filming
and vlogging at the same time ready ash
so I look cute when you're walking what
my one hand at least awkward so updates
here now a scarf I'm sorry
also you may have noticed the wardrobe
change here's a different sunglasses
this is one of the benefit
this is one of the perks of watching my
blog because you get like behind the
scenes the videos when you watch the
video it looks like it's two separate
days of what I filmed earlier at the
park and when I'm coming here at
Starbucks lot so it's the same day and I
just changed I thought it'd look better
if I was in two different outfits so
yeah that's what's going on right now so
we're filming and we yes I'm rambling
okay I'll be right back hey guys so
update is now a little bit later we're
gonna come here do that
hey guys so it is now a little bit later
help maybe not maybe not at all feeling
a little bit better if you're wondering
you probably still hear my voice just

been editing up until now I've actually
just been editing the intro and stuff

couch for probably the past week and my
tissues have been my best friend
