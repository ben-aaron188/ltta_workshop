morning guys so today is so weird so
today is a vlogmas day and nine which is
crazy to think about you like I say that
in every vlog I'm sorry but yeah anyways
this morning uh let's see it is about
it's almost 12 yeah again I was really
hoping to get up early like early no
definitely definitely did not happen
it's okay because I mean I'm reaching
the shower and I just uploaded it
yesterday's vlog it takes me so long to
edit vlogs it takes me like a good hour
they seem like they're really easy but
in reality like I don't know I try to be
quite a little more entertaining and
stuff so I purposely spend more time on
them and I know that you guys really
appreciate that so I just like making
everything the best that it can be for
you so it really does take a little bit
to do vlogs for me like I don't say like
a good hour but it's cool because by now
like it's been a week of doing these
like vlogmas vlog I'm kind of liking it
like I get up I have my coffee and my
breakfast then I edit my vlogs and then
I upload it and then I get ready for my
day and stuff it's kind of fun I guess I
could edit them at night I know a lot of
people do that but I don't know I feel
like the morning is just way better for
me but yes that's what's going on day
I'm planning on filming for most of the
day and then probably gym later I know
you guys really like seeing like behind
the scenes of filming and all that stuff
like the process of making a video you
