decorating it so there's always next
year of course we got our coffee I have
my merry and bright cup hey yay also it
is freezing outside so big surprise I'm
going to sit here and get some editing

edited this vlog like I rough cut it
already so I just have to do like a few
little things like the thumbnail and
whatnot but should be up pretty soon
which is exciting
you guys lock us up blah blah
welcome to the office that's a very
messy boom fogs up go watch it my
computer died otherwise I'd show you the
screen huh oops
so anyways Alisha is hungry so let's get
some breakfast
clock wow you look so small in this
whole frame right now you look so cute
let's put on some makeup done
it still looks hella messy but I totally
clean my vanity last night and I
actually clean my closet too which is
getting so wait I want to plug this in
cuz every time I've been doing my makeup
lately I've been sitting here realizing
ding I should have plugged that in boom
Christmas decor makes me so happy I'm
gonna be so sad but I have to take all
of it down I feel like the house finally
looks complete with it all oh hey this
is me just sitting here trying to see if
this angle is good for when I do my
makeup hopefully it looks good ok well
you know I put all my brushes hold on
one second
ok upbeat time so that I see my makeup I
really want to try out the new eyeshadow
palette that I got yesterday from Too
Faced is the gold chop chocolate gold
pal
I just I'm obsessed with this they're
all like super super super shimmery I'm
just I'm excited
also low-key um I this is how extra I am
I bolted in a tripod to my wall so you
guys can sit here all the time when I do
my makeup crazy or borderline genius I
want to put them everywhere like
throughout the house so I can just like
have certain angles that I use anyways
I'm gonna watch some YouTube videos
while I put on some makeup
and make it a stun except for my lips I
always I just never do my legs oh my god
this is a cute color let's do this I
think that's because honestly like I
usually do my makeup when I'm drinking
coffee so it just makes no sense

setup they like the makeup setup please
let me know be honest - it's ok but I'm
about to put tripods all over my house
