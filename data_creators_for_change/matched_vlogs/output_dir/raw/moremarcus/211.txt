279
00:13:56,999 --> 00:14:03,149
any advice for a new traveler whore um

280
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:06,429
keep keep your ways about you and if

281
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going somewhere that's like</font>

282
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:09,790
different so here's the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

283
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,309
you're in like Western Europe if you're

284
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,319
from Western Europe or even America like

285
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:16,059
all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> countries you go to and you're</font>

286
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:17,559
just like yeah this is like normal you

287
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:20,259
know but if you go further than those

288
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,529
countries and go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

289
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,910
continents and some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> places have</font>

290
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,049
completely different cultures and you

291
00:14:29,049 --> 00:14:31,299
should respect those cultures that's

292
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:33,220
what my advice would be because it's

293
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,019
weird like hearing to buy for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

294
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:40,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can beat this well I don't I don't</font>

295
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:42,100
come on this here and read the rules but

296
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,860
like you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really allowed to show</font>

297
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,989
public display of affection so like

298
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:49,600
holding hands or kissing and in like

299
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,459
some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> malls and stuff it's it's</font>

300
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:53,829
become very touristy that that's not

301
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:56,889
really like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> play if you walk down the</font>

302
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:59,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">street and stuff it's like they don't do</font>

303
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:03,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">that here so it's from coming from</font>

304
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,809
something we used to into this world

305
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:07,629
it's kinda like oh that's different and

306
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:09,309
it feels a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit weird but it's also like</font>

307
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,630
you're in their country so

308
