that'll make sense in a second hey
what's up you guys and now that I have
your attention okay I'm just gonna throw
this out there have you guys ever had
that pinch me punch me in the stomach
slap me in the face feeling immediately
I'm sure you're thinking woah woah woah
gonner calm down with violence can I
respond Thissen don't tell me what to do
ever Hey knives are fun yes so back to
that feeling I got that feeling that I
was trying to describe the other day at
my mom's birthday dinner me my family
route to you this nice restaurant and I
had this delicious like I'm talking the
best food you ever had it was lobster
linguine by the way yes I was in no way
expecting this food to be the best thing
I've ever eaten but when it was I was
just like oh my god this food is so
freakin good
like unimaginably good like so
unimaginable that I thought I was
dreaming and I want someone to slap me
so I make any sense I don't really know
but basically it just gave me that
feeling and I had to think of what are
some other things that I've done or that
I can do they give me that feeling and
here's what I came up with when you wake
up in the morning what seems like
minutes before your alarm is about to go
off you look at it and oh my god it's
still got a couple hours left
oh my god
just great it's just the best thing ever
when you're driving a vehicle if you
have a license and you happen to hit all
of the green lights all of them all of
the green lights the ones you just get
to keep going you don't have to stop
it's amazing ah okay here we go singing
it show oh I hit one oh I hit 203 oh my
gosh it when you're on the Twitter and
you happen to notice that someone that
you like a lot someone that you are
crushing on favorites your freaking
tweet this is real life this is
happening so bored I know I'm gonna
check my crushes favorites on Twitter oh
yes oh my god
I gotta tell someone when you order
something and you're waiting for it to
come in the mail and oh my god it came
early
it's can't okay that sounds really dirty
but I'm thinking about it oops
oh this is the mail Mail's here
go I wonder if my package came let's see
what side oh my god
I begin my you wanna fuck you baby
oh when you pull a shirt fresh out of
the dryer and immediately put it on I'm
just covered in a blanket of loveliness
it just make me feel so warm and cuddly
needs a cuddle buddy when you have a
nice warm t-shirt okay actually take the
cuddle buddy I'm so alone
I'm so excited and finally when you come
home from a long long day and you're
just expecting to eat leftovers just to
hear that your mom or dad or roommate or
that annoying neighbor girl that won't
leave you the fuck alone ordered you
pizza but yeah so those are some of the
times that I get that feeling aren't
