argument a little bit of a tussle I bet

I'm sure all of you have been in some
sort of argument where you're bickering
back and forth with a person and it
comes to the point where you don't have
a comeback you look kind of stupid but

late but you know I can talk about
comebacks for hours so instead of
talking I'm just gonna show you roll
