hey what's up you guys so for this
week's video I really didn't know what
to do like I had a list I had a bunch
ideas but I didn't feel that strong
about one so I decided to ask you guys
and you really wanted me to do another
ask Connor but I want to add a little
bit of a twist to it so I had you guys
submit questions only about
relationships love sex boys girls all
that kinds of stuff but yeah so let's
get right into it how do you get over a
crush hey this is actually kind of a
difficult question I'm gonna say food
lots of food or just find another person
there's plenty of them in a relationship
do you like to be the one that's
laughing or the one that makes the other
person laugh okay so in the past I used
to always be the one that's just like I
love to make people laugh I want to be
the funny one but of course I like to
laugh too so I need to be in
relationship with someone that is funny
so I'm kind of torn but I'm just gonna
say somewhere in the middle we need to
equally be as funny okay here that says
an equal partnership make me laugh oh
you guys actually get annoyed if you
text them a lot one of the most
difficult things and texting somebody
that you like is where do you draw the
line right here their dad is great yeah
yeah but really for someone that you
like you do not want to send them too
many text messages because you could
come out way too strong if the feelings
are mutual they will text you back too
so just hold in there just how old in
there how do you ask for news you know
this couldn't just be a normal video we
had to talk about naked people
personally I like the approach of just
saying hey I like you with clothes on
but I liked you better with them off
send me your nudes do you have a long
tongue first of all I'm just realizing
how weird the word tongue looks let me
just look at it fuck do you support
same-sex marriage I won high percent two
equal rights love is love
all that jazz our relationships better
with Nutella everything is better with
Nutella don't forget it how many times
have you been in a relationship me this
question is to me I have been in three
relationships in my entire life not many
you guys are really good at bringing up
bad memories watch Connor
how can you flirt with someone in
Spanish class
oh come on stats megusta soukara
yeah yeah you ever wish you were in a
relationship this is actually difficult
I do sometimes but other times I'm
really happy to be single I haven't
found a person since my last
relationship that I thought I would want
to be in a relationship with so yeah I'm
okay with being single for now until I
find the right person do you believe in
love at first sight
hmm I'm gonna say no and the reason I
say that is because I feel like you
cannot be in love with a person just by
looking at them so you can be in love
with how they look but that's not all
there is to a person not everything is
based upon looks it's about the inside
I'm not gonna fall over again because I
already done that like three times in
this video but when you see an
attractive person holy shit you feel it
oh god you feel it in your soul do you
believe in soulmates oh god another hard
question I do but I believe that you
could have more than one soul mate out
there so yes you can find one person
love that person and be happy together
forever but there are seven billion
people in the world so there could be
another one out there mmm let's get
battery questions oh god I call do you
like romantic books or films yeah to be
honest I am a big fan of both so if the
waterworks go and I'm gonna cry hey this
is beautiful what do you think girls do
at sleepovers with this video but you
know I'm gonna put it in here anyway I
imagine girls sleepovers go something
like this
here's a simple question how do you get
into a relationship like this huh I'm in
a relationship
buy one on the internet let's be real
here and finally how can you tell
someone likes you you can tell if a
person likes you by the following if
they call you on all your social medias
if they favorite your tweets if they
like your photos a lot and if they send
you news okay bye or you know if they
just like tell you but that's too simple
now isn't it okay so I hope you guys
enjoyed this little Q&A I hope I taught
you a little bit about love sex
relationships girls boys all that stuff
and maybe even sleepovers I don't know
