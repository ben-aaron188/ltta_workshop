hmm hey what's up you guys it's Connor
once again a new setting but we'll get
to that a little bit later in the video
ok so this week I wanted to do a little
bit of a story time and not a story
about just one particular thing but a
story about like the past month so the
month of August has been literally
insane for me and I just have to tell
you guys everything about it it's been
so weird and crazy because I've not been
in the same state for like more than a
week but as crazy as it is I actually
love it and I've had so much fun this
month so let's start off with teen who I
went to tea and who'd back at the end of
July and it was so cool were tons of
screaming girls tons of scream boys and
a lot of screaming moms as well come on
love me it was so much fun me and the
other boys of our secondly I've got two
hosts and it was just overall a great
experience and a week after that I was
in Anaheim California for VidCon this
was my second time at VidCon but oh my
god it was so insane the first time I
went to VidCon last year I had like
maybe 30,000 subscribers and then this
year I went and I had like 700,000 or
something and it just it blew my mind
one it blows my mind that I have that
many subscribers - it blows my mind that
I got that many in a year and three just
seeing it is insane it was honestly so
great to meet you guys it was so much
fun and I loved hugging and taking
pictures and doing whatever you guys
wanted to do sounds kind of bad but
kinda the truth I had lots of meetups
lots of signings bunch of stage things
and I also got to go to a bunch of cool
sexy little YouTube parties lots of fun
talking and hanging out with everyone it
was pretty much one big orgy of nerds
what can I say
moving on the weekend after that I went
to Hawaii with my family so I went with
my two parents would you saw in last
week's video my older brother his
girlfriend my younger brother my sister
and my sister's boyfriend so it was a
lot of people but it was so much fun we
went snorkeling we went to beaches we
saw dolphins we swam with sea turtles it
was just it was amazing and then after
that we could relaxing I went back home
to Minnesota like literally what is my
life I've been in pretty much every
state this month except that was me more
chill all I had to do is just relax and
like go on tumblr and stuff which by the
way freaking sidenote never go on tumblr
when you're in public or around your
family just oh just Jesus Christ don't
do it when I go on tumblr I type in the
word cool and naked people are popping
up left and right so much porn so much
porn but besides that I just got to hang
out with my old friends play
my cats everything between just it's
just so much fun it's how much fun like
for everything I've done
so much fun okay and since I've been
flying a lot of places I need to
transition to the plane rides I've
obviously taken planes to everywhere
I've been and I would have been so bored
if it weren't for audible audible is a
website where you can download
audiobooks so I just downloaded them and
put them on my iPad and the one that I'm
currently reading is The Fault in Our
Stars by John Green a fellow youtuber
it's such a great mixture between
hilarious and sad I've never read a book
that's this inappropriately funny
considering it's about a girl who has
cancer who falls in love with a boy
who's an amputee I highly recommend it
