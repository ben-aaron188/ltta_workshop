and wait wait hey what's up you guys
it's Connor and I bet based on the
thumbnail and the title you can already
see that this week I want to talk about
sex and no I want to be totally legit
here I think this is something you guys
all need because holy shit quoting my
girl Raven you're all a bunch of little
nasties little nasties seriously I get
so many Twitter Tumblr and Facebook
comments about sex it actually kind of
creeps me out
they're all like have my babies Connor
well you have sex with me I want to have
sex with you be the father of my
children and sometimes they're even just
straight-up me just me oh my god cuz
wrong with you
you're saying this to a person you have
never met I don't even know I literally
picture some of these people being at
the computers all like first of all I'm
a 20 year old guy and I'm pretty sure a
lot of these comments come from 12 year
old girls creepy yeah I know right it
makes me feel like a pedophile and I kid
you not when I say some of these
comments actually scare me I'm a grown
man and one of my biggest concerns is
being sexually assaulted by an army of
12 year old girls there's something
wrong with that like honestly I feel
like some of the people don't even think
I actually see the messages but oh yes I
do
so being creepy but okay Real Talk
here's the deal with sex just to let you
know right off the bat everyone thinks
about it in fact most guys and girls
think about it several times a day I
totally didn't just google that there's
some people that take it further than
just thinking about it to themselves and
actually talking about it to people like
this happens a lot I'll be on lunch with
someone I barely know and notice start
talking about it it's up Connor it's up
so uh was with Sara last night oh boy
cool and we had sex I just met this kid
two days ago a wot
my mac and cheese doesn't look so good
anymore like everywhere put the table
and I just flip the table and run yeah
yeah it gets pretty awkward at times
just some things I don't need to know
some things just need to be kept to
yourself but on a lighter note sex is
something personal if and when you do it
be safe and make it special or just be a
total whore and sleep with everything
that walks that's what most people do I
mean really why not just get naked for
the end of this video was about sex
right it's pretty relevant we're all a
bunch of sluts and whores
but ok so I hope you guys enjoyed this
week's video if you did make sure to
give it a big thumbs up and comment
below some questions you have about sex
I probably won't answer them because
they're probably gonna be really awkward
but you know maybe I will who knows who
knows you never know what kind of mood
I'm gonna be in make sure to follow me
on Instagram Twitter Tumblr like my
Facebook page and subscribe to my main
channel and my second channel for more
videos not put them out every week but
