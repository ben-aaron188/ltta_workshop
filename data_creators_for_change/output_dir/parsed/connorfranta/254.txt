hey what's up you guys it's Connor jazz
hands okay so obviously I'm a guy
shocker and you could say I know a few
things about girls or at least I like to
think I know a lot of things about girls
maybe I don't
maybe I'm completely wrong mmm but I
think there are a lot of things girls
don't know about guys some things you
never think about some things you just
wonder all the time so that's why I made
a list of things girls wonder about guys
but okay let's just get right into it
okay so guys don't get the subtle hints
like as a girl do you make hints to us
that you want something or want to do
something I want to go somewhere we
probably won't catch on it's honestly
best to just straight-up tell us what
you want you know make it much easier
it'll take less time it'll just be
overall better it's pretty unfortunate
that we don't catch on right away but
his life another thing is guys zone out
and it's not necessarily because we
don't care what you're talking about
it's just it just happens I swear I'd
say a good 70 percent of my time I just
I'm zoning out and I don't know what I'm
doing off in my own little world welcome
to Wonderland population you how did I
get here where am I another thing is
guys cry wait what but they're guys
they're men muscles and stuff yeah as
much as we don't like to admit it we cry
sometimes and there's nothing wrong with
that next if you ever find yourself in a
situation we don't know what to talk
about with a guy just gossip I'm gonna
be straight-up honest right here guys
love to gossip so if you have no idea
what to talk about but you have a mutual
friend just talk about that person it's
all in good fun it's all in good fun no
but really like any time I'm with a
group of guys we tend to get on the
topic of gossip gossip such a weird word
for it but yeah we talk about people
here's a quick general rule for girls
whether you're with your boyfriend or
just a random guy friend please please
do not talk about your ex boyfriends
it's awkward we really don't care just
don't bring it up it's dead done get
over it okay move on no which brings me
into my next point instead how about you
focus on being a little quirky and funny
guys love a girl they can laugh with or
a girl they can laugh at in the best way
possible truly funny girls are really
attractive but sometimes they're really
hard to come by just be yourself be
quirky be funny it's okay we love it and
just so you know if a guy kisses you it
means he likes you take it as a
compliment me personally I love to tease
all my friends that are girls because I
know they won't take it wrong and it's
just so fun there's just honestly don't
mind
no I don't even know poke moving on a
lot of girls are worried about their
weights and based on the conversations I
have with a lot of my friends we like
girls that are regular we don't want a
girl that looks like this but we also
don't want a girl that looks like this
yeah so if you exercise regularly and
you know eat healthy watch what you eat
you're fine but personally I love when I
go out to eat with a girl and she buys
like pizza or a hamburger or something I
don't know what it is about it's just so
much cooler so don't worry about that
since we're on the topic of food guys
love food it's not really an unknown
topic so if you like a guy bring them
food making food just do something with
food we love food and most the time it's
not us trying to be mean if we ask you
to make a sandwich because we probably
really like your sandwiches sandwiches
love food okay just love food and
finally guys don't mind if girls don't
dress up everyday it's okay to wear
sweatpants sometimes and just you know
not look your best but then again don't
not dress up ever because then you just
kind of look sloppy and ratchet but
really that's it help my fellow guys can
agree with this list and I hope it helps
out some of you girls okay so I hope you
