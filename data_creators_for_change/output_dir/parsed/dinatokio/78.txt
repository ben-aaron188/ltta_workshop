dressed do you wanna see my clothes make
sure you follow me on Twitter on buttons
apps and you get all my outfit details
like daily there because it's so easy to
use barefaced again but don't worry I'm
starting to really enjoy literally way
any makeup or if I am wearing makeup oh
my god Hannah careful
I will let you just do brows and mascara
I haven't done before today but we think
about going out eat breakfast and then
just taking home to the park cause it's
a chill Sunday and then later on tonight
I think I'm going to get a bunch of
editing done because tomorrow one day I
have a big project to work on my country
on although which means being offline
for the majority of the day hi guys it
is Monday afternoon and basically I was
such a super market either I said not to
because he said my awful exams I was
like well get lost and I change back my
PJs and carried on working on wherever
the hell I was working off now just come
back and he's making mac and cheese dog
she's like you know I'll make it better
if you go and you get ingredients for
mac and cheese and you buy blue blue
some clubs yeah so he's got he's got
real true
yeah gave him an hour to do it so he's
got ingredients for mac and cheese I've
been asking to make my cheese for weeks
it's not these days and this is why you
bought for Hannah and it's all from
Tesco or Asda Cheska so this pack of
t-shirts but she's already got by the
way but he picked it up anyway because

all guys by the way also this morning I
phoned up and booked myself in for a
hair appointment at color nation London
which is a hairdressers just off Oxford
Street and basically they've got a
women's only room at the back where they
do like you know hey jebby here or just
any woman who wants a bit more privacy
for ages since I've been baby wearing
Hannah especially since she was younger
because we haven't actually carried over
sling for a while now she's quite big
I've always thought why can't they just
make a sling way it's like a rucksack
no stupid waist fastenings no nothing
literally like a rucksack and you put a
baby in there and you're comfortable and
it's done it's easy it doesn't ruin your
outfit on an AK right
so I'll googling and there is something
like that it's called on Boheme oh look
literally a rucksack so they're just two
straps the baby goes in the sling on the
back so it goes into like a seat babies
in it on the back two straps on the news
have a chest strap just like you would
do the rock side I tried Halloween about
three or four times the first two times
she was like get me out of here and the
third or fourth time we're just
strolling around the garden and she was
she was okay from a brand called skull
it's an Indian brand India's biggest
baby wearing brand so this is what it
looks like they go
if only Hana just gets comfortable with
it and then I'll be chilling for when we
go travelling update update is that
