good morning guys
it is 9:30 maybe some of that and we are
leaving the Dominican treehouse village
today unfortunately and we are all
heading off to different places as you
can tell it's just woken up I managed to
get a coffee but always takes me a few
hours in the morning nothing like a nice
little jungle trek
guys we've just been flagged down by the
dominican police I guess for speeding a
little bit probably have to pay a fine
hola don't speaking Spanish sorry yeah
sure turns out I was doing 104 in in an
80 this is a national park so they want
to keep the speed slow for animals and
stuff I think I need to wrap my head
even though I driver in other countries
a lot like around kilometers and miles
like I don't ever convert them when I
look at Columbus now I'm like I don't
know like you know 80 is slow though
that is really slow that's like 50 those
cars Oh
oh come on I'll get guys we we basically
just had to pay a bribe to the police
they said there's two options we have to
go to court and pay the full fine or we
could pay them there and then he just
let me up then he let us off like a
thousand pesos oh yeah so we paid notice
okay mm but originally was going to be
like three thousand or something
anyway it was very nice of them they
seem friendly they took a selfie with us
I like it when I meet like nice
policemen you know I annoyed we're gonna
try and find a waterfall down how far
was the waterfall
it's another 15 minutes I think we
pulled over this is the place we're
going to check out do we know how long
the track it marked the walkers
this is an unexpected last-minute
adventure before we fly I think we
allowed just enough time to you know
spend like a half an hour or something
here
this looks like quite a cool local spot
two guys have just shown up the little
boom box playing salsa I think I think I
could spend a few hours here it looks
like the waters probably warm enough to
swim in as well look at this guy just
chillin absolute relaxin to the max
jungle waterfalls never get old from it
does anyone know any destinations which
have the waterfalls with a swings where
you can like swing and like you know
backflip into the pool I've never done
that I'd like to do that but actually
maybe I've done that in Brazil before
being on a swing by waterfall the
rental-car guy finally dropped us off at
the gate I'm heading in now drawings off
first when's your flight okay so got
like an hour and a half and then me and
David are gonna be waiting around for a
little while Ola with free security it's
quite long and through security joram
had to literally run that for his flight
we don't even know if he made it yet but
me and David have had a chance to sit
down and grab a last meal together and
David's like did start boarding ten
minutes ago - just started boarding but
I think if we eat quickly we're not
gonna have problems
sir speed in a nice last day isn't it
yeah it's been good yeah it's good that
we actually got to do some stuff
I'm hoping this is as good as it looks
this is a the only thing on the menu
that looks suitable for me
ooh we're going around
okay
landed in Miami I have I think 20
minutes to winx flight boards it's been
quite long getting through security I've
cleared customs into the u.s. now and
now I need to find my connecting flight
yeah it's quite tight it's quite tight I
managed to get some food before getting
on the next flight American Airlines I
guess I don't know this is all their
flights but they don't do they don't
serve meals you can buy like little
packets of chips and hummus and stuff
but I needed something a bit more
substantial so I'm just to get a vegan
forget how much a vegetable forget this
is my thing this is my guy so I've just
been doing some editing at the gate and
funny story I still have my phone set to
Dominican time so I thought I was like
rushing to catch this fly it turns out I
was an hour early and Rio is chatting -
music is light wait what time is it
there no anyway
I was mistaken and then we realized it's
much better this way around though I was
now early then it's if my phone was set
an hour the rock the other way then I
would have just been like chilling
walking to the fly and could have missed
it just landed in LAX
sorry productive flight managed to get a
vlog edited radar not vlogging flights
are that can't really see out the window
literally I've blogged my feet but it's
not a lot yeah there's not a lot going
on I'm really excited to see Riya when
you're jumping over now and I'm gonna
order an uber each to meet me at the
hotel this is my guy
all right I've arrived
I think this is my pad I'm glad to be
back in the states it's gonna be a
really nice chilled week CashNet leg

food in me and getting really good
