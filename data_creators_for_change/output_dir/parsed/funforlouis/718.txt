is
great thing about New York in Brooklyn
this view this takes like 30 seconds
he's literally open you're out boom I'm
not being paid by able to pay that I
love you but I know this controversial
are they some people don't like it but
it's the most convenient they and they
provide jobs to people
I always think Brooklyn is closest
jackée and it is but it's tilted like an
hour in the Hoover to get that oh my
gosh security and again because we do
have to clean up everything and have a
seat
we've got about 45 minutes left in the
flight but so prefer to prepare for
landing
please close your tray table and put
away carry-on item
but like like a king
gosh that lightning words in the same I
don't know you could quite wrong how
nuts it was but I've never landed in a
lightning storm before there's literally
lightning bolts going off every like two
seconds I think I'll call quite loving
hammer we couldn't hear the Thunder
that's the craziest thing and yeah
everyone was just quiet I was like I
know what happened to the plane get
struck by lightning you guys know so
anyway I've landed in Phoenix Arizona
and I haven't even told you guys why I'm
here yet basically I've been invited to
this like prestigious event at Google
run it's called Google zeitgeist and
I've just pulled up a little thing that
talks about it
it says Google zeitgeist events are a
series of intimate gatherings of top
global thinkers and leaders explore the
ideas that affect us social economic
political and cultural surroundings hear
perspectives from industry pioneers and
States people renowned writers bloggers
scientists artists activists and
musicians learn from progressive minds
and discuss topics that influence the
world around us that is pretty awesome
and I've been invited along to
specifically showcase some of the 360
video stuff I've been doing is it's kind
of like pioneering in that space and I'm
sure that we other like VR things there
and so now I'm pretty excited I don't
really know what to expect
I think I'm supposed to be going
straight from the airport to an event I
don't even know I'm supposed out a suit
I just landed at Phoenix Airport and

emails and a you the person I should be
like kind of reaching out to you just to

jump into alright guys I'll come true to
the sandbox area where they're
showcasing the 360 video look at this
setup there's five projectors and
there's like the cylindrical room and
they projected my Romania 360 video

in each of us there is a need to dream
explore and build but what does it take
to create the next idea industry or even
a movement that will drive us
collectively forward as I close 2015

today the visionaries of tomorrow to
discuss what is needed to make the next
giant leap in terrific this is a
software powering the whole thing it's

here early though I've told me it's
still I get seven but they look again at
8 a.m. which is really early but it's
going to be worth it and there's gonna
be some very interesting people hanging
around which becomes of me good
networking opportunity I think
