and we've just seen the boys they've
actually climbed all the way up this
ledge here so we're going to try and get
to them we made it to the top of the
rocks join these guys but ever walk so
worth it for the view though this is
awesome I'm so glad has actually got
today to explore this part see some
incredible scenery
but for the RV this is pretty epic out
here guys I have no idea how these rock
formations are formed is it just like
it's just like desert and then wash just
like massive rocks stickin up vertically
and then back to desert crazy

breakfast but as we were leaving the
park dumb insisted he wanted to go on a
hike so Dom got out the RV and walked
off in the middle of the desert and for
some reason we just left him realize ok
