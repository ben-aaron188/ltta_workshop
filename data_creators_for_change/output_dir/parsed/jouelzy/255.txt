smart brown girl thursday shop that
smart brown girl dot-com support the
smart brown girl movement we also have a
pre-sale of sorority colored smart brown
girl sweatshirts only its pre-sale only
once the pre-sales over that's a wrap
for them alright let's get into this
because my whole life was changed on
Monday night finally got myself together
hop in the cab and so behind the movie
theater and went to go see some girl if
you follow me on snapchat or an
Instagram I was all laid out so this
smart brown girl is dedicated to give me
my second smart brown girl movie review
for the ava duvernay 's selma i'm on the
movie don't move me so much I don't even
looked up how to correctly pronounce ava
duvernay last name let's plate it again
okay
two very night we got that right because
it was she slayed all hope sweetest a
mispronouncing people's name so I want
to show you respect
it's a home girl because girl for
whatever reason when black movies come
out there seems to be this like train of
thought when a movie talks about the
history of black Americans that people
would all want to go see it because oh
my gosh too many emotions or why can't
we just be happy or like it's it's just
like looks let's just understand the
mechanics that happen in Hollywood and
that for all your cockamamie reasons for
not one to go see Selma it is very hard
to get anything beyond the Tyler Perry
film produced in Hollywood the movie is
so daggone bomb that african-american
business leaders have come together to
create a fun to allow students inmate in
particular cities the opportunity go see
someone for free
like my eight-year-old self I would take
to see Selma I was the kid you had to
hide the newspaper from if you if you
could take your child to go see the
Mockingjay
during installation of hunger games then
your child can go see Selma the magic
that Duvernay just blessed us all with
and I'm gonna add some notes girl cuz it
was - theory and stuff first of all
don't wear too much makeup a big old
pair of sunglasses because you will shed
tears I'm an emo Doug I'd be crying in
the dark mr. movie theater a particular
scene within like the first 15 years and
movie in a and I know I know what it was
cuz I counted I counted it was a church
and I went one two three I counted it is
historical so I already knew what was
fittin to happen and it's still and
still quite mean I was it's still got me
and I was watching the interview where
Ava Duvernay who you have she's just
she's magnificent he was saying how
could shut out - the director of
photography Bradford young Bradford
young my man you did your thing but she
was saying in them how they purposely
edited the movie because they kind of
they want you to realize the gravity of
what was happening so they slowed
certain things down it was like it was
like pow in slow motion because you need
to understand that the humanistic depth
of what was happening and how real this
was supposed to really move you inside
and for a movie Selma past a lot of
historical context into it was like two
and a half hours Ava Duvernay was not I
won't keep saying her name because I
pronounce it now Ava Duvernay in an
interview said that she was not able to
get the licensing to Martin Luther King
speeches you know all of Kings speeches
are copyrighted it'll they didn't have
the ease of just having these already
crafted magnificence we just use they
had to rewrite and come up with their
own speeches that still captured the
essence of the power of Martin Luther
King as a-- or Eva and her crew have
gotten some heat about how they portray
lyndon b johnson in the movie in that he
doesn't come across as like a true-blue
supporter of the demands that Martin
Luther King is making about the civil
rights movement and I think that's way
more accurate than this kind of whole
idea of this white
Savior that's so often presented about
white men who did push through less
legislation for the civil rights
movement I mean if you go back let's
just pause here because if you go back
you can listen to James Baldwin on
camera being interviewed about the time
that him Harry Belafonte Lorraine
Hansberry and a few other people up in
Harlem had robbed
Robert F Kennedy come through and sit
down and he thinking because he is a
herald of the black man at the time and
politics that they often agree him with
happy faces and Cheerios and James
Baldwin was like we stacked homeboy Dale
and it tells him straight like what
you're doing is not enough you don't
understand your privilege is proceeding
you here and you don't really understand
the plight of the black man or the black
woman in America so let us let us break
it down to you how this is ain't--we
ain't nowhere near the cherry being put
on top of the civil rights movement
right now it's very realistic that as
the president and what that means to be
the president that Lyndon Johnson did
push back on certain things and that he
was playing to his own political benefit
and he wasn't really just a champion of
his civil rights because he so believed
in the rights of the black man I think
you know you kind of have like the
political spectrum at that time what was
going on and you know I know the movie
didn't even allude to how much the
Vietnam War and what was going on with
that impacted the civil rights movement
and how kind of crazy it is you know I
don't think the representation of him in
the movie was inaccurate by any stretch
of the imagination so what I appreciate
it was the showing of women and I think
this is what gets left out of the
conversation so much of civil rights
it's how much women play the role
especially to the powers of Coretta
Scott King who I think I mean I think we
kind of look back on everything with
rose-colored glasses and we want
everything to just you know look back at
it as if it was all prim and proper and
you know a white flag was raised and we
won the war and that's not really how it
happened you know I think sometimes
Coretta Scott
Kings o Hamas's played down in history
in that you know they did touch on
Martin Luther King's infidelity and so
you know rather than portraying her as
someone who didn't know or is it not
causing any problem or is it not being a
burden that she took on you know I feel
like they really kind of showed the
strength of what it meant for Coretta
Scott King to be the wife of Martin
Luther King and the mother of his
children and how she did impact the
civil rights movement you know oh my
gosh well Malcolm X shut up in the movie
house yo they casted this movie so well
and they touched on everything like I
like this was real I like this
wasn't no I'm the civil rights movement
was everybody agree and everybody rose
up and everybody was in comeuppance with
each other no they was really they
really talked about how they play people
against each other and when Malcolm X
show up my dual that was good that was
that was the whole exchange between
Malcolm X accredits got King I was in
their life no I'm aware of the world
around me and I'm aware of how the
landscape of America is changing and how
what it means to be black in America is
ever-evolving and ever expanding and I
think so often kind of you know there's
been a downplay about the culture of
what what it means to be a black
American or an african-american or how
you ever however you want to
self-identify and I feel like for me
this movie kinda just show like how much
weight our community and culture does
really carry like this is part of my own
fabric I just walked out of that movie
just with so much pride but so much
understanding of how much work we really
have to do this is my favorite
my favorite scene was when Martin Luther
King after having a row ruff-ruff-ruff
night he got up and called Mahalia
Jackson some wee hours of the night
play by lettuce teeth but that's when I
knew the casting was on point we let us
see rolled up out the bed and singer
Mahalia Jackson all he said to her was
mahalia I need to hear the voice of guy
right now let me tell you my favorite
song my favorite song when I am down and
out from the black brown and beige Duke
Ellington album it has come Sunday with
Mahalia Jackson like I'm sorry to keep
having to bring up who should know I got
I got my sternum smashed on by a young
man out here and he was still in my
house I will I put on come Sunday but
coz identity in that moment I needed to
hear the voice of God and literally when
lettuce II got up and sang as Mahalia
Jackson give it a moment and you know
they kind of talk about the division
between the younger college-age students
who felt like they had mobilized and
King which is coming in with the camera
to take all their glory away Wendell
Pierce play Hosea Williams who we should
all know courtesy of real houses of
Atlanta because his granddaughter is
Porsha now really Hosea Williams real
legacy is obviously you know program is
still runs in Atlanta today was a
significant player in the civil rights
movement you know he had his motto was
unbought and unbossed
which you know in my shady behind the
whole time in a movie at the end when
they kind of do run buys of where each
person ends up I was waiting for them to
get to Hosea and be like he went on to
be a civil rights leader through his
unbought and unbossed campaign but his
granddaughter Porsha was bought for
fourteen ounces of weave and his dumb
ass doorknobs that's what I waited for
the whole time not shade mache go see it
like it I think for a lot of people it's
a great introductory
to American history I think it should
provoke you to look up more about
American history what the civil rights
movement really was at that time and how
we can learn from it and how we can take
from it in 2015 and let me know in the
comments if you've seen someone what was
your reaction and please just don't you
know even if you didn't particularly
care for it like let me know in depth
tell me what it is I'm eight maybe I can
get Ava Duvernay to do smart Brown girl
in maybe that'll be one of my 3130 goals
I just absolutely positively loved every
bit of this movie good kid maad city is
an epic album loved it
still play it you should just rap more
and talk less and read a few books
