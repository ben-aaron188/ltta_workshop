downer and that's not what I want at
Christmas I mean there's like feasts and
there's opening presents and there's
stockings and all the tropes are there
you eat spaghetti with maple syrup and
cotton ball whose idea was it to bring a
tree inside and then decorate it Oh
Germans yeah yeah around that area
Germany didn't exist right but like the
Germanic I think the idea was it's the
middle of winter and we're depressed so
we need some green up in here
Springs a long time away I was reading
that they would hang trees from the
ceiling right well you know the house is
small so you probably couldn't really
have a lot of floor space too right
before they had the trees and also
people who couldn't afford a full tree
would just have like pine boughs love
affair with a monado's to have been
Christmas we were talking about it now
which means Katherine's going to cry for
a while I'll be back in a little bit the
thing that I have a problem with
Christmas is that it's comes as done
it's over bye-bye oh yeah and you're
like yeah we did though we were prepped
for so long I got all this stuff in my
house no I leave it up for Christmas and
much most of January when you can blow
on the tree and the needles fall off oh
