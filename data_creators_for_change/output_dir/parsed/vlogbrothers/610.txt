good morning Hank it's Tuesday hi
everyone else I'm Rosie Anna I'm John's
assistant i'm also John and Hank secret
London's sister as of way back when to
Hank when people find out that I'm drugs
assistant especially because I live so
far away in London the number one
question they ask is so what is it that
you do today I'm going to endeavor to
answer this question but first I want to
give a little bit of an office tour
because we've seen your office in
Missoula Hank we've also seen John's it
office energy mouth lift that's a really
hard phrase to say office in
Indianapolis so without further ado this
is my office this is my view these are
the wild animals I can see from my
office this is the foliage I can see
from my office and these are the trees
so it's for the job itself a large part
my role is scheduling which is lucky
because I am awesome at it through the
combined wonder of Craigslist shared
calendars on Gmail and Skype credit I'm
able to coordinate someone to come in
and organize John's Pizza John shirts by
Heat's very important that they're in
rainbow order god I love rainbows I see
it someone to come in and sit in John's
car seat to warm it up burn for about 15
minutes every time before he wants to
take the car out I would say it's been
about half my time here in the London
office and I commute about three days a
week to Indianapolis hardest part about
this is probably the I don't know say
eight hours or so that I'm over the
Atlantic Ocean without any internet is
particularly difficult for doing my job
especially because John often calls me
quite casually throughout the day to do
things like look up words in the
dictionary for him not necessarily for
his next book just to complete the
crossword he says it's not cheating if
he asks me
on the upside my air miles are awesome
and the crew at Virgin Atlantic really
know how to make an amazing gin and
tonic another key part of my role is
security testing I feel like I'm kind of
a pro at this because I've seen every
episode of homeland at least six times
I also remember everything that Nancy
McNally well that just fell down has
ever said okay well now that's yeah well
done right in them so just like the NSA
I do spend a lot of my time hacking into
John's personal accounts online just to
double-check all the security levels and
then I also change all the passwords
every like three hours when John takes
us to dftba con 4 I changed that to
change the passwords every 15 minutes
just to be super safe but otherwise my
sister ship is pretty normal standard
stuff the role like washing and
blow-drying John's used tissues and so
that he can reuse them in the name of
sustainability and also ghostwriting
found metal from John to Steve and Jared
and by fan mail I mean
love letters out of all my roles this is
the hardest for me because I am a
die-hard West Ham United fan I have been
known to slip a few references to
bubbles into these love letters I will
admit that Steven Jarrod is a very
talented player for Liverpool Football
Club and even a little bit handsome but
I do always feel like I'm betraying my
beloved irons but I suppose they gave us
carrot also there you go some of the
recent projects I've undertaken in my
spare time include building up Henry and
Alice's library for the next 15 to 18
years taking them from the joint British
burned right up to the Unbearable
Lightness of being another thing I'm
doing is overseeing the construction of
an exact replica of the Globe Theatre
and in John's back garden mainly so his
kids can see Shakespeare as everyone was
supposed to see Shakespeare standing up
other priorities include building up
John's Lauren Conrad gift collection
with a smidge of Benedict Cumberbatch
and the adolescent wolf program just to
keep everyone happy it's okay jokes
aside it's honestly the best job I've
ever had it's really cool getting to
work with you guys it's really been
honest thinking and looking back at me
in 2006 I used to read John's blog his
very static blog and 2007 me who was
addicted to positive window because the
tools I use now without even thinking
about it to do my job just weren't
really possible then go pout and shared
calendars on start emails that tell me
that it's time for John to put more air
in his tires which he spells with an eye
which is weird so basically what I'm
saying Hank is that we're living in the
future and I'm loving it thanks for
being awesome everyone and Hank I will
see you on Friday
bye
