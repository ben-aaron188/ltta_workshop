1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,480
Ughhhhh

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,360
Good morning Hank, it's Tuesday.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,720
I had all kinds of plans for today's video but instead it's going to be about tiny chickens

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,540
because I've been invaded.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,260
Ughhhhhh

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,060
Quick sidenote for nerdfighters-in-training:

7
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,260
Tiny Chicken Disease is, of course, a disease in which tiny chickens invade your nose

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,120
and then they

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,720
poop

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,440
snot

11
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,900
which makes you sick.

12
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,140
Right, Hank so over the weekend,

13
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,180
the Yeti got Tiny Chicken Disease

14
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:24,900
and I was like,

15
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,080
"Don't worry! I'm immune to Yeti diseases."

16
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,280
Well I'm not!

17
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,920
Hank, I don't want to gross you out or anything,

18
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,160
but last night,

19
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,540
I drank like 14 liquid tons of snot.

20
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,720
It was like chinese water torture,

21
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,780
except instead of water dripping onto my forehead,

22
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,000
it was just snot

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,440
dripping down my throat,

24
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,480
all night.

25
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,460
And I didn't sleep and now I'm walking around with like

26
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,040
28 000 pounds of chicken poop in my body.

27
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,240
It's just not comfortable.

28
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,720
The weirdest thing about tiny chickens is that you become--

29
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,580
[phone ringing]

30
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,580
Sarah.

31
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,980
Yeah?

32
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,500
What's up?

33
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,420
[Sarah]: Don't forget to vote!

34
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,220
Ohhhhhh

35
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,980
Are you serious?

36
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,740
[Sarah]: Yeah.

37
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:06,740
UGGGGGH

38
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,200
I DON'T WANNA VOTE TODAY.

39
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,260
I'M SICK.

40
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,640
Hank, after I failed to vote in Florida in the 2000 presidential election,

41
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,180
I made a promise to myself

42
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,400
and to my country

43
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,020
that I would always vote.

44
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,380
Alright, let's go.

45
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,220
But I'm taking you with me!

46
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:21,880
Hank, don't get me wrong.

47
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,800
I like voting,

48
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,940
I'm grateful to vote,

49
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,620
I just don't think my vote matters that much.

50
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,100
And I don't meant that in the obvious way,

51
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,700
like, "lots of people vote and my vote only counts once",

52
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,340
I mean that whenever I'm doing like Crash Course research,

53
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,060
I've become increasingly convinced that

54
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,400
the most important actors in human history aren't voters,

55
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,880
they're microbes.

56
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,180
I went to the wrong polling place.

57
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,760
[door opening]

58
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,440
Now I have to try again.

59
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,160
On the upside, I met nerdfighting poll workers, Neil and Aidan.

60
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,660
Alright, let's try again.

61
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,340
Uggggggh

62
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,540
I vote.

63
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,620
I count.

64
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,680
The tiny chickens will win in the end, Hank,

65
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,900
but until then,

66
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,120
I'm doing my part.

67
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,500
See you on Friday.

68
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,520
PS. Nerdfighters,

69
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,120
Hank and I will be hanging out via Google+ tomorrow afternoon

70
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,720
on the Crash Course channel.

71
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,240
Go to <youtube.com/crashcourse> and subscribe to watch it.

72
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,240
It'll be tomorrow afternoon

73
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,620
at 3pm Eastern Time;

74
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,440
I don't know what time that is in your timezone.

75
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,580
I'm sick and tired

76
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,440
and I'm sorry

77
00:02:13,440 --> 00:00:00,000
but you can look it up on this amazing thing called the Internet.
