a story about a this kind of little schlub a nebbish in hollywood who's come out to be a big film maker a little bit of success and they're all melted away and now he's turning 30 he's not happy he knows he can see he's going down that road where he's never gonna quite make it never gonna pull away Hollywood is filled with people like this and everything is just kind of going wrong in his life and one day he opens the door walks through the door and he finds himself in a locked room in a medieval castle a dead body on the floor and a bloody dagger in his hand and the cards kick down the door grab him drag him throw him into a dungeon and tell him he's going to trial for his life and he can't he can't believe thinks he must have a brain to him and the weird thing that keeps happening to him is every now and again he'll go through another door he'll be back in Hollywood like a minute later a second later than no time passes and in Hollywood he finds that people are hunting him all of a sudden and he has no idea why and so these two mysteries were unfolding on - in two completely different worlds and yet somehow this one character there's nobody this guy that nobody's ever heard of nobody ever would hurt Europe is somehow holding these two worlds together and holding these two mysteries together and has to find the answer before he gets himself killed so how do you come up with the ideas for these fictional worlds especially this one normally been doing hard-boiled fiction and this one is is hard well fiction slash fantasy which is a really interesting mashup this one you know I only recently realized how this book came to be because it's happened so organically and looking back on it it's actually a big experience I mean I was a crime writer that's all I ever did was crime and suspense and and I would turn out a book every year to two years but I was always working on a novel and then I got to the point where I wrote my memoir the great good thing and without even noticing it I stopped I stopped writing I didn't even notice it was happening because I was continually writing short stories I wrote a couple of books that I didn't publish that I threw away and only looking back on it that I realized that writing that memoir I had finally put down all the stuff that I had been thinking about and had worked out all the problems that made my fiction tick because you're always as a novelist you're actually writing beyond what you know because you're actually working ideas out in stories in the story form so you're not you're not saying like oh here's a story that's gonna be about X Y & Z you're saying here's a story about a guy doing this and only later do you realize oh it was kind of about X Y & Z that I've been thinking about on this side so when I wrote the great good thing I actually caught up with myself and I realized now I've answered all these questions that powered all the stories of my youth I didn't have anything else really to say and when I was becoming a Christian one of the repeated thoughts that was going through my mind was oh Lord don't let me become a Christian novelist because you know what they're like that horrible horrible stuff like like oh I lost my bunny but Jesus brought it back so I didn't want to do that and I wrote two novels that were essentially Christian novels that I didn't like and one of them I tried and tried to rewrite and I tried again and again I was sitting at a table in my living room with a manuscript and I caught on the coffee table and this notepad trying to fix it and I realize I'm gonna have to throw this book out I've been working on this but for years we have to throw this book away and almost simultaneously another kingdom went bang just dropped into my mind and it came in hole and my process is usually I get a little idea I put it away for six months it comes back it's bigger it gets bigger over a course every year it finally flushes out it was all there and when I sat down to write it I thought well I have an entire story is there and so I really didn't realize what had happened but I wasn't gonna look a gift horse in the mouth and I just started writing the story out and it came very organically the world created itself like I didn't even sit there normally I'm very very picky and do a lot of outlines and here's where this city is gonna be here's where that cities gonna be all of it just worked itself out and in an instant you know and I realized that my subconscious had solved this problem it had solved the problem of how to write a book once you have gotten to a point where you actually have a belief system because belief systems kill fiction you know the world fiction is like the world you can put any number of beliefs onto the world that that work you know and fiction should be the same way it should show life so honestly that Aniela scan look at a work by a fiction by a Christian and say like yeah I understand that and it kind of he thinks he's Christian but the story is not all our stuff and I needed to get beyond that and I think the thing about another Kingdom is it because it works on two levels because it's a very realistic thriller story very gritty we kind of knew our thriller story and also this very almost old-fashioned medieval you know a fantasy story it's these two levels in in my own mind talking to one another the fact that I am a realist I believe that the world is a material world I believe that everything can be explained through materialism that every piece of our bodies can you know I could trade every thought in my mind the same time I believe that there is a new mineral plane that where the spirit lives and that that our flesh tells a story about our flesh is telling a story about the spirit you know and so it actually allowed me to write that without ever writing a Christian book so how did you avoid becoming didactic because I noticed that you know I've written a bunch of non-fiction books I wrote one fiction book it was much harder for me than writing nonfiction yeah because nonfiction is me expressing my views and exploring philosophy but fiction it's like well am I supposed to be veiling the idea or am I supposed to be telling a story and if I tell a story I'm why am I getting bored with my own story how did how did you bridge that gap between now you have a set worldview but still being interested in the fiction that you're writing yourself because it seems to me that's sometimes the number one barrier of being a writer is being interested in what you're doing on a daily basis that's it you have to put it aside you actually have to put it aside you have to trust yourself to see the world as you see it but you have to love your characters you have to let your characters live the life they live you know you can't you can't write a Macbeth who doesn't actually believe in what he's doing you can't write a villain who doesn't actually think like he's right some level you know who isn't actually know you're an idiot for being the good guy I've got I figured it out you know you have to live with that so there's an element of almost method acting in it where when you are in the mind of the character you're there you're just completely believing what he says in that way you let the story go you let it go you you're here with your beliefs you're here with your vision you let the story go and just tell itself what's your process for writing I mean you said that you do a lot of outlining does that turn it workman like or did you actually sit down and you just kind of let it flow it's the only part of my work I hate the outlining I mean it's boring it's you know it's close work and you just have to sit there and do it there's no excitement no character in it even though I write a lot of biographies for characters and things like that however if you do that work I've now learned when you sit down to write you're free you know you know that in this scene the guy is gonna you know run down that hallway and he's gonna find such-and-such and you don't have to sit there stare at that blank screen which is of course the nightmare of every writer writer has so I do do that I do a lot of prep work and it's really helpful and what I now try to do is I try and do it a little bit of day because it's just so excruciating it's just the one part of the job I love my work and I really do love it and I but it's the one part of the job I just think I got to do this I got to work it out so what's your schedule on a day-to-day basis because you come in here you don't get a lot of sleep you coming here you do your podcast and then you're writing hours and hours a day how do you first of all how do you clear the time and second of all so take me from you wake up to you go to bed base what's your schedule during your normal day well I wake up I wake up at the you know 5:15 five to the thirty yet aweful I know and the first thing I do like I say hello to my wife and I grab my iPad I start reading the news you know what's going on guess catching up on everything and I do that pretty solidly until I start to prep the show which you know I'm prepping the show by around 6:30 plus you know and and then I do that I stop I stop for maybe about 45 minutes to do kind of faith stuff I read the Gospels and in Greek which I'm so proud of I taught my school creaking and and then I read some Old Testament some faith you know other other kinds of stuff and then come in and do the show and then I go home right you know and I somebody asked me how do I got along with no sleep and I told them I take naps while other people are expressing their opinions but but yeah no I I just keep going and then I'm done by about 7:00 so I'm working a long day but I'm sure you do too I'm working like a 1214 hours yeah I mean what time you go to sleep normally I go to sleep late because I don't sleep a lot so I go to how do you deal with how you work oh yeah yeah I just on coffee I mean those do you use any of it no I've never taken anything like that I take I don't drink that much coffee I drink like two two and a half cups of coffee there you know and like I just don't sleep I don't like going to bed I don't like being asleep you know I feel like I'm missing something you know one of those internet phrases fear of missing out so I kind of like I felt the same way and then I have young kids you know I can avoid it I couldn't wait for them to go there that for sure but then it's like now I just need to fall over because maybe I ragged and and I do take cat naps that was the one thing when I was a little kid Thomas Edison was my hero and he always he took cat naps I think I modeled that on him so that really helps okay so let's go through some of your faith journey because you know the obviously that's shaping how you're seeing the world in terms of your fiction writing and you have a pretty interesting faith journey obviously you and I ended up in very separate places but but you you started off you're born into a Jewish family I've said to you before we've had this conversation but you you were born into extraordinarily secular Jewish family right so and now obviously you're religious Christians how do you get from point A to point B well the weird thing about my family was there was secular but it was also committed to my father at least was committed to the traditions so we went to Hebrew school we were bar Mitzvahed we learned this stuff but it did occur to me that I've always had this I don't call it an obsession that's a little too much but I've always had this idea that things should make sense if things don't make sense you should change your mind and and part of that was because of a kind of dysfunctional atmosphere in my house where we were taught a lot of philosophical ideas that were just untrue and and it's very damaging you know because you don't want to tear away from your family but at the same time you want to find the truth and so I became kind of obsessed with finding the truth so you there praying and you're there learning Hebrew which is not my language and you're there wearing the you know the Hat and the thing you think well if there's no God and my mother was a stone atheist and my father was just kind of like you know he didn't want to even want to get in trouble with God but like he wasn't exactly believin to me that and and after when I stress I think well this is ridiculous this is ridiculous so after my bar mitzvah I mean that was kind of the turning point I was bar Mitzvahed I got thousands of dollars worth of gifts that I put in this box and one day I got up and threw the box away because with everything in it and I just thought like you know this the old lady at the end of Titanic yeah exactly it'll gotten games you know this is not what I I wanted I didn't really I expect it to live my life as a sort of intellectual agnostic you know like the way I mean I think this kind of it was the default position of thinking men and my day you know and it's kind of still is still now is that yeah right and I and I think that was going to be it that was really my position which is very flattering to the intellectual mind because you can analyze everything into dust if you just no matter how small the point is you can break it up into even smaller pieces because you don't have that bottom line there has to be meaning there has to be more ality that has me the problem was when I was 19 I read crime and punishment and it convinced me that the moral world existed it convinced me that cotton was right there was the starry sky above and the moral law within and that was that was undeniably true and because of that I kept circling around where does this morality and meaning come from and I'm not I wasn't satisfied with things I hear from guys like our pal Jordan Peterson the the Italian philosopher marchello Peres you know I say just live as if there were God I think to live as if there were a god is essentially to want the conclusions of a syllogism whose premises you don't accept right and it just makes no sense and so again everything had to make sense to me and and ultimately I mean I had when I was a kid I've lived like these two lives I had terrible emotional problems because I had a terrible relationship with my father my my household was dysfunctional in this very invisible way there's not a lot of violence there's not a lot of hatred it was just this kind of invisible dysfunction and so I cracked up you know there came a point when I was like 28 years old I just stopped working basically I just went boom you know something's wrong and at that point which was would have been the smart point to seize hold of God like a piece of driftwood floating by in the ocean I thought like well that then I'll never believe because it'll always be this thing I did because I was weak because I was down on my luck because I was broken it'll always be this crutch that I see used to hold up it's just really how stubborn I was about things making sense you know and and so instead by the grace of God I found a shrink who cured me and I always laugh about this I'm the only person I've ever known it was cured by psyche but but he did you know it within the course of like 2 3 years of talking to this guy I was a completely different human being and it was only then when I felt sane when I felt certain that my impressions were correct when I felt certain that I was not in a delusional life that it seemed obvious to me that there was God because of my moral stance in the stance that if everybody on earth there was a time there was a time when everybody on earth believed this slavery was right even the slaves they would have said yeah I don't want to be the slave but this is the way things are at that time slavery was wrong and once you say that you're screwed with God wise I mean you cannot you cannot get away from the idea that somewhere there is this moral base this base of meaning and this is the thing that's become fascinating to me now because they're guys like you and me who actually believe but we're kind of anomalies in the world of the thinking man I think there's a there is right now the world of the thinking man's divided by into two on one side you have people like Jordan Peterson Marcela Parra Douglas Perry who wrote that book the strange death of Europe and we're back the novel is weird like not will but who are basically saying the West can't survive without the judeo-christian thesis we should all ascribe to the judeo-christian thesis I myself do not believe right they're all saying the same thing I myself cannot believe on the other side you have these guys like you've all her re and who wrote say pians and Steven Pinker who say no no no my friend you know we are going up and up and up this has been an absolute no get to her Ari I think the Harari is at least more intellectually honest and then Pinker I mean I think the Pinker does this whole routine where the Enlightenment will save us and everything is going to continuously get better and you carve away the foundations of Western civilization nothing will crumble and Harare is basically like well maybe civilization sucked in the first place right just go back to living in the fields and we were happy when we were eating grass and all this kind of stuff and at least at least he's honest that way and he has this kind of Vulcan idea that we're all living in a delusion like he's the problem with him is he says the most unique his phrase I would never say the most unique but he does he says the most unique thing about sapiens is the fictions we create so we have a fiction that there's a god we have a fiction that we have human rights we have a fiction of money money hasn't values us but that's not how fiction works I mean fiction fiction described something it does not create things I can I can create a delusional world through fiction but good fiction it describes reality so money is a good example money describes the value of something to a human being when he has a lot of it or when he doesn't have a lot of it that's what it describes you know it's actually it actually does have a value that we're accepting the the paper doesn't but the idea does and because Harare is a Vulcan who doesn't accept that there is a human life that matters he thinks it's all being created by the fictions but the fictions are being created by that internal life well it's talk some more about this

Shapiro Robin Hood calm that's Ben Shapiro Robin Hood calm okay so let's go back to where we were here yeah I I agree I mean I think that there is this this divide and neither of the two sides of the divide are destined to preserve the civilization right you can't though I agree there's the one side with folks like Jordan and I love Jordan but Jordan's Jordans essential argument which is that all of the outgrowth of Western civilization are fantastic all of the outgrowths of judeo-christian value systems are great these myths represent fundamental values but then he boils that down to repeated game play through Piaget it's like well I asked him this when he was sitting in your seat yeah I said well then why is it that all of these values only emerged in one culture over time like this is that this is the unanswerable question for folks who think there's nothing special about judeo-christian civilization if you all think that it's evolutionary biology if you all think like EO Wilson that anything can be driven by genetics and environment we're not all that different are you gonna tell me that because the climate was slightly different in China than it was in Europe that's what generated these massive differences in human rights and belief in the individual that occurred over thousands of years is that that's really what happened here so you've got that that one system where folks basically argue that there is a truth but not really a truth like Jordans at least honest enough to acknowledge when he says that something is true he doesn't mean it's objectively true right he sort of means it's useful and then you have the folks who say well then there's the objectively true sam harris evo Harari there's no such thing as free will there's no such thing as civilization these are all fictional creations but then they rely on those principles in order to create an impetus for change right because they'll say we need to work toward something better or we need like there are so many different falsities in that one statement we need to work toward something better that's right like how do you work if in a world with no free well what is better in this world and what are is this need coming from because even when you say that we need to do something and you say well that's based on human flourishing we have a lot of different definitions of human flourishing this idea that human flourishing is just basic Marxist materialism is quite insane I mean if that were the case we would not have a crisis of conscience in the West right now where the richest we've ever been in human history that's why and why should I care whether humans flourish or not as long as I get mine and right that is the you know all of these guys who failed to deal with the - what to me is this immense elephant in the room which is the elephant of narrative and you know I frequently talk about the fact that George Washington was a massive hero of Liberty a man who essentially gave the the airing nothing of Liberty a local habitation in the name but by turning down the kingship by doing what he did but he didn't understand why his slaves didn't work hard he didn't understand why his slaves when he treated them well would escape and he think well how is that possible that this hero of Liberty didn't understand the desire for liberty that's a narrative that is what the the kind of atmosphere of value that surrounds us all that we don't even know is there the left makes the mistake that they think that narrative is fact they think if you control the narrative the facts will change the right makes the mistake of thinking that facts will always triumph over narrative and that's just not true either and the thing is we are living and this is the the one thing I agree with Pinker on although he wouldn't think I was agreeing with him we are living in what I call the Enlightenment narrative Rome fell plunged into darkness the church held us in this superstition then hora their classic works were rediscovered we were reborn in the Renaissance we moved into the Enlightenment you know people got rid of Protestantism for deism deism fell apart that science marched on now we're free into you know to march into the heavenly world through atheism listen I think there's a lot of truth in that you know it's true that when Ben Franklin invented the lightning rod the churches were still ringing the bells to chase the demons away when lightning came which we didn't work out well for the bell ringers not a good place to be yeah and it's true you know the church is always saying well the story of Galileo is much more complex it is but it's exemplary of misplaced religious authority religious authority should not have the capability to say to a scientist no the earth goes here instead of there that's the scientists job so that it's true to that extent but the other side of this is exactly what you're talking about it only happened in the West the invention of science as we know it happened because Christian members of the church almost all of them Christian deeply believe in Christian man started to think well if the world makes sense if God made us in His image it must be through the through the connection of reason let us use our reason to understand the starry heavens that God has put in front of us you know it's like all all of this was built into judeo-christian thought and and so you know when Jesus said not only will you do the works I've done you'll do even greater works that may well have been what he was talking about he may have said think like this and the world will open itself up to you and that's I think the the narrative that we have got to start to tell because this narrative has got people I think like Jordan and Perry and Marcelo para it's got them in its grip and they can't get out of it in the same way that Washington couldn't see his slaves should be free they can't say that God has given them everything it seems like a soft form of the argument that you hear most people make about why they became it religious the first place which is not that they stopped believing in God but because people suck so what they'll say is that they'll say I stopped being religious because I saw all these religious people who are acting like jerks as well that's not a referendum on god that's a referendum on human being sucking this is this is this goes back to another Kingdom which is the thing that I realized was I was looking back on it now all I was doing it looking back on this the reason we can't write a Christian good Christian novel is that people believe up not down you don't explain to them Aquinas said this and then they say ah now I see there must be a god and therefore I will believe they get to God they climb to God on the ladder of being you know and that ladder the first step of that ladder is that life is good not your life not my life but life itself when when Hamlet says to be or not to be that is the question that is the question once you decide in favor of being then you start to say that life is good and just like you were saying before that their sentence makes no sense we must work to get better the sentence that life is good and makes no sense unless you have at the top of that ladder an actual referendum on meaning and morality which turns out to be God yeah I mean this is what it says in Deuteronomy right choose lights that you and your children may live this is right there I mean the most important sentences in human history for all the crap the Bible has taken all of the most important sentences in human history are in that book right I mean the to me the most the single most important sentence ever written whether you believe it was by God or by man doesn't really matter for this point when you say that man is made in God's image that is the single most important sentence ever written because all of human Liberty all of human rights all of individual equality all of that is based in that in that root belief and that is something you have to take on faith and this is where the Enlightenment thinkers you know make me crazy because I think that first of all I think there's a false a falsification of enlightenment history when you suggest that all of the Enlightenment thinkers were basically militant atheists who decided to reject Church that's just not the case Locke spent half his life doing a Christian apologetics and Wright Newton Newton - and and even even Voltaire was smart enough to recognize and his old own kind of Peter Sonia in fashion that well I'm not somebody who deeply believes I certainly hope that my servants are all right because doesn't want them stealing the silverware so it's the the difference between the England the English enlightenment discussion and the American Enlightenment and the Enlightenment of France is that the Enlightenment of France base we said right there is no God there is no moral system and using the pure light of human reason we can recreate any moral system that we choose and folks who are kind of new Enlightenment thinkers pick that up and they say that that's the stuff that created the modern world and I just don't understand that what created the modern world is this common law believing solidly religious community that had it as its fringe Enlightenment thinkers all of whom recognized that without a moral and religious people all of this would collapse into dust nearly immediately this is the thing the try you know I don't understand this either like the pinker does this Jonah Goldberg who I love I think he's a wonderful writer but he does it in his book as they pick on the Romantics and they say oh the romantics they want to go back to feeling which is I mean these were some of the most brilliant men who ever lived they weren't sitting around going oh my fields you know they were actually thinking about something what they were thinking about was that without religion matter and meaning had become irreparably separated how do we bring them back together knowing what we know now you know and they the thing is they saw the French Revolution Wordsworth was there he went to France he saw the French Revolution he saw the priests bayonetted in the streets he came back and he said you know what this reason thing is problematic you know and they crucified him they did just what they do to conservatives today you know they were writing poems about what a jerk he was you know Robert Browning wrote this thing about how he sold out by becoming the poet laureate a position he turned down like three times before he finally took it Hey but he saw this thing go wrong and so he said like like the second level of British romantics guys like Coleridge and I had feats and Shelley and but they saw it something had happened you know that this wasn't working guys like Pinker it's like it never happened there was no terror it's amazing he writes a 400 page book called enlightenment now and there's I check the index the first thing I did when I got the book there's not a single mention of the French Revolution a book titled enlightenment now and I don't know how that is even possible how is that even humanly possible and I listen I like a lot of things even before me - I took a class with him when I was at Harvard it was a weird class him Alan Dershowitz teaching it but it was it but that necessity on the one hand to paint the Enlightenment as all good no bad so there's the Enlightenment then there's the counter enlightenment everything bad we can attribute to the counter right right and then there is the feeling that the enlightenment is only bad because the people I don't like are part of it all right so the enlightenment is either Rousseau so everybody gets the Enlightenment wrong in my view basically I think there's there's the one side the Patricks I mean wild liberalism failed which is taking the leftist premise or not the leftist premise but this kind of neo Enlightenment premise that the Enlightenment was atheistic and individualistic without any regard for virtue and that's what's destroyed the West and then you have people like Pinker taking the other side saying well that's what built the West is that individualistic enlightenment no virtue we're all just kind of man to billion B's and we bounce off of each other all the time and the reality is that what built America was the conjunction of virtue and rights it was a deep belief on the part of every single founder including founders who considered themselves deists that if you did not believe in at least a Greek geological version of virtue if you do not believe in natural law then none of this mattered in the first place that's the practice but we'll drink me I don't know how you read any of these Enlightenment thinkers where the foundations for either British enlightenment or American Enlightenment and the way they talk about natural law and not see that that has some sort of connection to you know the 2000 year Christian history of natural Lanka yeah there's it's also you can't sloth off 2,000 years of Christian history there's that you cannot just rewrite your mind into this completely blank slate it just doesn't work this one I said it Sam Harris and address it drove me a wall I mean it's it's just hehehe I really like Sam his person but he's never answered at least to my satisfaction the simple question is why he and I hold the same values like we have 95% of the same values and I said to him you know where these values coming from Sam he said well you know I studied Buddhism and I studied philosophy in when I was at I think it's at Berkeley or Stanford and I and you know I studied all this stuff and said right but I didn't study into that stuff and we have the same basic morality could it be that maybe it's because we live in a judeo-christian culture created by 3,000 years of common history you know maybe be that one of the most telling narratives of the of the American Founding is the moment when Benjamin Frank Franklin rewrote a portion of the Declaration and Jefferson had said that our rights were sacred and Franklin said our rights are self-evident because Franklin was a scientist right if you think about that what Franklin was saying is we now know enough to do satellites we now know enough that we you know you don't always know that much but we now have enough information but what was that information it was surely the information that had been formed over thousands of years of Christian shaping molding of the Western mind it was the idea that you were an individual the idea that you were sacred that you mattered that you were made in God's image all those things didn't just disappear from Franklin's mind because he was a bit of a vague vague about religion because he wasn't a very good theological thinker when he said that it was self it was self-evident but it wasn't self-evident 2,000 years before that right and I think that that was a great advance in our knowledge in the same way I was talking about how I wrote my memoir I where I could now contain what I said I think the Constitution and the Declaration are just that I think that is European history saying here's what we know so far here is what we know about governance it didn't just come out it didn't just pop out of like Cicero's mind it actually was shaped it informed the Greeks and the Romans shaped and formed by these two thousand years of Christian Judeo Christian thought which made it what it is and you don't just get rid of that it obviously is the cauldron in which we were all shaped now I'm talk a little bit about you know the the gas running out of the tank so to speak in Western civilization but first let's talk about your imminent demise so life insurance is really important one-third of people don't have it that's because it's actually kind of hard to buy you have to work out what you need and then you do the research to find the best quote and then you hope that you don't get swindled along the way it's not a good way to shop for anything let alone life insurance so policy genius has made the whole process a lot easier policy genius compares quotes from the top life insurance companies and they find the best policy for you it takes two minutes to get a quote that's simple and if you don't know the first thing about insurance well they've got all the tools to get you up to speed you can learn the difference between term and whole life insurance you can calculate how much coverage you need you can be sure that you're making the right decision in fact over four million people have used policy genius to shop for insurance policy genius doesn't just make life insurance easy they also do disability insurance and home insurance and auto insurance if you care about it they can cover it so whether you know a lot about life insurance or you know nothing at all you can start your search of policy genius Scott again two minutes to compare quotes and make an informed decision for you and your loved ones when your plots don't leave your loved ones shoving you into a paupers tomb instead go to policy genius and make sure that you've got the life insurance you actually need and when you listen this conversation between me and drew and what you will see is that you have the life insurance that you need for the afterlife but for this life you're going to need some money if you fly so go check it out right now policy genius the easy way to compare and buy life insurance okay so I get the feeling right now there is a crisis of conscience happening in the West a crisis of meaning I see it particularly among young people I think that it's manifested itself in this new attempt to buy young people particularly claw their way back to some sort of philosophy that provides meaning for them and you're seeing people Kallang in every direction so you're seeing a lot of folks who are returning to Jordan's worldview that there is something worth fighting for here and while he and I and you and he may disagree on how far that goes we agreed probably on eight of the 10 steps that you need to get to the final two being you need to believe in God you need to believe a moral system springing from God but he doesn't he may disagree with that although he's never been like incredibly clear on that and then there are people who are clawing their way back to meaning through partisan tribalism which is I'm just gonna find the group that believes most like me and I will find meaning in my life by clubbing the crap out of people whoever I don't like them all of this speaks to me of a problem that actually did exist in the Enlightenment and that was that the Enlightenment didn't necessarily want to discard God or judeo-christian morality but it ended up doing so that's right and so we've been living off of these fundamental premises of religion for 200 years while simultaneously undermining religion itself so we've been saying reason means everything well where does reason come from and why why isn't it just random synapses firing in your brain that are evolutionarily beneficial we believe in a predictable universe that we can explore through through science what makes you believe in a predictable universe where are you getting that from why isn't it just us theorizing and then some theories work in some theories don't and where where do you get the idea that there is a good and there is a bad where do you get the idea of any sort of directional human living where were you getting all of these ideas and folks who don't believe in a judeo-christian foundation for our civilization I don't know how they answer that question and I think most people don't know the answers and so what we've fallen into is sort of either a passionate rejection of the question itself as in the Bible stupid all of this is stupid I don't really care so your question stupids I'm just gonna do what I want to do and I'll ignore the question or engaging with the question which inevitably takes you to nihilism if you actually can't find meaning anywhere it seems to me that sort of the split I think that one of the problems too is that nobody is engaged with the question of whether and this is what I believe I believe atheism is obsolete I believe it actually made sense after Newton you know one of the reasons the romantics he hated Newton is they feared that by the logic of his science he had taken the fantastic and the beautiful and spiritual out of life and the Romantic poets Wordsworth and Keith's would toast long life to Newton and confusion to mathematics I didn't you know they thought that he was taking the enchantment out of why I think baseball fans in hate bill game exactly know it exactly like that but the thing is that that made sense at that point to think like ah well here he's gotten logic for this so eventually we're gonna have this clockwork universe where everything is gonna hold together but in fact along the way if you've paid attention that clockwork universe has started to get a little weird you know that we have effects at the quantum level that don't make any sense at all in terms of clockwork interplays between consciousness and reality that really do to me suggest an idea of consciousness at the very beginning of creation we have this this other idea that suddenly when I say that life is good and that implies a lot of philosophical problems one of them is how can there possibly be life the odds against there being life are fantastic and so guys like Pinker have invented this completely bogus idea that there are infinite universes and this just happens to be the universe right unfalsifiable which means I know it is not science well they used to say the religious people had God of the gaps right a god yeah but this is religion a science of the gaps yeah and and there's that and then there's this other thing which essentially is faith which is the idea that we're living in kind of as a computer simulation which just means that God is a little nerd sitting there so he's a few pad Manzanilla and so it's actually that our narrative has not caught up with our knowledge I think our knowledge has gone beyond the fact where we have to deduce an atheistic clockwork world and it's dangerous I think that you and I both believe this it is a dangerous place to live without meaning one of the things that truly bothered me about Pinker's work and I don't again to pick on it you know his stuff said he's he's the stand-in version right that's all and I think he's a man of goodwill writing what he thinks and all this but he he denigrates intellectuals who say oh we've got a problem coming up he says this is kind of natural for intellectuals to do to see a crisis everywhere he says we've gotten to where we have to talk about a serious crisis just to make sure people understand what we're saying and every time I would read that I would think about the Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee which was the last time that civilization was at this pinnacle I mean just a amazing pinnacle that it had never been at before in England but in your throughout and they asked the poet Kipling to write about it and he wrote that famous poem recessional where he said you know Lord God of hosts he'd be with us yet lest we forget lest we forget if we leave God behind and he was no great believer coupling but he said if we leave God behind well collapse now that's the kind of prediction that Pinker laughs at but seventeen years later which is nothing seventeen years later after this pinnacle of civilization thirty years of absolute total war took place that wiped the high culture of Europe off the map the high culture of Europe ends in 1914 to 1945 with one of the worst cataclysms of evil that has ever taken place in the history of humankind followed by because of this anti-christian philosophy of Nazism followed by these decades of mass murder in the name of this atheist philosophy of communism that suggests to me that the Enlightenment narrative is not quite everything that it cracked up to be and so I think this is a serious crisis I think that personally I think that Immanuel Kant at the very beginning of the Enlightenment saw it coming and gave us a roadmap to to a different way of thinking about religion a different way of thinking about both Jewish Judaism and Christianity which is though is the way that I think about is is almost in terms of language and storytelling that yes we are flesh and blood yes we are a flesh bag of chemicals but you're also been and you are the represent you are the language that speaks to me and to you a Ben you are a word like your flesh your body is a word meaning men and that ban is is real in the new mineral world or in the mind of God if you want as as this flesh-and-blood everything about everything about the words coming out of my mouth as physical my brain is sparking my you know if one's are pushing it off but the ideas when I'm expressing you aren't physical at all and they're either true or they're false and they're false whether I speak them or not and all of that is really to me what the Christian story is it's the word be made flesh it is that the life of God becoming seeable realizable which I think each of us is at some level and I think I think it's why Jesus spoke in parables it's not because of necessarily the meaning of the parables but the mechanism of the parables once you accept the mechanism that I can tell you a story of man's son ran away and then came back and he welcomed him back I can tell you that story and you hear moral meaning in it you know that it has moral meaning once you do that you accept that your life is like that too it is a physical story with a moral meaning and to me that's all in a way but when Moses stands before the burning bush and he sees this eternal thing of destruction and creation but you know either but growing bushes and it says I am I am a an am I am and I you know that that to me is what this is all about and it's completely believable it is completely believable in the realm of science you don't have to eliminate science you don't have to make up you know magic stories about lost bunnies you don't have to do anything like that to understand that this world that we're living in is a world of morality and meaning and it cannot be that way without the God we know well how do you deal with you know the folks like Sam Harris you spend a lot of time just clubbing the Bible like a baby seal and it's in my and when I had Sam in the room and we were talking about this I he spent an awful lot of time trying to pick out you know parts of the Bible that he didn't like to which my statement was well the reason you don't like it is because you've been living in a in a world that has been shaped by that document that you really don't like very much and you know the statement that I made to him with regard to sort of the evolution of morality is that there are certain things that God says that are predicated on an eternal unchanging human nature and then there's certain things that are that God is saying to people of a time because God still has to speak a language to a human being and human beings are incapable of understanding language that's to be written a thousand years from now but still how do you how do you deal with all the skepticism of religion these days because you're making a pretty sophisticated argument about religion I think the arguments that I think about religion are similarly sophisticated but that's not the religion that most people are taught when they're young right and and so it seems like that provides easy mince meat for for cynics who can spend the rest of the day just as you are I could going through and cherry-picking verses that we find troubling on their face but their arguments not fair because what Sam Harris does and I like him too you know I read what he does is he takes cutting-edge science and compares it to the most fundamental literalist religion all the time and he says that's fair because he says that science corrects itself but religion is essentially fundamentalist that's just not true it's just not true all human thought corrects itself and it corrects itself by comparing itself to reality you know of reality doesn't you know you Chafee ology hasn't changed over the last four thousand years that's that's a ridiculous thesis so what I think it's statement to be fair to him is that theology theoretically shouldn't change because if it's the eternal Word of God then why exactly is J your understanding that it's unfolding to us what he is essentially saying is if you can turn on a light bulb but you can't invent a light bulb then science doesn't exist that's what he's saying because what he's saying is if I can pray and experience God but I can't talk theology and I'm just a simple guy and I just believe in this imagery then God doesn't exist he's making the same argument there it plenty of people say plenty of stupid things about science that doesn't mean science isn't real plenty of people say simple and simplistic things about religion that doesn't mean God isn't real it's ridiculous you know they're not arguing I want to see Harris argue with Aquinas I don't want to see Harris argue with some guy who just knows that God is there and has given him faith and meaning and purpose in his life you may not be able to explain that anywhere that I can really explain what happens when I flick on the switch and the light magically comes on you know so that the debate is not fair and it begins thicker has this thing he does where he says well you know the Holocaust wasn't because of genetic science and the nuclear explosions on her Oshima wasn't because of nuclear science and global warming's not because of industrial science but the Crusades is because of religion well yeah you can't you can't do all this stuff is because if you medieval humans do bad things they do with science they do with God my argument against this is the Bible was written by men we're not Muslims Muslims believe that the Quran was written with the finger of God and those words themselves contain the truth I don't think Jews or Christians believe that even literalist Christians I'm not one I mean but even ones who believe in the absolute we don't believe this because we can translate in the Bible the Bible can be translated the Quran cannot that Muslims will tell you if you're reading the Quran not in Arabic you're not reading the Quran but the Bible can be translated because it was written by men to communicate what God had told them right men make mistakes there's a major debate so there's to be fair there's men Orthodox Judaism over this because okay there's the idea that God did in fact write the Torah and that was all written on Mount Sinai by Moses he as dictated by God at the time and there was major debate for literally over a thousand years and Judaism about whether it was good or not to translate the Bible's there is predicate for for that Quranic view at the same time what Judaism has that I don't believe and I don't wanna get this wrong but I don't believe chronic religion does have a lot of is there was this common-law tradition in Judaism that also sprang from the same the same now so even people who are very fundamentalist about what they believe about the giving of Bible also believe that at least in Judaism that there was an oral torah that was given at the same exact time which was meant to explain to human beings what exactly this text meant jaitley provides the capacity for us to understand what was happening the vast world for us yeah right it's really not the written stuff so so I mean I think that this is this is important though I mean my personal belief and this is not necessarily the you know the Orthodox belief but my personal belief is that the Bible was written down by men it is the story of God explaining himself to men over time you don't have to say you can't take any one sentence out of it and say here is you know it's not like a fractal where each sentence ooh shows you the entire world of God each sentence shows you a history I mean the the Old Testament is a history a tremendous cycle of of coming out of nowhere into Empire and back into into these versions all the dispersion and people that's that happens to every people sometimes the cycle is cut short sometimes it goes complete but it shows you where God is at each part in that cycle that's an amazing revelation to me and I think that you can if you can't find the deep truths that have powered Western society to both moral superiority and technological superiority I think you're missing something I don't think you're reading the book right you know I think it's all there you can see it anybody can take a book and read it in a certain way and make it absurd I can do that with Shakespeare my favorite writer I can take him and says say oh this is weird if you read it that way like everything you have to know how to read it and I think that that that was also one of Conn's points where he said we don't we must not thoroughly need revelation because we know the truth when we see it we know we wouldn't recognize revelation if we didn't have something in us to greet revelation so you do have to greet the revelation of the Bible with something within yourself and I think that that's you know again I think what they do with science is they get very very detailed and elegant in their arguments about science which I approve of and then give very blunt and stupid yeah and not one of them has read any theology not one of those atheists has read any serious theology so they're always arguing with a guy on TV they're arguing with that televangelist half the time when you should be I mean Pinker's spent tons of ink arguing about the ghost in the machine I don't know anybody who believes that there's a ghost in the machine you know that's a dead end cartesian belief you know that i think we've we've gotten past and actually before that we had other more sophisticated beliefs so they're just they're just not engaging with real religion so you're very big on cons and conte is is sort of a quasi natural law theorist but not quite and what's your fondness for for con cuz you're obviously a deeply religious Christian tanta is at best a sort of nominal Christian well what Kant what Kant was doing was in the moment that he was what I read him okay and I'm not a sophisticated philosophy reader but you know I have read a lot of it and I this is my take on what he was doing was he saw very early on in the Enlightenment in the this new scientific world as the Germans did that that God was in trouble and our beliefs were in trouble but he also saw what I think is beyond question that morality could not survive the death of God and I think me che saw that too a lot of people saw it you know and so he came up because it is really difficult once you start to actually make the argument that morality doesn't exist you know it sounds good if you're in your dorm smoking dope at 3:00 in the morning but in real life you know you can't really make the serious argument and he saw that so he thought well then there must be a God and in order for there be a God there really must be sort of two planes of existing and and I think this is obviously true the phenomena logical play and phenomenal plane he called it and the Newman old plane so and the phenomenal plane is speaking to us of a new mental plane that we can never quite know and this is the remarkable thing about our cultures I always say our culture's founded on two people Socrates and Jesus both of them were dealing with an intellectual class that didn't believe in truth both of them believed that there was a truth neither of them spoke the truth directly you know Jesus told stories and he said I am the truth which is a very sophisticated difficult you know concept and Socrates was always asking those annoying questions that got him killed you know but they never said they they said there wasn't truth but they were approaching it they're always moving toward it and that's essentially what Kant was doing contact field was kind of rewriting and updating Plato to say that yes there is this world outside the cave where what looking at these shadows but there is a world of light that that creates the shadows we can never quite get to that light but it is there we do can move toward it and he did say that the fundament the fundamentals of Christian belief were you could believe in the fundamentals of Christian belief the afterlife judgment yeah incarnation you could believe in all those things if you believed in this numeral world and so all I'm saying is that he puts down a roadmap of understanding that I have found very helpful it's not like I he also has this wonderful talk about how we receive receive information it takes shape in our minds because our minds have a way of giving it shape but I think it's turned out to be scientifically the case you know that to me is really important because it's one thing to say to me the world is not as I see as a Hugh being you know the table is really just a forcefield or whatever you want to say but it is true that if I turn north at 53rd Street I'll get the 54th Street every single time so the world the phenomenal world that I see it's not I'm yeah it's not untethered to the new middle world and I think that that's important because I think that human beings are important in and of themselves and the way we see them is justified in and of itself so this is a very that you're making a very natural law argument to the extent that you say that the universe is essentially discoverable Khan's argument is that the universe you could not necessarily you could tell teleology from from the universe around you and sort of the Aquinas sense but more that by searching your own moral sensibility you could come up with the idea of God because we all have the interior moral sensibilities so then what need is there for religion in the first place why not just be sort of a Content just just make that your religion because I really do think and when you read the Bible a lot of this has to do with guarantees of the truth the revelation of the burning bush the the revelation of the Incarnation these are things where God is saying to us yes you know don't I I know I know this path makes sense I know this relativistic path can make sense you can analyze things forever and follow this light follow this light and I don't think it's it's one thing to say that we could have thought of that by ourselves but could we have believed it by ourselves I'm not quite sure I'm not I actually don't believe we could yeah I tend to agree with that and I think that this is sort of the Judaic perspective on on Greek thought for example is there's this this famous statement by a Yahoo de la vie was a very famous rabbi and I believe the 11th century and his statement was basically that Greek philosophy is beautiful but has no fruit meaning that it's it's it's wonderful to study and it's wonderful to learn about but it doesn't actually dictate action in the same way that an implicit command to do things does or an implicit yeah rulebook for living does and it's kind of its kind of arrogant of some of these thinkers to say well you know we couldn't even recognize the truth if we didn't already know the truth what difference does that make we're walking around in the dark there's got to be if there's light at the end of the hallway you got to be able to see the light to know which way to work and walk and I think that that really is what our faith does in a face says to do you know but you know when Jesus said you know love God love your neighbor everything else is built on that there's a rabbi right yeah rabbi Hillel same thing that's or the reverse he's the silver rule right he says he says that that which is hateful to your neighbor do not do yeah yeah yeah and and I think that when you have that kind of rule for instance when I'm reading the Bible and it seems to me to be telling me that oh this guy I can get rid of this guy he's no good and go back to that and I say no if I got there I made a mistake and I made a mistake you have to have some basis some light that you're moving toward and revelation is that light I don't think I really don't believe that you can get there any other way and I think it's tremendously arrogant to think that you could think your way to the light because you can think your way right off the edge of a cliff and I've seen people do it so how do we actually Rhian cocaine some of these beliefs because obviously this is you know the the work in which you're engaged is the work in which I'm engage it's and it's it's daunting obviously because you have an entire culture that is built to believe in its arrogance that it could have created all these values just tabula rasa even after a century of us slaughtering each other unprecedented it's yeah it's it's an uphill battle I mean get people people have an easier time believing in no God than in God yep so how do you get to this well you know I think the one of the problems we're having right at this moment is that politics is the opposite of thought in some ways that politics demands that you take it to make a choice between Democrat and Republican you know this one or that one and it's very hard for people to say yeah I'm choosing the Republican but he's a jerk he he's just bet you got a better idea you know this guy is richer hey you know ideas matter a lot ideas really do matter a lot because all of us are so broken and sinful and creepy in some way you know they're like like this whole idea that you can point at somebody and say oh well he did this when he was 17 and therefore you know you think what does he represent tell me first what he represents and then tell me whether he can't represent that or can represent that and so I think that we are fighting over ideas or fighting over the stories we tell I think these two things are immensely equally important and I think that what can we do but speak to these ideas in all their complexity and tell their so our stories as as clearly as we can what can we do and then have faith I do have faith I do believe that ideas that don't make sense collapse I believe that that modernism collapsed because it was secular and post-modernism which makes literally no sense whatsoever you know beep modernism because modern it exposed something in modernism that didn't work secular humanism actually didn't work so I have faith in those ideas the thing that I think we all worry about you'd be fool not to worry about is as you're moving toward the light as you're moving toward the good what horrors will occur and we just don't know you know I mean you live in faith and you live each day hoping that this is not that day so you know I would be remiss if we went through this entire episode and I didn't ask you you're talking a lot about narrative about storytelling I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you about your experiences in Hollywood because obviously you're a Hollywood writer you've made some money writing movies in Hollywood you know how do they do just not talk about any of this around anybody in Hollywood well eventually I've virtually got kicked out I mean I got kicked out one office at a time you know but I still got kicked out you know and that was all politics it was just like during the Bush administration you'd go in and they say Bush's Hitler and you say I'm here to sell a story about ghosts yeah and I I was never able to say you know yes Bush's Hitler or even smile a stupid you know grin and and just accept it I always had to say well I'm on the other side and I would get thrown out and once I became loud enough it really became hard for me to get work I never minded I kind of was dragged into the movie business and I didn't mind getting thrown out and it would be a horrible life to me not be able to be able to speak my mind I mean I'd much rather sit around here talking to you Jeremy even Knowles and be in Hollywood you know and and not be able to say what I thought because I really wanted to get Justice League for you know I want to score yeah I mean that's not that's not my life and I but but it did bother me because not for myself but this thesis that half the country does not deserve to be entertained only instructed if you are one of them you deserve to hear jokes at night if you were one of them you deserve to have movies and spy films and monster movies but if you're us they're essentially every comedian every single one is going to tell you you're an idiot every movie is gonna throw your values down the drain every single film in every TV show it's going to tell you your country stinks your religion stinks your values think your the way you dress is ugly every single one and then the electronica why is everybody so angry like yeah you know you're lucky I think like you're lucky they just sent Trump you're lucky they didn't show up themselves because there's 64 million of them and they would have been well within their rights to come this is what bothers me and it ultimately it all tomorrow's us me about us because I don't need them to let me tell a story I don't need them but they're not so bright they're not so talented they're not so deep that we can't do better we can do better but the problem is is part of the conservative mindset is to see how the disaster might happen and so we're always rushing off to stop the disaster and you know there are three things in life that that always come second place you know children morality and art you know there's always something more important than taking care of your children there's always something more important than doing the right thing there's always something more important than sitting down and writing a novel that's not gonna make you as much money is if you wrote you know like that lousy Trump I hate and more than or the opposite you know so those things need care and conservatives have let them go conservatives have not cared about the artists they have not cared about the narrative and they haven't cared about you know something that people need to light you know they need to be delighted they need to hear they need to see their inner life acted out so that they can reflect on it and look it's like looking in the mirror you know and we've let that go and that was the thing that bothered me most about Hollywood was not that they were there that we weren't you know and and it really and it still bothers me I mean it's you know you call up and say here's an idea about this and I'll go now because everybody knows who I am and what I think I will go into rooms now and say there's 64 million people with 20 bucks in their pocket that you can't reach and I can let me do it and it's like no well I want to end up lefting note and I do have one more
