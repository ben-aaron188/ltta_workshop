Barack Obama is back with his take on 2018 Hillary Clinton learns to love federalism and the anti-science left take center stage I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show you thought he was gone you thought he wouldn't be back what wrong you are he's back and we'll talk about him in just a second but first let's talk about all of the events surrounding election 2018 if you look at the rhetoric from the leftist news outlets on the heels of Brett Kavanaugh s confirmation they're trying to solidify the left for the midterms it is going to be a battle to hold the house here's what's at stake if the Democrats take it all the positive policies Republicans have enacted over the past couple of years all the things to help the economy the tax cuts the judicial appointments the cutting of the regulations all of it could be stymied if the Democrats take control of either the house or the Senate and when they start to obstruct what effect could that have on the economy on stocks and

the country seems to be on the verge of something really really terrible and seems like something that's that's building up frankly on both sides a couple of parallel stories that are really ugly over the last 24 hours Story number one George Soros who is not a person I admire in any way George Soros of course a leftist funder of a bunch of radical causes but he is not a person who ought to be murdered and yet an explosive device was found in the mailbox at his home Monday afternoon according to senior law enforcement is according to the New York Times the device was proactively D notated by bomb squad technicians from the Westchester County Police Department the Bombers motive remains unclear Soros is a favorite target of right-wing groups he was not at home at the time the investigation has been taken over by the FBI all of this is ugly stuff now again I am no George Soros fan I think that George Soros does terrible terrible things for world politics and I think he backs awful causes that doesn't mean that folks should go out bombing him this is insanity and it's not just George Soros according to the Daily Caller House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's office in California was vandalized on Monday according to an Instagram post by the congressman McCarthy who could be the future Speaker of the House his local offices in Bakersfield California he posted photos of the suspects and some of the damage two young men were caught on surveillance camera outside the office it had its windows smashed in by a large boulder and he doesn't know exactly who these folks are he put out the notice McCarthy's office of course is not the first GOP office to be vandalized in recent weeks a Republican Party office in Wyoming was intentionally set on fire two days after it opened in September vandals later hit the Metropolitan Republican Club on Manhattan's Upper East Side in October smashing windows and spray-painting anarchist signs on the doors so all just wonderful stuff and yesterday there is a dangerous situation in Washington DC a suspected intruder was shot after kicking down the glass doors at WTTG Fox 5 on Monday he was previously known to both Fox executives and police he had leveled threats against both previously DC police responded to the building on Wisconsin Avenue in the Friendship Heights neighborhood as officials say that the man had been shot in the station's Lobby by an armed security guard after forcing his way through the glass doors his name was George Odom's and he apparently started walking directly toward the decks desk station in the direction of the main part of the building at that point the security guard shot the guy he is in critical but stable condition it's apparently this guy has mental health issues but the problem is that we now live in a society in which we don't know who has mental health issues and who is being politically motivated and who has mental health issues and is being politically motivated we are living in an incredibly volatile time and that's unusual because the economy of the United States is thrumming along me Lord really well economically speaking were not in the middle of any major foreign crisis and yet we're at each other's throats politically and the bleeding edge of that fight is actually bleeding I mean the bleeding edge actually carries the possibility of serious violence heating up at the rhetoric on both sides is obviously not a worthwhile causing yet that seems to be happening Barack Obama who was one of the contributing factors to the breakdown in social fabric in the United States during his presidency he continued that crusade yesterday his campaigning in Nevada against Dean Heller who's the sitting senator and he just made clear that the sort of political polarization that he supposedly preaches against he's actually very much for here's President Obama back on the stump for the Democrats and he is saying that President Trump is a tin-pot dictator it is not a democratic or a Republican idea that we are not supposed to pressure the Attorney General or the FBI to use the criminal justice system to try to punish political opponents that's not how America works that's how some 10 pot dictatorship works that's not supposed to be America okay well here's the problem and this is really the problem with with President Obama you're gonna see this repeated throughout his little speech that he gave yesterday Nevada everything he accuses the right of doing he actually did while he was in office he says things like you're not supposed to influence the FBI you're not supposed to influence your Attorney General his own Attorney General Eric Holder called himself Barack Obama's wingman that was Eric Holder his own DOJ head calling himself the president's wingman the president is asserted executive privilege to protect Eric Holder from a Republican Congress over the Fast and Furious scandal so this is just nonsense and when the president says that you're not supposed to activate executive agencies to target political opponents that's exactly what his I arrested his IRS targeted conservative 501 C 3 s pro-israel 500 series the evidence was extraordinarily solid in that case the DOJ didn't do a serious investigation nor did they prosecute anybody so when the president says that President Trump is doing all the stuff when Obama says that Trump is doing all of this stuff just remember President Trump is a reaction to President Obama and the more you look at American history and history in general what you really do see is that the the the nature of the human being is to swing from side to side that we react to things that happen in our life and we usually overreact to things that happen in our life so we are react to President Bush by putting in President Obama then react but to President Obama by putting in President Trump that the pendulum in order for it to to start swinging less wildly it takes a force of collective will it takes all of us saying to each other we are not going to allow this pendulum to swing quite as wildly as it has been in the past if you look at the vacillations between the presidencies right now I would say that if you looked back in the 1960s like the difference between say LBJ and Richard Nixon on policy what you were looking at was a vet was a vacillation that was semi major but not enormous right the the the swing of the pendulum was not quite as far the same thing is true with Eisenhower and JFK the swing of the pendulum was not quite that far if you look at how far the pendulum is swinging now it's almost at 180 degrees and the pendulum is swinging wildly side-to-side and that's dangerous for the country because eventually the pendulum is going to swing over the bar and things are gonna get really insane President Obama did not help that this this revisionist history where President Obama was a great peace Springer this is this this revisionist history where President Obama did not create conflict inside the United States where he was a unifying figure as opposed to a polarizing figure that is just a lie when he was elected maybe he was a unifying figure for five minutes and then he proceeded to govern as an extraordinarily far left guy and then he also proceeded to polarize the country along ethnic racial and sexual lines it's a real it's just it's obvious that he's doing this he trolled the right into insanity and now President Trump is trolling the left into insanity this is all reactionary stuff here's President Obama again he's such a troll he's such a troll when people accuse President Trump of being a troll I'd like to remind folks the first presidential troll was Barack Obama here's President Obama trolling people in Nevada yesterday saying that he was very committed to the truth as presidents of the United States just one simple fact this is a fact this is not I'm just unlike some I actually try to state facts I believe in facts I I believe in a fact-based reality and in fact base politics okay that is just a lie he did not believe in a fact-based reality of fact-based politics it's just not true and he says that he didn't lie hidden like to fib like some people really how about if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor how about if the president the president doesn't have authority to grants executive amnesty how about those men died in Benghazi because of a YouTube video how about the Iran deal is being pursued because of a new moderate policy pushed by the new Iranian moderate administration the president lied every five seconds Barack Obama was a congenital liar while he was in office and he was replaced by a guy who doesn't have tremendous regard for the truth either again reaction and American politics is is almost completely proportionate Barack Obama was very far to the left and Donald Trump is his funhouse mirror image and when and when Barack Obama says things like he tries to state facts and Donald Trump just goes out there and he lies all the time it's just not sure I like when he says that he's based on that he's based in fact this is a President of the United States who took title mine of the Civil Rights Act which said you're not allowed to discriminate against women and tried to apply that to men who believe they are women saying that this was somehow fact-based almost nothing that Barack Obama did was fact-based almost nothing he did was fact-based and this is why so many people reacted to Barack Obama they said listen if facts don't matter the left well maybe they don't matter to us either all that matters now is victory because that was the mentality of the left the mentality of the left was that slandering george w bush as a war criminal was fully justified in order to get barack obama elected that slandering john mccain as george w bush part three was totally fine so long as it got barack obama elected but slandering mitt romney as a dog killing evil genius who gave women cancer specifically so that he could fire their husbands right that that was totally fine so long as he won that harry reid was fine and saying that mit romney didn't pay his taxes because after all they won this stuff does not spring from nowhere in American politics hey evil and American politics the the nastiness of American politics did not spring out of the ground full-blown like thena out of Zeus's head that's not the way this works Barack Obama was the progenitor of Donald Trump Barack Obama was the was the predictable forbear of Donald Trump in retrospect a second we're gonna give you some more of Barack Obama's propaganda and the fact that the left doesn't even acknowledge any of this is one of the reasons why the right continues to act the way the right is acting we'll get to more of that in just a second first I want to talk about what you are doing for the sheets in your bed okay the fact is that when you think about your sleep quality you rarely think about your sheets you think okay well I can just go down to the local Bed Bath and Beyond I can pick up the cheapest set of sheets they've got and it will be perfectly adequate wrong that you are that is not the way this works you need supremely comfortable sheets and the best sheets you can buy the best sheets on the market our bull and branch everything bull and branch makes from bedding to blankets is made from pure 100% organic cotton it means it starts out super soft they get even softer over time you can buy directly from them so you're essentially paying wholesale prices luxury sheets can cost up to a thousand dollars in the store but when branch sheets are only a couple of hundred bucks everyone who tries Boleyn branch sheets loves them that's why they have thousands of five-star reviews even three u.s. presidents sleep on bull and branch sheets shipping is free you can try them for 30 nights if you don't love them send them back for a refund you're not gonna want to send them back they are that comfortable to get you started right now my listeners get 50 bucks off your first set of sheets at bull and branch calm promo code Ben bull and branch calm promo code Ben for 50 bucks off your first set of sheets these sheets are so comfortable actually tossed out all of our other sheets we only own Boland branch now that's how good they are Bo LLM branch calm promo code Ben used that promo code bed to get fifty bucks off so Barack Obama is a great reminder as to why Donald Trump is president and then he tried to take credit in Nevada last night for the way the economy is growing now let's be clear the stock market did climb under Barack Obama because it fell to all-time lows under Barack Obama also now you'll recall that the economy collapsed in late 2008 right before the election that wasn't on Obama and then it continued to collapse until early 2009 and then it started to recover and then we had the slowest peacetime recovery in American history yeah I'm old enough to remember when folks were saying things like a 4% GDP growth rate is no longer possible for the United States and now we have had that for a couple of quarters in a row I'm old enough to remember when people said that the manufacturing sector in the United States was doomed to failure that obviously is not true when folks were the stock market was gonna top out where Obama left it that obviously was not true the job creation was going to top out that obviously was not true there's no question the economy is growing faster under Donald Trump than it was under Barack Obama it is superheated under Donald Trump in a way that it was not under Barack Obama again very very slow recovery under Obama and whatever recovery is due to Obama you really can only attribute for the first couple of years because after that it was the Republicans stymieing every budget that Obama tried to propose Obama passed one budget in eight years Republicans rejected every budget proposal Barack Obama ever made and yet here is Barack Obama saying that if anybody gets credit for the economy it's him now listen I'm never a fan of crediting the president with the economy I just don't I think the economy is too complicated for that I usually think that it has more to do with a predictable policy emanating from the halls of Congress the fact is that since Republicans were elected in 2010 we've had a consistent rate of growth in the United States economy accelerating when they didn't have to battle it out with Barack Obama over regulatory policy if you actually want to attribute economic growth to ending one body give the credit to Paul Ryan Mitch McConnell and all the other Republicans who have been instrumental in the formation of policy under Obama and under Trump but here's Barack Obama trying to take credit for himself we got the economy rolling again we started the longest streak of job creation on record we covered another twenty million people on health insurance we brought housing back here in Nevada we cut our deficits by more than half partly by making sure the wealthiest Americans folks like me paid their fair share of taxes okay we did not cut the deficit in half let's stop it right there when he says we cut the deficit in half what he means by that is that he blew out the deficit in his first year and then the deficit numbers went down the next couple of years and the reason that that is cutting in half it's like saying you know what I did last month last month I went $10,000 over my credit card bill this month I went $5,000 over my credit card bill I just cut my deficit in half that's what he's talking about that's I'm cutting your deficit in half I mean technically it's sort of his but not really considering that you're still blowing out the spending but again Barack Obama was the was the creator of the Trump phenomenon for the left who refused to acknowledge this putting them out on the campaign Trell it's such a mistake but this is the thing the Democrats really don't have a lot to offer at this point and so they are doubling down on on stupid the only person who seems to be discovering anything new ironically is Hillary Clinton and discuss that in just a second so Hillary Clinton when one of the things I do love about the Trump era is that the left suddenly realizes that when the levers of power are given to the other party things don't wind up great for the left so the left is all in favor of federal power as long as it's Barack Obama in charge when it's President Trump in charge suddenly they discover federal power is bad now I'm pretty consistent on this I think federal power sucks all the way through I think the first rule of good governance is don't create a weapon that can then be wielded by the other side folks on the Left have for gun control you know and I'm for I'm for federal power control he reduced the amount of federal power available to anyone and then you are not going to have to worry about the federal power being used against you one of the great ironies though is that Hillary Clinton one of the great advocates of federal power of the modern era she is now discovering federalism again amazing how this works Donald Trump comes along suddenly Hillary Clinton and the left are discovering that states are kind of great here's what she tweeted yesterday in reality of a Supreme Court with a right-wing majority is that the states are a new important front in protecting civil rights especially the rights of the most vulnerable among us is that really a new important front and protecting civil rights or does it turn out that the states were always an important front in protecting civil rights now folks are gonna say well think about the fact that the states were responsible for Jim Crow that's true it was also states that were responsible for failing to abide by the Fugitive Slave Act and then 1850s leading to the Civil War the federal government was trying to force states in the north to abide by the Fugitive Slave Act states in the North were refusing to abide by the Fugitive Slave Act states are only as good as the people who comprise them and their policy is only as good as the people who comprise them but one thing that is certainly true is that the United States as a mixed state and and national system as it is put in Federalist 39 as a mixed system state governments are designed to preserve the centrality of locality in American jurisprudence and the fact that the left is only now realizing this as soon as somebody who's in office they don't like is that the head of the federal governor demonstrates just how dishonest they are because here's the thing Hillary Clinton and her ilk if they ever got in charge again how long do you think they'd stick by the states rights proposal how long do you think they'd be in favor of states rights the answer is five seconds five seconds right the left is just dishonest about all the stuff the same left that proclaims that Donald Trump is dishonest this is dishonest when Hillary Clinton says she likes states rights know what Hillary Clinton means is that she wants to use any obstacle to prevent President Trump from governing but she doesn't actually believe in states rights if she actually believed in the states rights then presumably she'd want a devolution of authority to the states from the federal government across the board including if she had been president we all know that that was never going to happen we all know that was never going to happen instead the truth is what Democrats really want is to copy the policies of the Scandinavian countries where people forget to tell you this but the policy in Scandinavian countries is not just a massive social welfare state is a massive social welfare state paid for by enormous unbelievably high taxes the taxes in places like Denmark and Norway fifty to sixty percent on everybody making more than fifty or sixty grand a year we're not talking about taxes on just the wealthy even folks on the left are not willing to be honest about what exactly it would take to pay for all the crap that they are talking about instead what they will do is they will just kick the can down the road so what exactly are they proposing so they're not really proposing federalism and they're not obviously proposing fact-based legislation the left is proposing spending a lot of money so now we are going to get in the 2020 primaries from the Democrats who can spend the most cash so we have Kamala Harris who's proposing giving every poor family 500 bucks based on nothing we really don't know where exactly this money is going to come from how this is going to spur the economy any of that stuff cory booker says well why do 500 why not do a hundred times 500 let's give everybody 50 grand so why not give it be 500 grand by the way why not five million why don't just helicopter pallets of cash over newark and we'll just drop pallets of cash i mean hopefully people get out of the way if not they'll be crushed by money and die happy that apparently is the idea from Cory Booker so according to Vox which is the repository of all things stupid that's not to say that everybody ad Vox is stupid there's some intelligent folks at Vauxhall though why they remain there is beyond me senator Cory Booker is introducing a bill aimed at closing the gap between rich and poor his idea is to give lower-income kids a sizeable nest egg nearly 50 grand in some cases that they could use for wealth building purchases like a down payment on a house or college tuition these opportunity accounts would theoretically make sure all children have significant assets when they enter adulthood rather than just those who grew up in wealthier homes well you know what this particular proposal relies on people to use money well you know what else relies on people to use money well basic reason and free markets so dropping cash on people without actually using that cash for good purposes is counterproductive we're gonna get to some more of the Democratic agenda the reason based Democratic agenda barack obama talks about in just one second first let's talk about your underwear so dudes fall is here and as you switch out your wardrobe don't neglect the undies now is a perfect time to upgrade or restock your drawers with all new fall colors and prints from Tommy John Tommy John obsesses over every little detail and stitch these proprietary fabrics that perform like nothing you've worn before as a result Tommy John's men's and women's underwear they support a no wedgie guarantee comfortable stay put waist bands and a range of fabrics that are luxuriously soft feather-light moisture wicking breathable and designed to move with you not against you that means no bunching no riding up Tommy John is so confident in their underwear if you don't love your first pair you get a full refund with their best pair you'll ever wear or it's free guarantee so you really don't have anything to lose that includes their new life changing women's underwear which are now fully back in stock hurry - Tommy John calm /ban right now get 20% off your first order the underwear fantastic I am wearing them right now I have many pairs of Tommy John underwear because they are so good that's Tommy John comm slash Ben for 20% off one of the great things about these underwear by the way is that no matter how many times you put them in the wash they still operate they don't fall apart at the drop of a hat go - Tommy John calm right now Tommy John / Ben for 20% off okay so the democratic fact-based agenda now revolves around Kamala Harris offering everybody 500 bucks and Cory Booker offering everybody 50,000 bucks paid for by huh okay here's here's what the American Opportunity accounts program would look like every child upon being born would be given an account see with $1000 every year through the tax code children would receive up to an additional $2,000 deposit depending on family income funds would sit in a low-risk account managed by Treasury with roughly 3% annual returns account holders may not access the money until they reach age 18 and the only allowable uses our education home ownership and retirement okay so in other words we are just going to basically buy a house and an education for you paid for by mm-hmm nobody really knows okay so that that's really great you know it's another way of doing this actually can say if usually want to help young people you know it's another way of doing this privatizing Social Security because that's basically what he's talking about here he's basically talking about taking people's retirement savings and putting them in an account for them a lockbox for them for many many years and then giving them to them much later it's it's it all sounds great except for exactly how this this money is going to be generated and folks home left never talked about how the money is generated they just talk about free money so part one of the Democrats new agenda is apparently according to Hillary Clinton federalism so congratulations to all of us that's been around for a couple hundred years now Democrats are discovering it part two is give people lots and lots of free money and part three is hating science because the part three is science is stupid and we don't need it anymore so yesterday we talked at length about this new proposal from the Trump administration to define sex as you know the dictionary definition of sex like there are males and females and we talked about the left weird attempt to separate gender from sex and then to retro actively conflate sex and gender they're exactly the same thing and they're really pushing this hard now there's a person named Jennifer Finney Boylan who is a genetic male which is to say a male human and has had a bunch of surgeries and now considers himself female the the piece in the new york times is called trump cannot define away my existence and this is so weird this I love this argument from the left you can't define away my existence you literally define away the existence of millions of unborn children every single year they don't exist according to you now transgender people exist according to me but that does not mean that they are actually members of the sex to which they claim membership right I can I can fully acknowledge the people who suffer from mental from a mental disorder known as gender identity disorder or gender dysphoria those people exist of course they exist I mean they're there I know some of them like okay that's not the same thing as saying that you are actually a woman if you say that you are a woman and again there's no objective evidence there's no objective test I can use to determine that you are a woman if you say that you are a woman but here is the piece in the New York Times the anti-science piece of the New Democratic agenda feelings over fact here is this piece by Jennifer Finney Boylan I was surprised to learn on Sunday morning that I do not exist well that's weird she says this will come as sad news to my children to whom I've been a mother for over 20 years now well presumably you were a father at one point to your children and will come as a shock to my wife - to whom I've been married for 30 years it would have been a disappointment for my mother as well the conservative evangelical Christian Republican who when she learned I was transgender two decades ago said I would never turn my back on my child and then quote in first Corinthians these three remain Faith Hope and love but the greatest of these is love okay that's that's fine but it also says in the Bible that male and female he created them so I mean if we're gonna selectively quote the Bible you may as well quote the whole thing there's been a hard life for me these last 60 years but on the whole I felt grateful for the many blessings that have come my way and being trans not least it is so disappointing then and more than a little embarrassing to learn I'm imaginary a creature no more real than a cyclops or a Hippogriff again you're real human but you're not a real woman you know why because you are not genetically a real woman now you want to say that you are a gender that you're gendered feminine that you are a male who had surgeries to look more female and that you carry feminine attributes that is accurate that is accurate use of language it is not accurate use of language to say that you are a female on Sunday news broke that the Trump administration seeks to narrowly define gender as an immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth well actually they were defining sex that way and then you guys conflate sex and gender so you say it's the same thing I admit I'm reluctant to react to this latest cruelty which is obviously just one more cynical move clearly designed to stir the pot ahead of the election trans people are the latest conservative whipping girl like african-americans in the 1950s or gay people in the 1990s and 2000's nope nope gay people can objectively claim to be attracted to members of the same sex that's a subjective claim there is no way to objectively verify that so that is what it is I can objectively verify your sex for a variety of measures hey and black people a white person who claims that they're a black person is not in fact a black person as Rachel Dolezal learned I was speaking at the F scott Fitzgerald festival in Rockville Maryland this weekend when I first read about the administration's intense since then I've thought about a lot about Nick Carraway in the Great Gatsby and then this this continues instead the actual world contains all sorts of wonderful variations of nature look there are two cans and puffins there's a duckbill platypus in a blue lobster the Venus flytrap isn't in a miracle that God has given us all these wonderful things surely if there is room in this world for these there should be room in this world for me there again nobody is suggesting that transgender people should be mistreated but you do not get to tell the entire civilization to redefine biological sex on the basis of anti science positions because how you feel on the inside my favorite part of this piece is the suggestion that science is on the side of this policy there is no science on the side of the policy promulgated by the left that sex does not exist so they started off with sex exists but gender is unconnected with sex and then they went to gender exists but it exists on a spectrum then they went to sex exists again but it only exists on a spectrum expect a sex didn't exist for a while now it exists again but it only exists on a spectrum there's a spectrum of sex there's no spectrum of sex human beings are sexually dimorphic okay if you if you want to suggest that there are other species where sex can change fine but you are not you're not a fish you're not one of these fish that changes sex hey you are a human among humans sex does not change that's not the way this works but this has been pushed by the hard left and so you get the odd spectacle of Stephen Colbert tutting Trump tunning President Trump on this trans issue and how telling is the remark that he's about to make it's pretty telling I'll explain why in a second the Trump administration is thinking about writing new guidelines that say gender should be defined quote on a biological basis that is clear grounded in science oh now you care about science and listen to the crowd cheer that now you kept shouldn't you be happy that they care about science I'm confused so you say the when it comes to climate change that the Trump administration is utterly anti-scientific when it comes to the EPA they're utterly anti-scientific and that's bad but now they care about science when it comes to biological sex and that's bad does he even see the hypocrisy and what he's saying himself the answer is no because to the left even science is malleable now my position on climate change I've made clear multiple times on this program I did like an entire program on it a couple of weeks ago talking about the new IPCC report the world is warming it's warming at a slower rate than the scientists said it was going to according to their modeling probably a majority of that warming according to every scientist I've ever seen including Roy Spencer who is the Wrights favorite climate scientist suggests that the majority of that warming is due to human action that does not dictate global governance of the climate nor does it dictate that we have to crush capitalism in spirit or in action but that is considered an anti scientific position by the left it is considered a and it is considered I guess bad form to mention science when it comes to biological sex now if this is the new democratic position good luck with this guy's good luck ok so in just a second we'll talk about some other democratic positions and why the news cycle continues to cut in favor of the President of the United

in the nation so how stupid is the left agenda with regard to the anti science nonsense pushed by the transgender movement this is an actual tweet from New York Times science the idea that a person's sex is determined by their Anatomy at birth is not true and we've known that it's not true for decades okay well realistically speaking I suppose that's not true in the only in the most only the most narrow sense it is determined by chromosomes right is determined by genetics and theoretically you could have some sort of birth malformation when you are born that leaves you bereft of the genitalia that match up with your actual genetics so I guess in the very narrowest sense it's true but the idea that that means that sex is on a spectrum among humans is just stupid I love this headline though Anatomy does not determine gender experts say right genetics determines gender I love this researchers who have studied gender issues and provided health care to people who do not fit the typical male-female pigeonholes the typical male-female pigeonholes is though they're just created by society said that the Trump administration's latest plan to define gender goes beyond the limits of scientific knowledge the idea that a person's sex is determined by their Anatomy at birth is not true and we've known that it is not true for decades as John says Joshua safer and endocrinologist and the executive director of the sister of the Center for transgender medicine and surgery of course at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York you want talk about a scientific stuff ok talk about whether there are beneficial effects to transgender surgeries over time ok there is not good evidence to suggest that the end effect over the course of decades is actually significantly superior to no surgery and yet this has become part of the transgender movement stick now let me be clear we live in a free country you want to go carve up your own genitals that's your problem right you can find a surgeon who's willing to do that for you go for it it's a free country but let's not pretend that the science is on the side of all of the claims that are being made I love this they buried down in this article they say genetics does play a role though oh you think oh you think so it's it's by the way you know how you know that it's not just genitalia because of a male were to have his twig and berries physically removed in some sort of accident he would still be a male and if he intends to do so in a surgery we are now supposed to consider him a female ok that is it that is not logical I want to talk for just a second about the sort of propaganda that's been promoted on this issue and it really is insane propaganda so the the notion that is pushed by the left that transgenderism is not a mental disorder is completely a scientific hey now what the left does is they'd like to cite things like the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual because the dsm-5 suggests that gender identity disorder is no longer a mental disorder instead what the dsm-5 says is that a mental disorder is a quote syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition emotion regulation or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological biological or developmental processes underlying mental functioning now this is the this is the the funny part socially deviant behavior and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict results from a dysfunction in the individuals described above so in other words if you have something that makes you think that a pink elephant is stalking you unless this makes you feel bad this is not actually a mental disorder according to the DSM the definition makes room for its making clear room for politically correct posturing right if I am having a significant problem in and of myself all I have to do is blame it on society's intolerance and it is no longer considered a mental disorder okay so if you are suicidal because you're a man who believes he's a woman the DSM can still find a way to blame that on society all you have to say is the reason I'm suicidal is because people are mean to me in society not because I've suffered with this terrible conflict inside my inside my brain for my entire life right now society's fault this is how the dsm-5 avoids the obvious implication that if you're man who believes you're woman you have a mental disorder if you're by the way if you are a fat person who believes you are skinny or a skinny person who believes you are fat we all acknowledge you of a mental disorder if you are a skinny person who believes you're a fat it's called anorexia it's dangerous and it's a mental disorder if you are a person who believes that you do not need a left arm right this is something called body dysmorphia this is a mental disorder but if you're a man who believes you're a woman and you don't need your penis then it's not a mental disorder it's society's fault you explain that one to me ain't none of this has anything to do with science and all of it is specifically designed to blame society for what is clearly and obviously a mental disorder the reason that I'm serious about calling it a mental disorder the reason I do so is because you and actually treat a mental disorder by blending in on society if you want to come up with new treatments for mental disorder the way to do that is not by saying that society at large is responsible for the discomfort of people suffering from the mental disorder I'm somebody who takes mental illness extraordinarily seriously my grandfather was either bipolar or schizophrenic there are some lines that are that are hard to sort of diagnose there he was institutionalized when my dad was a child he thought the radio was talking to him he thought the curtains were trying to strangle him he suffered from that that was not something where if we had blamed society's intolerance and just said you know what Nate the radio actually is talking to you as your society can't hear what you hear that would have been foolish they gave him a lithium and he was much better that does not mean there's a good treatment for gender identity disorder gender dysphoria but to pretend that the treatments are all available and that transitioning is the only available sort of fix and that everything else is society's fault is anti-scientific in the extreme and to quote the DSM which is a political football and has been a political football for decades as the sort of apotheosis of scientific knowledge is just silly it's just silly they're definitely the definition of mental disorder itself is not scientific according to the dsm-5 it is that there's no way that you can pose a hypothesis and then debunk it it is not scientifically verifiable okay with all of that said the left has embraced a bunch of positions that are unsustainable I believe in American politics the the latest position they are embracing that is unsustainable in American politics has to do with this migrant caravan so this migrant caravan as we mentioned yesterday is now approaching the American border with presumably the help of the Mexican government you can see the Mexican authorities are driving alongside the caravan it is now ten thousand people large and it is moving toward the border now there are processes for asylum in the United States all you have to do is go to a US Embassy and apply or you can go to a border checkpoint and apply you can see the pictures if you're if you're able to watch this because you subscribe it daily we're calm you can see the pictures I mean these are these are marches stretching a mile long ten wide there's an enormous enormous number of people well President Trump he got himself into trouble yesterday because he said listen there's some bad people who are coming in this in this care right now are there bad people coming in the caravan who the hell knows the answer is we don't know the answer to that I presumably some those people are bad presumably many of those people are not bad but the answer is we don't know who they are so how can we possibly open our borders in this way what's happening right now as a large group of people the court a caravan and in that Caravan you have some very bad people you have some very bad people and we can't let that happen to our country ok so you know he's maybe right maybe he's wrong but we don't know now what the left proclaims that we should let all of these people in presumably but then why not let in the next Caravan or all caravans does everyone who wants to come to the United States because they're coming from a bad situation have the right to come into the United States now I am pretty libertarian when it comes to people who are immigrating for employment reasons this is why I think that we ought to let in more people through legal immigration methods in the United States but let's recognize something the social structure of the United States is not the same in 2018 as it was in 1907 the reason I use 1907 is that's when my ancestors got here the comparison here is not between the ethnicities of the folks showing up I don't care about ethnicity I really don't it makes no difference to me the question is what is the social system that people are being integrated into when my great-great grandparents got to the United States when they got here in 1907 and they arrived on the boats they spoke Yiddish and had no money and there was no social safety net they were immediately thrust into a capitalist economy where they had to learn English and they had that they were forced by circumstance into assimilating specifically so they could operate in the economy of the United States and become good American citizens there were people who left stuff behind in their home country to come to the United States so that they could actually live a better more adventurous life now I think a lot of immigrants still want that but the fact that we have a social safety net that picks up after everybody the fact that if you have a baby in the United States that baby is now an American citizen and you can take advantage of all of the benefits of American citizenship that there are all these you know tremendous social safety nets available to you means we have to be a little bit more circumspect about who we let in the country and again citing the Scandinavian countries the Scandinavian countries are really tough on immigration they're very tough on immigration and they should be because the richer your social safety net the more folks are going to want to take advantage of it and let's not pretend that there is no anti-american animus in this met in his Caravan there clearly is you can look at some of the pictures alright so some of the folks who are who are marching we're carrying the Honduran flag so this one I believe is actually from Honduras and so let's go back to the hundred flag one so you can see at the front of this March there are people who are carrying the Honduran flag now the claim of the caravan is that these are people who are attempting to escape from Honduras Honduras is a bad place right it's a place where they can't live the life they want to live it's a place of little Economic Opportunity so why are you carrying the flag of that place when Cuban refugees got on to nineteen fifty Chevy's inflated the tires and tried to float their way to Florida they weren't carrying a Cuban flag when they arrived on American shores they were trying to escape Cuba that was sort of the point if you're marching from Honduras to escape Honduras why are you coming here with a Honduran flag when my ancestors got here they weren't carrying a Russian or Lithuanian flag they they came to the United States ready to carry an American flag that is the point this idea that you can assimilate all cultures including people who forcibly do not want to be assimilated in a social safety net society is just not accurate and yet that's what Democrats continue to promote I mean over in Honduras by the way in support of the migrants they've been burning American flags at some of these protests this is a famous picture going around yesterday somebody painted a swastika on the American flag and then burned it so then why do folks who want in America's Nazi Germany is not really a great pitch as to I also want to enter there you know that that push again it leads folks to the position that President Trump has taken where he says he's a nationalist not a globalist now President Trump said this in a rally yesterday that he's a nationalist not a globalist I've distinguished between nationalism and patriotism I'm not a big nationalist in the sense that I don't think that simple borders and living in the same place is enough of a rationale for you to be enthused I think that instead you actually have to be about ideas but what he's reacting to is the left's focus on globalism the left belief that there should be no borders that people should be able to cross willy-nilly in to the United States and never assimilate because multiculturalism is the way to go you want to know why President Trump is popular it's because of this is a person that wants the globe to do well frankly not caring about our country so much and you know what we can't have that you know they have a word it sort of became old-fashioned it's called a nationalist and I say really we're not supposed to use that word you know what I am I'm a nationalist okay okay the reason that you're not supposed to use the word nationalist typically is because it's largely been connected with repressive regimes who are focused in on commonalities in ethnicity and culture as opposed to commonalities and ideas but if she is posing sort of American interests against folks who want inundation of our borders then that's perfectly rational that's perfectly rational okay so it's time for a up to some things I like and things I hate is that we're okay so let's do some things that I like in some things that I hate so things that I like today there's a book that was recommended to me by Andrew Clavin I've been I've been going through kind of Drew's reading list it's called the Last Supper by Charles Meharry and it's a really good sort of action thriller dating all the way back it's it turned a Cold War thriller that dates all the way back to the 1920s and then carries forward through the Vietnam War it's really worth the read it's really well written and I'm sort of a devotee of action thrillers at least old-fashioned ones I'm one of my favorite books of the day of the jackal by Frederick Forsyth which is the best action thriller in the history of literature it's so good but this one is quite good too Charles Mackerras the Last Supper worth a read go check it out that's that's worth checking out okay other things that I like today I do enjoy PETA the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals because they're totally crazy so I I do enjoy them here is what they tweeted out yesterday cow's milk has long been a symbol used by white supremacists one more reason to hashtag ditch dairy really didn't know that was a thing so apparently I knew is it thing only because the New York Times we talked about a piece earlier this week in which white supremacist were guzzling cow's milk to demonstrate their genetic superiority because they could tolerate lactose which again seems like not the world's most important skill set like you can't really put on your resume tolerates lactose well that's not something that like if somebody put that on the rez pay for the daily wear be like this person is not getting hired but but Peter's response is just as stupid which is not why should cow's milk be used by white supremacists it's cow's milk itself is indeed white supremacists so you should not use cow's milk anymore goat's milk apparently not white supremacists so that's good to know so I guess forcible milking of the goats is on its way and also what do you do if you like chocolate milk maybe like chocolate milk are you also white supremacists further questions my children big fans of milk really enjoy it did ever since they were babies it turns out where they weight supremacist when they were small babies his babies like cow's milk true true story so PETA doing yeoman's work in demonstrating just how insane they are each and every day of the week well done well done PETA okay time for a couple of things that I hate a thing number one that I hate a new study 25% of students say they were traumatized by the 2016 election researchers surveyed Arizona State University students around the time of president Trump's inauguration in 2017 some had stress scores on par with that of seven month follow-ups to school shooting witnesses 25% of the 769 students reported clinically significant levels of stress women black Hispanic non-christian students reported higher stress so apparently they now say that they are suffering basically from post-traumatic stress disorder not kidding this is the this is this is actually what they're saying so they're saying they suffer from PTSD a quarter of these students they found it so traumatic they now report symptoms of PTSD according to the study so things that cause PTSD for young people in the past 1910s World War one trench warfare 1920s aftermath of World War one in trench warfare 1930s the Great Depression and mass starvation 1940s World War two the 1960s the Vietnam War the 1970s vast social unrest bombings in the United States 2018 you lost an election oh you pansies i prescribed to you avec takes my avocado toast and call me in the morning they really PTSD PTSD from an election listen when John Kerry was poised to win in 2004 I was living in Cambridge Massachusetts because going to Harvard Law at the time and well I was and while I was there John Kerry was supposed to speak just down the road the entire town was abuzz because John Kerry was gonna be the next president I went to Tower Records which used to exist it used to be a place kids and Tower Records is a place where they sold this thing called CDs and CDs were these things that had music on them and you played them so I went over to Tower Records in in Harvard Square and I bought myself Mozart's Requiem and prepared for a deep depressing evening as it turns out the 2004 election was great but I was prepared was that PTSD no it wasn't and come on it man up man up come the hell on if this is the generation we are reliant upon no no I think well I think we're all screwed I think it's fair to say we're screwed if if a quarter of all humans were a quarter of all students were given were stressed some level of PTSD yeah we're jacked the United States is over okay other things that I hate there's actually a thing that I like so Amy Schumer confirmed that she was pregnant and she tweeted out Chris she's married Chris and I are thrilled almost positive he's the father which is funny okay well just I'd like to make a quick point I am extraordinarily excited and happy that Amy Schumer has a meaningless cluster of cells in her womb could not be happier for her about this meaningless cluster of cells in her womb now do I believe it's meaningless cluster it's also of course not that's the point I think it's a baby which is why it makes sense for me to be happy when people are pregnant what makes less sense is the idea that I can be happy about this meaningless cluster of cells in my womb if it's me but if it's somebody else I have no way to be happy for them because what do they think maybe maybe they think it's a meaningless cluster of cells presumably if Amy Schumer wanted to abort this cluster of cells it would just be a cluster of cells the same people who say that we are erasing transgender people by saying transgender people exist but are not members of the opposite sex which is biologically true say that babies don't exist because they are meaningless clusters of cells embryos are just meaningless clusters of cells which is both anti-scientific and erasing human beings so there's that okay you know what that's enough for today I'm ready to leave so we're gonna we're gonna do another show tomorrow we will be back here then I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Senya Villarreal executive producer Jeremy boring senior
