MATT: AND A LIKE REPORT FROM
JACKSON HOLE WITH PETER HENRY.
OLIVER: AND CHINA'S MYSTERIOUS
TOURISM NUMBERS.
HOW THE CHANGES ARE IMPACTING
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, ESPECIALLY
EUROPE.
>> WE BEGIN WITH OUR MARKET
MINUTES AFTER MORE THAN A MOST
TOO MUCH ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE
NEXT RATE MOVE.
JANET YELLEN SPOKE TODAY AND
U.S. STOCKS CLOSED MIXED.
THE S&P ENDEMOL CLOSING LOWER
FOR THE SECOND STRAIGHT DAY.
HEALTH CARE WAS THE BEST
PERFORMER.
THE NASDAQ FINISHED JUST IN THE
POSITIVE, VERILY.
OLIVER: THE NASDAQ HAS REMAINED
SOMEWHAT BOY IT AFTER THE PAST
COUPLE WEEKS.
LOOKING DEEPER IN THE STOCK
MARKET, I WON A LOOK AT A COUPLE
OF THOSE SECTORS YOU MENTIONED.
UTILITIES NOT DOING SO WELL.
THAT HAS BEEN PART OF THE MARKET
HURTING QUITE A BIT.
MATT: THAT REMINDS ME OF THE
DEATH OF THE SAFETY TRADE.
AND THE BIRTH OF THIS
CONVERSATION THAT WILL KEEP
HAPPENING.
FINANCIALS HELD UP A BIT
POSSIBLY DUE TO THE FACT WE ARE
GETTING MORE HAWKISH.
BIGGER MOVES.
NOT A HUGE MOVE ON THE WEEK BUT
HE WAS LOOKING AT THE SAME KIND
OF REVERSAL OF THE TREND IN
WHICH FINANCIALS ARE STAYING IN
THE GREEN.
ENERGY GETTING HIT.
COMMODITIES NOT GETTING HIT.
UTILITIES DOWN 3.2% ON THE WEEK.
EVENTUALLY FLAT AFTER FISHER
CAME AND MUDDLED THAT MESSAGE A
BIT.
OLIVER: SAINT -- A THREE-DAY
CHART HERE ON MY TERMINAL.
YOU CAN SEE I PUT A LINE AT THE
CLOSE OF DAY TWO.
DAY TWO WAS ONE CARSON BLOCK
CAME ON BLOOMBERG TELEVISION
EXCLUSIVELY AND TOLD THE WORLD
OF HIS SHORT TRADE ON SAINT JUDE
AND WE SPOKE WITH THE SECURITIES
FIRM THAT HE TEAMED UP WITH IN
ORDER TO FIND THE
VULNERABILITIES THEY CLAIM, THEY
ALLEGE ARE PRESENT IN ST. JUDE
MEDICAL GEAR.
YOU CAN SEE ON DAY THREE OF THIS
THREE-DAY CHART THAT THE SHARES
HAVE NOW COMPLETELY RECOVERED
THEIR THIRD DAY LOSSES AS SAINT
JUDE COMES OUT AND ESSENTIALLY
DENIES SOME OF THE CLAIMS CARSON
BLOCK MADE.
SCARLET: LET'S CHECK THE BOND
MARKET.
THE TWO YEAR YIELD WAS
PARTICULARLY NOTICEABLE BECAUSE
THE POSSIBILITY OF A RATE HIKE
SENT BONDS TUMBLING.
PRICES DROPPED, WHICH MEANS
YIELDS GO UP AND THAT IS WHAT
HAPPENED THERE TO 84 BASIS
POINTS.
THAT IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE
JUNE AND FUTURE RATE INCREASES
WILL BE GRADUAL.
YOU SEE THAT THE LONGER END OF
THE YIELD CURVE.
THE OVERALL RESULT IS A FLATTER
YIELD CURVE.
OLIVER: I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT
SOME OF THE CURRENCIES THAT HAVE
MOVED TODAY.
YOU SAW SOME DOLLAR WEAKNESS.
TAKE A LOOK AT THE POUND.
TAKE A LOOK AT THE YEN OR THIS
SCREEN.
I HAVE GOT THE DOLLAR RISING.
YOU CAN SEE THE INITIAL DROP
WITH THE RED ARROW AND
EVENTUALLY THE DOLLAR CLIMBING
THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON.
IF YOU DO LOOK AT ANY OF THOSE
CURRENCIES, PRETTY MUCH ANY
CURRENCY YOU WILL SEE A STRONGER
DOLLAR BECAUSE I THINK ONLY THE
ONE AND ONE OTHER SMALL
CURRENCY.
I WILL PULL IT UP.
THEN WE CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT
HAPPENED WITH CURRENCIES.
I WILL PUT EXPANDED MAJORS HERE
RATHER THAN JUST THE MAJORS AND
YOU CAN SEE THAT THE INDONESIAN
RUPEE.
SCARLET: NICE WORK.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT COMMODITIES
AS WELL.
OIL CLIMBED BUT DID GIVE BACK
MOST OF ITS GAINS.
LITTLE CHANGE IN COPPER AND
GOLD.
THINK RIGHTLY TO A 15 MONTH HIGH
IN LONDON.
IT HAS THE BEST-PERFORMING
COMMODITY IN LONDON THIS YEAR.
SIGNS OF A SHORTAGE WITH DEMAND
HOLDING UP.
THOSE ARE TODAY'S MARKET
MINUTES.
NOW LET'S TAKE A DEEP DIVE INTO
THE BLOOMBERG.
YOU CAN FIND ALL THE FOLLOWING
CHART AT THE FUNCTION AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN.
I WANTED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE
FUNCTION THAT ALLOWS US TO CHECK
OUT TRADERS PARTICIPATING --
ANTICIPATING RATE INCREASES.
THE ODDS FOR A RATE HIKE 42% FOR
SEPTEMBER, 50% FOR NOVEMBER, AND
60% FOR DECEMBER.
IF YOU GO BACK TO YESTERDAY
BEFORE JANET YELLEN SPOKE, IT
WAS AT 32% YESTERDAY AND 54%.
YOU CAN SEE THE ODDS WERE MUCH
LOWER THERE.
IN DECEMBER, 42%.
OLIVER: A BIT OF A CHANGE BUT
NOTHING HUGE.
NO VASTER REPRICING.
MATT: I -- NO VAST REPRICING.
SCARLET: MAXIMUM OPTION ANALOGY.
MATT: THAT IS NOT REALLY
EXCITING FOR US OR THE MARKET.
THE PROBLEM IS $6 TRILLION WORTH
OF BOND MANAGERS ARE REALLY
FRUSTRATED BY THE DIRECTION OR
LACK THERE OF FROM THE FED.
SCARLET: MIKE JUST MESSAGED ME
SAYING THAT YOU REALLY NEED THE
ODDS TO GO OUT TO 70% FOR A GOOD
CHANCE OF FOLLOW-THROUGH.
THEY WANT TO GET TO 50%.
MATT: I HAVE A CHART I'M SURE
YOU HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF TIMES
BUT IT SHOWS CORPORATE PROFITS.
WE ARE IN THE LONGEST SLUMP
RIGHT NOW SINCE THE END OF THE
RECESSION IN MID-2009.
BROKEN DOWN BY QUARTERS, IT
SHOWS YOU HOW BAD IT HAS BEEN.
THE LAST TIME WE SAW A SLUMP
LIKE THIS ENDED IN THE SECOND
QUARTER OF 2009.
BEFORE YOU SEE GDP START TO TURN
AROUND, YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS
TAKE UP.
YOU WILL NOT SEE THE STRONG GDP
PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU IS
NECESSARY FOR NORMALIZATION OF
INTEREST RATES.
A 3.5% LEVEL OF GROWTH IS WHAT
WE HEARD TODAY.
FROM ECONOMISTS AND -- WHO WAS
IT THAT CAME ON AND SAID 3.5%?
SCARLET: O'LEARY.
MATT: KEVIN O'LEARY WAS TELLING
US.
HE IS WATCHING IT VERY CLOSELY.
OLIVER: ANOTHER RED BAR THERE
THAT USED TO BE GREEN.
BARELY IN THE RED NOW BUT STILL
SOME NEGATIVITY.
I WANT TO LOOK AT A POTENTIAL
EXPLANATION FOR WHY WE SOLD OFF
A BIT TODAY.
PART OF IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE
THERE WAS A POSITION WHERE THERE
WASN'T A LOT OF DIRECTION IN
WHICH THEY COULD GO.
FIRST WE LOOK AT THE MOVES ON A
YEARLY BASIS IN TERMS OF WHAT
HAPPENED FOR JACKSON HOLE
SPEECH.
GENERALLY WHEN THE FED CHAIR
COMES DOWN, STOCKS GO UP THE
NEXT WEEKEND AND IT'S LOOKING AT
A SENTIMENT GAUGE BY THE PANIC
INDEX.
BASICALLY THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS,
THAT PANIC GAUGE HAS JUMPED UP.
SHORT INTEREST HAS COME DOWN
HERE SO THE FACT THAT MAYBE THIS
IS SOME TYPE OF SELLING, JUST
ONE POSSIBLE EXPLANATION.
MATT: MIKE REGAN JOINS US NOW
WITH WRAPPING UP THE WEEK FOR US
IN TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT
HAPPENED AFTER JANET YELLEN
DIDN'T DISRUPT THE MARKET.
>> THE WEEK BOILS DOWN TO ONE
SPEECH WAITING ON THE EDGE OF
THEIR SEATS FOUR.
CHARLOTTE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE
WORLD INTEREST-RATE PROBABILITY
FUNCTION.
IT'S FASCINATING TO ME HOW A LOT
OF TRADERS ARE GLUED TO THAT
THING, REFRESHING IT EVERY DAY.
WHAT AMAZES ME IS HOW SWIFTLY
THAT THING CAN MOVE.
A 43% CHANCE OF INCREASE AS OF
TODAY.
IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT SIGNAL
THAT EVERYONE IS LOOKING AT THE
ONE OF THOSE BASED ON A
RELATIVELY SMALL MARKET.
NOT A HUGELY LIQUID MARKET ON A
RELATIVE BASIS COMPARED TO THE
STOCK MARKET.
THE TAKE AWAY FOR ME IS THAT IT
IS AN IMPORTANT SNAPSHOT THAT WE
CAN LOOK AT ANY TIME BUT IT'S A
SIGNAL WRITTEN IN PENCIL.
THAT IS THE IMPORTANT TAKE AWAY
FROM TODAY IS THAT THE ODDS LOOK
A LITTLE HIGHER BUT ANOTHER DATA
POINT, ANOTHER CONFLICTING
SPEECH COULD SEND IT THE OTHER
WAY.
I LIKE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT
THE SAFETY TRADE.
IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU
LOOK AT THESE GROUPS AS THE
SAFETY TRADE, DEFENSIVE
INDUSTRIES.
IT USED TO BE HEALTH CARE BUT
THAT HAS KIND OF AN DISMISSED
BECAUSE OF THE QUESTION OF
PRICING WITH THE ELECTION BUT IT
HAS REALLY BEEN NOT SO MUCH AS
SAFETY TRADING AS THIS DESPERATE
HUNT FOR YIELD TRAIT.
IT'S NOT LIKE UTILITY YIELDS ARE
HIGHER THAN THEY HAVE BEEN
TRADITIONALLY, JUST BOND LOWS --
YIELDS ARE SO LOW.
MATT: I HAVE THE ONE-MONTH GROUP
RETURNS HERE.
RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OVER THE
PAST 30 DAYS, UTILITIES, TELECOM
, AND THESE ARE THE TRADITIONAL
SAFETY GROUPS.
>> THAT ROTATION IS MORE
CYCLICAL.
OF COURSE ENERGY HAS A MIND OF
ITS OWN BUT FINANCIALS
ESPECIALLY, THE FINANCIAL INDEX
TODAY REACHING ITS HIGHEST LEVEL
OF THE YEAR AND A BROAD GROUP OF
COMPANIES BUT HEAVILY WEIGHTED
TO JPMORGAN, THE GROUPS THAT
STAND TO BENEFIT FROM HIGHER
RATES.
THE STOCK MARKET SEEMS TO BE
MORE CONFIDENT A RATE HIKE IS
COMING.
OLIVER: YOU CAN CUT ALL THE FAST
COMMENTARY ON THE BLOOMBERG
TERMINAL.
SCARLET: COMING UP, MORE LIVE
INTERVIEWS FROM JACKSON HOLE IN
WYOMING AND PETER HENRY WILL BE
SITTING DOWN WITH US.
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

MATT: THE STOCK MARKET OPTIMISM
WITH JANET YELLEN'S BULLISH
COMMENTS ON THE U.S. ECONOMY
FIZZLED AFTER THE FED VICE
CHAIRMAN SEVEN INTEREST-RATE
INCREASES POSSIBLE IN SEPTEMBER.
LET'S HEAD DR. JACKSON HOLE
WHERE MIKE IS STANDING BY WITH
HEATER HENRY, THE DEAN OF THE
NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS.
>> DEAN HENREY HAD THE CATBIRD
SEAT.
HOW WAS IT RECEIVED IN THE ROOM?
THESE ARE ACADEMICS AND FED
POLICY MAKERS WHO ARE LOOKING AT
THIS FROM A DIFFERENT
PERSPECTIVE.
LIKE I THINK EVERYONE IS TAKING
THE LONG-TERM VIEW.
PEOPLE WAITING FOR REVELATIONS
TO HIM FROM THE PODIUM I THINK
WERE DISAPPOINTED BUT THERE ARE
A FEW THAT SAY WE HAVE TO RESUME
MONETARY POLICY FOR THE NEXT
CRISIS, NOT THINKING ABOUT HOW
WE CHANGE IT FOR THE NEXT COUPLE
WEEKS OR MONTHS.
>> IS THERE A GENERAL CONSENSUS
THAT POLICY AS WE KNOW IT HAS
RUN ITS COURSE?
>> I THINK THERE'S A STRONG VIEW
THAT MONETARY POLICY HAS ON MOST
OF WHAT IT CAN ON ITS OWN TO
REALLY GENERATE RECOVERY.
BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS A
STRONG SENSE THAT WE ARE ALL
WAITING FOR THE FISCAL SIDE OF
THE HOUSE AND FOR LAWMAKERS TO
REALLY STEP UP AND DO WHAT MUST
BE DONE.
MONETARY POLICY HAS CREATED THE
CONDITIONS BUT WE HAVE SEEN A
REALLY CONTRACTIONARY FISCAL
POLICY.
WE ARE NOT SEEING POLICIES THAT
CAN REALLY DRIVE PRODUCTIVITY.
MUCH MORE NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO SEE
THE KIND OF ROBUST GROWTH WE ALL
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE.
>> IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND
POLICY MAKERS HAVE SHOWN NO
SIGNS OF COURAGE LATELY, DOES
MONETARY POLICY CONTINUE TO STEP
INTO THE BREACH AND DOES THAT
BECOME HARMFUL?
>> I THINK THERE'S A DANGER OF
OVERREACH.
I THINK YOU WILL SEE STRONG
EVIDENCE OF SOMEONE WHO IS AWARE
OF THE DANGERS OF OVERREACH.
CENTRAL BANKERS NEED TO BE
HUMBLE.
THEY WERE HEROES FOR A WHILE.
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE MONETARY
POLICY HAS RUN ITS COURSE.
>> IT IS REACTING TO THE NEXT
RECESSION.
IS THERE ANY CONFIDENCE, ANY
FEELING THAT PERHAPS CENTRAL
BANKS WILL COME INTO THE NEXT
CRISIS WITH LESS AMMUNITION?
>> THERE IS A SENSE, IF YOU
LISTENED TO THE CHAIRS A SPEECH
THIS MORNING, GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW
TODAY, THERE ARE REASONS TO
BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT ARSENAL
THAT THE FED HAS IS SUFFICIENT
TO DEAL WITH WHAT MAY COME.
FOR INSTANCE IF YOU LOOK AT
INTEREST RATES HISTORICALLY,
DURING THE TIMES THE ECONOMY HAS
GONE INTO RECESSION, IT TURNS
OUT THE STANCE OF MONETARY
POLICY HAS UNEXPECTEDLY BEEN
RELATIVELY TIGHT AT THE
BEGINNING OF HER SESSIONS,
MEANING THERE HAS BEEN A NEED
FOR BIGGER INTEREST-RATE MOVES
TO PROVIDE THE SLACK THE ECONOMY
NEEDED TO GET BACK ON TRACK.
EVEN THOUGH INTEREST RATES ARE
AT HISTORICAL LOWS, THERE MAY BE
MORE SLACK IN THE SYSTEM
PRESENTLY THAN IS FULLY
REALIZED.
>> IT WAS A MORNING OF THE
THEORIES ON THE TABLE AND HAVING
THEM DISCUSSED.
WHAT DREW YOU THE MOST INTEREST?
>> WHAT DREW THE MOST INTEREST
WAS THIS NOTION THAT THE NATURAL
RATE OF INTEREST IS AT AN
ALL-TIME HISTORICAL LOW.
IF WE THINK ABOUT WHAT IS THE
RATE OF RETURN TO CAPITAL AND
THAT REALLY DRIVES BOND YIELD IN
AN ECONOMY.
THE FACT THAT WE ARE AT ALL TIME
HISTORICAL LOWS MEANS THAT
FRANKLY THE MONETARY POLICY HAS
REACHED A POINT WHERE IT CAN NO
LONGER DO MUCH TO REALLY DRIVE
REAL INVESTMENT OVER THE
LONG-TERM.
THAT SUGGESTS WE NEED GREATER
OPENNESS TO TRADE, LOWER LABOR
FORCE GROWTH WE HAVE SEEN.
THAT POINTS TO IMMIGRATION.
LOTS OF WHAT WE CALL STRUCTURAL
FORMS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN TO
DRIVE PRODUCTIVITY, DRIVE UP THE
NATIONAL RATE OF INTEREST FOR
THE UNDERLYING RATE OF RETURN TO
REAL INVESTORS TO PROPEL GROWTH.
THE QUESTION IS WHICH LAWMAKERS
ARE READY TO ACTUALLY EMBRACE
THIS REALITY AND MAKE THE
CHANGES WE NEED?
>> THERE DOES SEEM TO BE GENERAL
AGREEMENT THAT ONE OF THE
BIGGEST PROBLEMS IS THE DECLINE
IN PRODUCTIVITY WE HAVE SEEN.
DID ANYBODY COME UP WITH A
THEORY FOR WHAT IS CAUSING IT
AND WHAT SHOULD BE DONE?
>> NO DEFINITIVE THEORY BUT TO
GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW SERIOUS
THE DECLINE IS, FROM 1946 TO
2005, AVERAGE PRODUCTIVITY
GROWTH WAS 2.5% PER YEAR.
SINCE 2006, 1.25%.
THAT IS SIGNIFICANT IF YOU
COMBINE IT WITH THE FACT THAT
LABOR FORCE GROWTH HAS ALSO
SLOWED.
HISTORICALLY, IT'S ABOUT 1% PER
YEAR AND IS DECLINING 2.5% PER
YEAR.
THOSE FACTORS TOGETHER
AUTOMATICALLY LOCK YOU INTO
LONG-TERM POTENTIAL GROWTH LESS
THAN 2%, WHICH IS FAR BELOW WHAT
WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST, CLOSER
TO 3%.
THAT IS A REAL CHALLENGE.
>> WHEN YOU'RE IN A CONFERENCE
LIKE THIS ALL DAY, YOU ARE
BASICALLY TALKING ABOUT
WORST-CASE SCENARIOS.
ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC, PESSIMISTIC?
>> I FEEL POSITIVE TO NEUTRAL.
I THINK THE FED HAS DONE AN
EXTRAORDINARY JOB OVER THE LAST
ALMOST DECADE NOW OF GRAPPLING
WITH A VERY SEVERE CRISIS,
PUTTING IN PLACE NEW TOOLS TO
HELP US DEAL WITH THAT CRISIS.
THERE IS STABILITY IN THE
ECONOMY.
WE ARE GROWING AGAIN.
BUT IT'S HARD TO BE OVERLY
OPTIMISTIC WHEN WE ARE GROWING
AT 2% AND WITH UNEMPLOYMENT DOWN
TO 5%, THERE'S STILL A REAL
CHANCE OF HAVING AN ECONOMY THAT
IS NOT PRODUCING THE KIND OF
INCOME GAINS THAT ARE EITHER
LARGE ENOUGH OR WIDELY
DISTRIBUTED ENOUGH TO REALLY
LIFT THE AVERAGE WORKING
AMERICAN FAMILY INTO A PLACE
THAT MAKES THEM FEEL CONFIDENT.
BECAUSE OF THAT, THERE IS THIS
REINFORCING FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE
EXPECTING LESS IN TERMS OF THEIR
INCOME, IN TERMS OF THEIR
ABILITY TO PUT THEIR KIDS
THROUGH SCHOOL.
SO THAT IS HAVING A DAMPENING
EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY TODAY.
SAME THING WITH BUSINESSES.
BUSINESSES ARE NOT INVESTING AS
MUCH AS BECAUSE THEY ARE
EXPECTING LESS.
LOWER EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE
FUTURE TRANSLATE INTO LOWER
EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE
TODAY.
>> THANK YOU.
WE WILL SEND ABOUT TO YOU IN NEW
YORK AND HOPEFULLY YOU CAN BE
OPTIMISTIC.

SCARLET: DIVERGING PATH AFTER
THE BREXIT VOTE.
THIS CHART HERE SHOWS HOW STOCKS
IN THE U K IN EUROPE TEND TO
MOVE IN LOCK STEP.
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHICH IS WHICH
UNTIL THE BREXIT VOTE.
SINCE THEN, IT HAS REALLY TAKEN
OFF.
WHAT HAS BEEN DRIVING THAT
OUTPERFORMANCE, THE POUNDS
WEAKNESS, WHICH HAS EUROPEAN
STOCKS FALLING.
THE HANDLE -- BOTTOM PANEL SHOWS
THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TWO

RIGHT NOW, IT'S AT THE LOWEST
LEVEL CORRELATION GOING BACK
MORE THAN A YEAR.
IT'S AN INTERESTING DIVERGENCE
TO KEEP TRACK OF, ESPECIALLY AS
EVERYONE IS LOOKING FOR DATA TO
BACK UP THE FACT THE BREXIT VOTE
WAS TERRIBLE FOR ALL OF THE
ECONOMIES.
MATT: THOSE ARE COMPANIES THAT
EXPORT A LOT SO WHEN YOU SEE A
BIG DROP IN THE POUND, THAT'S
BENEFICIAL TO THOSE COMPANIES
THAT WILL LOOK DIFFERENT.
NONETHELESS, ECONOMIC SURPRISES
HAVE BEEN VERY POSITIVE IN THE U
K 
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FUNCTION I
HAVE ON THE BLOOMBERG.
RIGHT NOW, I HAVE GOT IT OPEN
FOR THE U.S. AND WE HAVE HAD A
LITTLE GREEN AT THE END.
THAT MEANS POSITIVE SURPRISES
RATHER THAN DISAPPOINTMENTS.
I WILL GO AHEAD AND BLOW UP THIS
CHART.
IT'S A MULTIYEAR LOOK GOING BACK
TO 2009 BUT IF I ZOOM IN ON 2015
AND 2016, YOU CAN SEE IN THE
SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, WE HAVE
HAD A STRING OF REALLY HAS IT IN
ECONOMIC SURPRISES.
IT'S A GREAT FUNCTION AND I
RECOMMEND YOU USE IT.
YOU CAN ASK YOUR SELF WHAT IS
GOING ON AFTER THE U.K. VOTED
FOR A BREXIT.
OLIVER: SO THAT IS A VERY SORT
OF DOMESTIC LOOKING FUNCTION FOR

MULTINATIONAL STOCKS DOING WELL.
I WILL LOOK AT SOME MORE
DOMESTIC NUMBERS IN THE U.K.
THAT SUGGESTED MAYBE NOT JUST
LARGER COMPANIES TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF THE WEAKER POUND.
THIS IS RETAIL SALES IN THE U.K.

NOT ONLY WAS IT AN EXPECTATION

MORE OPTIMISM ON THE ECONOMY
OVERALL.

>> SOME SAY THERE IS NEVER GOING
TO BE A RATE HIKE EVER AGAIN.
>> LET'S SWITCH GEARS TO CHINA.
I WANT TO LOOK AT HOW IT HAS
BEEN DECLINING.
THIS IS A DEPRECIATION BY THE
CHINESE GOVERNMENT.
IT'S A NORMALIZED CHART.
EVERYTHING GOES BACK TO 100.
IT HAS BEEN FALLING AGAINST THE
CURRENCIES SINCE ITS INCEPTION.
THE BASKET IS THE WHITE LINE.
MATT: THERE IS A WHITE LINE?
SCARLET: IT IS IN THE MIDDLE.
DOWN 7%.
IN TERMS OF WHO THE STEEPEST
LOSSES ARE, MAINLY THE YEN AND
THE RUBLE.
THE CHINESE YUAN HAS GAINED.
THE WEAKNESS AND CHINA'S
CURRENCY KEEPS FINANCIAL
CONDITIONS ON THE LOOSER SIDE.
THIS WEAKNESS IS PROBABLY A
CONCERN.
MATT: FOR THE RETAILERS ON
SLOAN'S THE -- SLOAN STREET IT
IS GOOD.
SCARLET: GREAT POINT.
OLIVER: WE WILL STICK WITH
CHINA.
THERE IS SOME STUFF YOU MAY HAVE
MISSED, TOURISM BOOM CLAIMS
DON'T ADD UP.
THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS
IS THE NUMBERS DON'T MAKE SENSE.
HERE WITH US NOW IS A SENIOR
FELLOW AT THE GROUP WHO DID THIS
STUDY.
WE TOOK A MINUTE TO FIGURE OUT
THE TERMINOLOGY.
CHINA SAYS THERE IS A TOURISM
DEFICIT.
CHINESE TOURISTS ARE SPENDING
MORE ABROAD.
IS THAT THE TOP LINE CASE?
WHAT IS CHINA SAYING ABOUT THAT?
>> THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT CHINA IS
SAYING.
CHINESE TOURISTS DO SPEND MORE
OUTSIDE OF CHINA THAN FOREIGN
TOURISTS.
THE QUESTION IS THE PACE.
IN 2013 CHINA REPORTED CHINESE
TOURISTS TRAVELING ABROAD SPENT
$100 BILLION OUTSIDE OF CHINA.
THAT HAS GONE UP TO $300
BILLION.
IT'S A SPECTACULAR RISE.
THAT'S ALMOST EQUAL TO THE FALL
IN CHINESE SPENDING ON
COMMODITIES.
MATT: THAT IS HUGE OUTFLOWS.
DOES THAT WORRY THE GOVERNMENT?
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE TRYING
TO GET THEIR MONEY OUT OF
CHINESE ASSETS.
>> THAT'S THE MOST LIKELY
EXPLANATION.
SOME OF THE INCREASE IN TOURIST
SPENDING IS CAPITAL OUTFLOWS.
THERE IS AN OFFSET.
THE OTHER IMPLICATION IS CHINA
IS RUNNING A BEER AND -- BIGGER
CURRENT ACCOUNT, A GOODS AND
SERVICES SURPLUS THAN IS
REPORTED SO IT HAS MORE CAPACITY
TO SUSTAIN.
SCARLET: WE HAVE A CHART THAT
EXPLAINS WHY IT IS SUSPICIOUS
DATA.
THEY ARE SHOWING THE NUMBERS
CHINA CLAIMS DON'T QUITE ADD UP.
>> THERE IS.
.
IN THE U.S. DATA IT IS UP BY 50%
WHICH IS REASONABLE.
THERE IS NO DOUBT THERE HAS BEEN
A STRONGER INCREASE IN JAPAN.
WHAT THE BIG DISCREPANCY IS IS
HONG KONG.
THERE IS TRADITIONALLY A LOT OF
CHINESE TOURISTS THAT GO TO HONG
KONG.
THEY DO NOT PROVIDE A BREAKDOWN
OF SPENDING.
SCARLET: THERE IS THE LINE AT
THE BOTTOM.
>> TOTAL SPENDING HAS FALLEN.
EVEN AS THEY REPORTED SPENDING
MORE.
HISTORICALLY 30-40% OF CHINESE
TOURISM HAS SHOWN UP OVER THE
PAST TWO YEARS THAT HAS GONE
DOWN TO 10%.
IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.
OLIVER: I WANT TO GET TO WHY
THIS MATTERS.
WHY THEY MAY BE FIGHTING THESE
NUMBERS YOU ARE CASTING DOUBT
ON.
YOU MENTIONED A GOOD SURPLUS.
ARE THEY BASICALLY SAYING
PERHAPS THERE IS MORE MONEY
GOING OUT THE A TOURISM?
PEOPLE ARE SPENDING MONEY
ELSEWHERE INSTEAD OF IN CHINA?
WHAT WAS THE MOTIVATION BE?
GUEST: I'M NOT CONVINCED IT IS A
CONSPIRATORIAL THING.
UNAMBIGUOUSLY AS CHINESE
INVESTMENT HAS SLOWED CHINESE
DEMAND FOR THE REST OF THE
WORLD'S GOODS HAS FALLEN.
YOU SEE CHINA IS SPENDING ON
IMPORTED COMMODITIES HAS TANKED.
THAT HAS HAD REVERBERATIONS
THROUGH THE REST OF THE WORLD.
IF THE TOURISM DATE IS REAL THEN
A LOT OF THE DECREASE IN CHINESE
SPENDING ON GOODS HAS BEEN
OFFSET BY INCREASED CHINESE
SPENDING BY CHINESE TOURISTS.
THE AGGREGATE IMPACT SHOULD NOT
BE THAT BAD.
IF IT IS CHINESE TOURISTS BUYING
FINANCIAL ASSETS THAT DOESN'T
GENERATE DEMAND.
THAT GENERATES A GLOBAL SAVING.
>> THAT WOULD BE CAPITAL
OUTFLOWS.
>> EXACTLY.
YOU CAN SEE DEMAND SETTING ASIDE
THE POSSIBILITY OF THE U.S. RATE
HIKE.
IN GENERAL DO NOT NEED MORE RATE
HIKE FOR NOW.
>> IT CHANGES THE NARRATIVE.
THE GOOD SURPLUS WOULD SUGGEST
THEY ARE GETTING MORE OF THE
THINGS THEY NEED DOMESTICALLY.
THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY IS STARTING
TO GROW WHICH IS WHAT THEY WANT
HIM A WHICH IS WHAT EVERYONE
WANTS.
IF THE TOURISM NUMBERS ARE RIGHT
MAY BE THEY ARE GETTING FOREIGN
PRODUCTS AND BRINGING IN FOREIGN
THINGS THROUGH OTHER MEANS.
>> THAT IS A POSSIBLE ARGUMENT.
THE HARD PART IS, YOU LOOK AT
INDICATORS.
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATCH UP ANY
BETTER.
IN GENERAL YES.
THERE IS A STORY ABOUT IMPORT
SUBSTITUTION.
MATT: THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THAT
SOSA SINGLY.
>> THE WAY THAT THAT IS NOT SO
BAD FOR THE WORLD IS A CHINESE
TOURISTS ARE SPENDING A LOT
OUTSIDE OF CHINA.
IF THEY ARE NOT THE POSITIVE
IMPACT FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD
IS WEAKER.
>> WHICH OF THESE DO YOU FEEL IS
THE MOST POSSIBLE?
>> SOME OF THE INCREASE IS REAL.
THERE HAS BEEN GROWTH IN CHINESE
TOURISM AND OTHER DESTINATIONS.
THAT INCREASE IS NOT BIG ENOUGH
TO EXPLAIN THE FULL GROWTH.
IN MEANINGFUL PART IS DISGUISED
CAPITAL OUTFLOWS.
THE MORE IMPORTANT ARAB --
IMPLICATION IS NOT THAT THERE IS
MONEY LEAVING CHINA.
CHINA IS PROVIDING LESS DEMAND
TO THE REST OF THE WORLD.
>> GREAT PAPER.
FAIRLY SOPHISTICATED
CONVERSATION FOR A FRIDAY.
THANK YOU.

BANNON.
HE WAS HOPING HE WOULD MAKE IT
MORE FOCUSED ON HILLARY CLINTON.
THE PROBLEM IS HE BROUGHT WITH
HIM THIS ALT RIGHT ASSOCIATION
THAT OPENED THE DOOR FOR THE
CLINTON CAMPAIGN TO TRY AND
CONNECT DONALD TRUMP IN A WAY
THAT IS GOING TO BE VERY
SUCCESSFUL AND HAS TURNED THE
CAMPAIGN IN 20 REFERENDUM ON
RACE.
>> THE ALT RIGHT MOVEMENT IS
LINKED TO A RACIST
SELF-PROFESSED WHITE SUPREMACY
IDEOLOGUE.
CALL GRAYBAR -- TO CALL GRAYBAR
BREIBART ALT RIGHT, IS IT A
RACIST PUBLICATION?
GUEST: I WOULD ARGUE IT IS
BROADER THAN WHITE SUPREMACISTS.
IT ENCOMPASSES EVERYONE FROM
NATIONALISTS, POPULISTS, AMERICA
FIRST FOREIGN POLICY ALL THE WAY
TO ACTUAL WHITE SUPREMACISTS.
IT TENDS TO GO OUT OF ITS WAY TO
BE OFFENSIVE AND AGGRESSIVE.
IT IS ACTIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
A LOT OF THOSE SELF -- A LOT OF
THOSE PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN BEHIND
DONALD TRUMP.
MATT: I'M TRYING TO GET MY HEAD
AROUND THIS.
IT HAS POPPED UP IN THE PAST
COUPLE OF DAYS ALTHOUGH IT DATES
BACK YEARS.
IS THIS NOT A NEW TERM?
SCARLET: IT'S A NEW TERM FOR THE
WEEK.
CARL ICAHN ISSUING A STATEMENT

CONTINUES TO BELIEVE IN THE
COMPANY.
HE NEVER GAVE AN ORDER TO SHOW
-- SELL ANY SHARES.
HE'S RESPONDING TO RUMORS HE WAS
TRYING TO SELL HIS SHARES IN THE

YOU CAN SEE THAT FOLLOWING HIS
REMARKS THE STOCK IS UP.

SCARLET: TODAY'S TOP STORY,
JANET YELLEN'S COMMENTS FROM
JACKSON HOLE.
SHE SAYS THE CASE FOR AN
INCREASE HAS STRENGTHENED.
>> THE ECONOMY WEAKENS IN THE
FIRST PART OF THIS YEAR AND IT
IS NOT CLEAR.
AS THEY MOVED TO THE MIDDLE PART
OF THE YEAR WE HAVE INCOMING
DATA SUGGESTING THE ECONOMY IS
ON THE PATH IT HAS BEEN FOR SOME
YEARS, GROWTH STRONG ENOUGH TO
SUPPORT IMPROVING THE LABOR
MARKET WHICH IS TO SAY JOB
CREATION THAT IS TAKING SLACK
OUT OF THE LAKE IT -- LABOR
MARKET.
IN INFLATION MOVING BACK TO 2%.
I FEEL CONSTRUCTIVE ABOUT THE
ECONOMY TODAY.
>> DO YOU THINK THE RATES NEED
TO RISE?
>> MY VIEW IS WE SHOULD BE ON A
PROGRAM OF GRADUAL RATE
INCREASES.
WHEN WE SEE PROGRESS AND GROWTH
STRONG ENOUGH TO SUPPORT ALL OF
THAT WE SHOULD TAKE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO.
IN THE ABSENCE OF SOME BIG EVENT
LIKE THE BREXIT OR SUCH.
IT HAS BEEN MY VIEW.
>> HAS THE THAT BEEN THROWN OFF
BY TWO MANY EVENTS?
SHOULD THEY HAVE CONCENTRATED
MORE ON JUST RESPONDING TO THE
FUNDAMENTALS OF THE U.S.
ECONOMY?
>> I DON'T.
WE ARE BEING DATA-DRIVEN AND
PATIENT AND CAUTIOUS.
DEMAND IS WEAK AROUND THE WORLD.
OTHER CENTRAL BANKS ARE CUTTING
RATES.
WE ARE BELOW OUR INFLATION
TARGET.
GROWTH WAS ONE AND A QUARTER
PERCENT.
OUR CAUTION IS APPROPRIATE AND
IT HAS PAID DIVIDENDS.
>> WHERE WOULD YOU PUT A FED
FUNDS RATE?
>> THE RATE THAT WOULD BE IN
PLACE WHEN YOU'RE AT FULL
EMPLOYMENT AND 2% INFLATION
WOULD BE 3% OR LOWER.
THAT IS MORE THAN A FULL
PERCENTAGE POINT LOWER THAN
BEFORE THE CRISIS.
>> HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE?
HOW FAST DO YOU GO TO GET THERE?
>> THAT IS GOING TO DEPEND ON
INCOMING DATA.
THERE IS NO PRESET COURSE.
YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW THE ECONOMY
PERFORMS.
DO WE CONTINUE ON THIS PATH?
IF WE DO AROUND 2% AND GOOD JOB
CREATION THEN WE SHOULD BE
PATIENTLY RAISING INTEREST RATES
AS THE ECONOMY IN THE GLOBAL
ECONOMY WARRANT.
>> THE ARGUMENT HAS BEEN AS
UNEMPLOYMENT GOES DOWN INFLATION
SHOULD GO UP.
IT HAS COME WAY DOWN.
INFLATION HAS NOT GONE UP.
ARE YOU A BELIEVER?
>> IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION.
THERE IS THE WAGE THE LIPS
CURVE.
AS THE LABOR MARKET TIGHTENS THE
WAGES SHOULD GO UP.
WE ARE SEEING CLEAR BUT NOT
STRONG EVIDENCE THAT WAGES ARE
MOVING UPWARD.
THE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN WAGES
AND PRICES HAS WEAKENED.
THE TRANSMISSION BETWEEN SLACK
IN THE LABOR MARKET HAS WEEKEND.
THE PHILLIPS CURVE IS FLAT.
IT IS MUCH WEAKER THAN IT HAS
BEEN HISTORICALLY.
>> WHAT GIVES YOU CONFIDENCE YOU
WILL GET TO THE TARGET?
>> CORE PCE INFLATION IS 1.6%.
MAYBE 30 BASIS POINTS YOU CAN
ATTRIBUTE TO THE STRONG DAUGHTER
-- STRONG DOLLAR.
IF WE MOVE THROUGH THOSE, THAT
GETS YOU FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE 2%.
IT DOESN'T LEAVE A BIG GAP
BETWEEN WHERE YOU WOULD DO -- BE
FOR THOSE.
IF WE STAY ON THAT PATH THEN THE
DOLLAR HAS BEEN GOING DOWN THIS
YEAR A LITTLE BIT.
2% INFLATION WOULD BE VERY
CLOSE.
>> >> S'MORE BREAKING NEWS, IT
APPEARS HERBALIFE'S SHAREHOLDER
HAS REPORTED A STAKE AFTER HE
ADDED TO HIS SHARES IN THE
COMPANY.
HE BOUGHT 2.3 SHARES.
THIS IS HIS ANNOUNCEMENT.
IT IS LEADING TO A GAIN.
