SCARLET: WE ARE MOMENTS AWAY
FROM THE CLOSING BELL.
I AM SCARLET FU.
JOEL: I'M JOE WEISENTHAL.
OLIVER: AND I AM OLIVER RUNNING
-- OLIVER.
SCARLET: ALL THREE INDEXES
FINISHING A NEW HIGHS.
WE TALK ABOUT WHY THE SECOND
INNING OF BREXIT MAY BE WORSE
THAN THE FIRST.
>> PLUS, JAPAN'S PRIME MINISTER
-- JAPAN'S EMPEROR MAY WANT TO
RETIRE.
WE LOOK AT HOW THIS COULD AFFECT
THE PRIME MINISTER.
OLIVER: AND WE HAVE THE CHARTS
YOU CANNOT MISS.
SCARLET: ALL THREE BENCHMARK
INDEXES CLOSING AT RECORD HIGHS
YET AGAIN.
ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER RECORD.
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE VOLUME,
TRADING ON THE DOW AND S&P WERE
A DOUBLE DIGIT PERCENTAGES BELOW
AVERAGE.
IT IS MID-AUGUST, AFTER ALL, AND
EARNINGS SEASON IS A SICKLY
OVER.
EVERYONE IS -- IS BASICALLY
OVER.
OLIVER: I WILL POINT OUT THAT IF
YOU LOOK AT THE VALUE OF STOCKS,
THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO LOOK
AT VOLUME, AND THE TOTAL VALUE
IS PRETTY HIGH.
JOE: TODAY, WE SAW SAFETY AREAS
OF THE MARKET LAG WHILE SOME
RISKIER AREAS ARE DOING PRETTY
WELL.
OLIVER: I'M GOING TO JUMP IN AND
TAKE A DEEPER DIVE INTO SOME
MARKET MINUTES.
S&P IS PRETTY INTERESTING.
WE HAVE OBVIOUSLY HAD A BIG
SHIFT IN THE PAST COUPLE OF
WEEKS.
THESE THREE SECTORS DOING WELL
TODAY, MATERIALS, INDUSTRIALS,
ENERGY.
THEY ARE ON A REBOUND AFTER NOT
DOING SO WELL.
STRENGTHEN OIL AFTER A BEAR
MARKET RECENTLY.
WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME SECTORS
THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DOING WELL.
THIS IS YEAR TO DATE FOR
UTILITIES AND TELECOM.
STILL VERY FAR UP, BUT HURTING
TODAY, HURTING RECENTLY.
WE WILL SEE HOW THAT CHANGES AS
WE GO INTO SEPTEMBER.
FINALLY, AS WE JUST POINTED OUT,
THIS IS INCREDIBLE, THE
FIVE-YEAR LOOK AT THE NASDAQ.
THIS IS THE LAST ONE TO CROSS
THE ALL-TIME HIGH RECENTLY.
ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER HIGH.
JOE: HERE IS THE U.S. 10 YEAR
YIELD, DOWN A LITTLE BIT TODAY,
UP ON THE DAY, BUT LOW IN THE
GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS.
ONE MARKET WE DON'T TALK ABOUT
OFTEN IS THE CHINESE SOVEREIGN
BOND MARKET.
THERE IS A NEW LOW ON THE 10
YEAR BOND THERE.
THIS IS FOR A LOT OF THE SAME
REASONS PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT
EVERYWHERE, SLOW GROWTH,
INFLATION, THE REACH FOR SAFETY.
SCARLET: THIS IS SLOW FOR CHINA
IN TERMS OF GROWTH.
I AM TAKING A LOOK AT AUSSIE
CURRENCY, REBUILDING MOMENTUM
AFTER HIGHS OF LAST WEEK.
ALSO, THE BRITISH POUND IS AT A
FRESH 30 YEAR LOW.
IT HAS DIPPED BELOW 129.
EARLIER, IT DIPPED BELOW 128.
WE WILL GET THE FIRST HEARD DATA
ON THE ECONOMY AFTER THE BREXIT
VOTE -- HARD DATA ON THE ECONOMY
AFTER THE BREXIT VOTE IN THE
COMING DAYS.
PEOPLE ARE BEARISH.
JOE: OIL HAD ANOTHER NICE UPDATE
TODAY.
IT WAS BELOW $40 A BARREL AT THE
BEGINNING OF AUGUST, AROUND
AUGUST 2, AND EVERYONE WAS
TURNING NEGATIVE.
IT HAS COME BACK NICELY.
ONCE AGAIN, PEOPLE ARE
OPTIMISTIC.
SCARLET: THAT HAS HELPED THE
COMMODITY CURRENCIES AS WELL.
THOSE ARE TODAY'S MARKET
MINUTES.
LET'S TAKE A DEEP FIVE INTO
BLOOMBERG.
I AM LOOKING AT INVESTORS LOVE
AFFAIR WITH EMERGING-MARKET
ASSETS.
LET'S FOCUS ON THE TOP PANEL.
THE WHITE LINE IS THE FORWARD PE
FOR EMERGING MARKETS.
THE BLUE LINE IS THE FOUR P FOUR
DEVELOPED STOCKS.
WE HAVE -- FORWARD PE FOR
DEVELOPED STOCKS.
WE HAVE DIFFERENT AXES.
THE BOTTOM PANEL IS A RELATIVE
VALUATION, THE SPREAD BETWEEN
THE TWO.
IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE ARE
PAYING THE MOST IN THREE YEARS
TO OWN EMERGING-MARKET STOCKS.
>> PEOPLE LOVE THE EMERGING
MARKETS AGAIN.
JOE: WE HAVE HOMEBUILDER
CONFIDENCE TODAY.
I ALWAYS LIKE LOOKING AT THIS
REPORT.
I LOOKING AT THE REGIONAL
BREAKDOWN.
THE TOP TWO LINES, BLUE AND
WHITE, THE WEST AND SOUTH,
HOMEBUILDERS ARE STILL PRETTY
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THOSE AREAS.
THE LINE AT THE BOTTOM IS THE
NORTHEAST.
THERE IS NOTHING HAPPENING
HERE,TO BUILD HOMES.
IT IS EITHER TOO HOT OR TOO COLD
TO MOVE HERE.
THE WEST IS DOING GREAT, SOUTH
IS DOING GREAT, EVERYTHING ELSE,
NOT SO HOT.
OLIVER: INTERESTING.
I AM NOT SURE I WOULD HAVE
EXPECTED THAT.
I AM GOING TO PLAY SEMANTIC
GAMES FOR MY DEEP DIVE.
I AM LOOKING AT THEIR MARKETS IN
A BULL MARKET.
WE ARE LOOKING AT S&P -- BEAR
MARKETS INSIDE BULL MARKETS.
IN MAY OF 2015, WE SET THE HIGH.
WE SET A NEW HIGH IN JULY.
WE TIPPED THEN WENT BACK UP,
KIND OF TRENDED SIDEWAYS, AND
HAVE HAD TWO 10% CORRECTIONS.
IF YOU TRY TO CARE ARISE HOW
MANY -- CHARACTERIZE HOW MANY
COMPANIES WENT INTO BEAR
MARKETS, IT'S A LOT.
THESE ARE COMPANIES THAT LOST
20% OR MORE AND DID NOT REGAIN
IT BY JULY.
THE ONLY TIME THAT LOOKED
SIMILAR TO THAT IS WHEN WE DID
GO INTO A BEAR MARKET IN 2011.
SCARLET: VERY COOL.
JOE: DAVID FROM BANK OF AMERICA
JOINS US NOW.
THANKS FOR COMING ONTO THE SHOW.
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.
YOU SAID THE DEFINING
CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MARKET
THIS YEAR HAS BEEN THE
SIMULTANEOUS RALLY OF
EVERYTHING, STOCKS, BONDS, IT'S
ALL UP.
IF YOU ARE AN INVESTOR AND YOU
WANT A PORTFOLIO THAT HAS
DIFFERENT PARTS WORKING AT
DIFFERENT TIMES, WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN EVERYTHING IS MOVING IN THE
SAME DIRECTION?
>> IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IN THE
LAST MONTH, EVERY CLIENT I HAVE
SPOKEN TO, EXCEPT FOR THE RISK
PARITY GUYS, IS TELLING ME THIS
HAS BEEN A DISASTER YEAR.
MOST INVESTORS ARE HAVING A VERY
DIFFICULT YEAR EXCEPT FOR RISK
PARITY GUYS.
THE GUYS AT BRIDGEWATER, THE
GUYS WHO ARE RUNNING SYSTEMATIC
STRATEGY BASED ON THE IDEA OF
RISK PARITY.
THEY ARE KILLING IT THIS YEAR.
JOE: THIS IS A CHART OF BANK OF
AMERICA MULTI-ASSET STRATEGY
GOING BACK FIVE YEARS.
YOU CAN SEE THAT IT HAS BEEN A
ROCKET SHIP.
>> EXACTLY.
TYPICALLY, THESE PORTFOLIOS ARE
LONG TREASURIES, LONG STOCKS.
THE ONLY SITUATION IN WHICH
STOCKS AND BONDS ARE GOING TO DO
WELL IS DURING A PHASE OF
MONETARY EASING.
THEY FED IS GOING TO REMOVE
ACCOMMODATION GRADUALLY BUT THE
U.S. IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO
IMPORT QE FROM JAPAN AND EUROPE.
THAT IS WHAT IS SO STRIKING.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE BASIC
FINANCIAL INDEX, WE HAVE SEEN A
DRAMATIC EASING OF THE INDEX
SINCE BREXIT.
WE HAVE STARTED TO PICK UP DATA
IN THE U.S. THAT THE BEST WAY TO
BE POSITIONED IN THE SECOND HALF
OF THE YEAR IS MORE MONETARY
EASING.
OLIVER: WE TALK ABOUT THE FED
MODEL THAT SAYS THAT EQUITY
YIELD AND BOND YIELDS SHOULD BE
CLOSER THAN THEY ARE RIGHT NOW.
THEY COULD BOTH LOSE VALUE
TOGETHER.
INVESTORS HAVE EXPOSURE TO BOTH.
COULD THEY GET HIT HARDER GOING
INTO THE SECOND HALF OR IS THERE
A SHIFT?
>> THE LAST TIME WE SAW
SOMETHING LIKE THIS WAS 2012.
2013, WE HAD THE WHOLE THING
THAT REALLY FETCHING'S UP --
REALLY SHOOK THINGS UP.
NOW, OF COURSE, YOU COULD SAY
THAT GOING INTO JACKSON HOLE,
RIGHT NOW, THE MARKET IS PRICING
IN LESS THAN A 10% CHANCE OF A
HIKE IN SEPTEMBER.
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE RISKIER
ASSETS DOING WELL.
PEOPLE ARE GETTING MORE
CONFIDENT ABOUT GROWTH OUTLOOK.
THE OTHER ASPECT OF THIS,
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST AS FAR AS
THE MARKET IS CONCERNED, IS THE
ELECTION.
I THINK THE ONLY WAY THE MARKET
CAN BE RIGHT IS IF WE END UP
WITH GRIDLOCK.
ANY OTHER OUTCOME, MEANING, IF
THERE IS A CLEAN SWEEP, WE WILL
PROBABLY SEE A BIG CHANGE IN
FISCAL POLICY NEXT YEAR.
SCARLET: WE LOVE IT WHEN GUESTS
MENTION PROPRIETARY INDEXES.
YOU TALKED ABOUT VOLATILITY IN
THE DIFFERENT ASSET CLASSES AND
HOW IT HAS COME DOWN QUITE A
BIT.
WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT
POSITIONING.
POSITIONING RIGHT NOW SEEMS TO
BE TRUMPING FUNDAMENTALS.
WHY IS IT MORE PRONOUNCED THIS
YEAR THAN IN PAST YEARS?
>> I THINK THE MAIN REASON IS
INVESTORS ARE STRUGGLING.
ARE YOU GOING TO DO THE SAME
TRADE AS EVERYBODY ELSE?
IF THE TRADE GOES DOWN, YOU KEEP
YOUR JOB.
IF YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON AND
THE TRADE GOES WRONG, YOU WILL
PROBABLY LOSE YOUR JOB.
INVESTORS HAVE TO REDEEM AND
SELL WHATEVER IS OVERWEIGHT.
WHATEVER IS OVERWEIGHT IS
UNDERPERFORMING.
THERE IS NO QUESTION.
IT IS ALMOST AT THE POINT WHERE
INVESTORS ARE RECONCILED TO THE
IDEA THAT FUNDAMENTALS DON'T
MATTER ANYMORE.
OLIVER: SO, WHAT SPECIFICALLY DO
YOU RECOMMEND THEY DO AS OPPOSED
TO JUST CHASING WHAT IS GOING
UP?
>> BETWEEN YOU AND I, SINCE 1980
FIVE, GOING INTO ELECTIONS,
PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT UNCERTAINTY.
RIGHT NOW, THE WAY THE MARKET IS
POSITIONED, VERY LONG RISK
PARITY, SUGGESTS THE MARKET
THINKS THIS WILL BE A WALK IN
THE PARK FOR HILLARY CLINTON.
THE MARKET IS LOOKING TO PLAY
FORWARD WITH THAT TRANSITION,
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOUR VIEW MAY
BE.
THE MARKET IS FACTORING IN A
CLEAN SWEEP.
SOME THINGS ARE VERY UNDERPRICED
IN THE MARKET RIGHT NOW.
SCARLET: THANK YOU.
YOU ARE STAYING WITH US.

SCARLET: THANK YOU, MARK.
DAVID, YOU HAVE NOTED THAT
INVESTORS SEEM TO BE INDIFFERENT
TO CHINA'S GRADUAL YOUNG -- YOU
ON -- YUAN DEVALUATION.
WHY IS THAT?
>> I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT
REASON IS THAT CHINA HAS BEEN
VERY SUCCESSFUL IN CRACKING DOWN
ON CAPITAL OUTFLOWS.
CAPITAL OUTFLOWS ARE SLOW AND
THEY ARE NOT INTERVENING MUCH.
I WILL TELL YOU WHY THAT IS
IMPORTANT.
I HAD LUNCH WITH MY REAL ESTATE
AGENT THE OTHER DAY, AND HE WAS
TELLING ME THAT LAST YEAR, 21
PERCENT OF APARTMENTS SOLD IN
NEW YORK CITY WERE SOLD TO
CHINESE INVESTORS.
THIS YEAR, IT IS 0%.
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE CHINESE
TO GET AUTHORIZATION TO MAKE
FOREIGN INVESTMENTS.
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS
CRACKED DOWN AND CLOSED THE
BORDERS.
THIS IS WHY CHINA HAS NOT HAD TO
SELL COMMODITIES OR STOCKS.
DEPRECIATION HAS BEEN FAIRLY
LIMITED.
OLIVER: RIGHT NOW, YOU WOULD
FAVOR A LONG U.S. DOLLAR VERSUS
THE CHINESE CURRENCY.
DEPRECIATION IS HAPPENING AT A
SLOWER RATE.
>> FOR ONE THING, THE LESS THE
MARKET CARES ABOUT THE MARKET
GOING DOWN, THE LESS IT GOING TO
GO.
THAT WITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT
CHINA'S STOCK MARKET HAS BEEN
 STRUGGLING, THEY HAVE NOT
CUT INTEREST RATES.
EVERYBODY ELSE HAS CUT INTEREST
RATES EXCEPT FOR CHINA.
THEY DON'T WANT MORE LEVERAGE.
THEY DON'T WANT TO CUT INTEREST
RATES BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT
MORE DEBT.
THE ONLY THING LEFT ON THE TABLE
IS WEAKER R&B.
SO YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE R&B HAS
ROOM TO FALL.
OLIVER: LET'S TALK ABOUT JAPAN.
AFTER RECENT ELECTIONS, THERE
WAS A HOPE THERE WOULD BE MORE
VIGOROUS STIMULUS.
THE BOJ SAID THEY WOULD VISIT TO
THEIR MONETARY FRAMEWORK.
WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR
JAPAN AND AROUND THE WORLD?
>> THERE IS NOTHING MORE
IMPORTANT TO ME THAN JAPAN RIGHT
NOW, AND IT SHOULD BE FOR
EVERYBODY.
THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL BEEN
GOING THROUGH A JAPANESE
VACATION IN THE LAST COUPLE OF
YEARS.
WHETHER JAPAN WILL BE SUCCESSFUL
OR NOT WILL TELL YOU A LOT ABOUT
ONCE IN STORE FOR EVERYBODY
ELSE.
AT THIS POINT, THE ONLY THING
LEFT ON THE TABLE AS FAR AS
JAPAN IS CONCERNED IS HELL A
 HELICOPTER MONEY.
WE ARE TALKING MAJOR FISCAL
STIMULUS.
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO GET THEM
GOING.
EVERYBODY WANTS TO WATCH HOW BAD
THINGS ARE GOING TO GET FOR
JAPAN.
I DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE YET.
IF YOU ASKED ME WHAT WAS THE
SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT DAY IN
2016 SO FAR, IT HAS TO BE
JANUARY 29, ON WHICH DAY THE
JOBLESS RATE WAS NEGATIVE IN THE
NIKKEI SOLD OFF.
AFTER THAT, NOBODY WAS TALKING

THERE WAS ONE THING THAT WAS
INTERESTING TODAY.
A COUPLE OF REPORTS OF BANK OF
AMERICA.
YOU SEE THE STOCK'S DOING WELL.
EMPLOYEES STOCKS NOT DOING SO
WELL.
IT IS GETTING INVESTORS BULLISH.
REALLY THROUGHOUT THIS QUARTER
THEY HAVE BEEN BUYING AND NOT
SELLING STOCKS.
WHAT DID YOU MISS?
THE NASDAQ'S NEXT BIG MOVE.
NASDAQ IS ROLLING OUT A FUNCTION
CALLED EXTENDED LIGHT ORDERS TO
COMPETE WITH IDX.
THE STARTUP BEGINS TRADING ON
FRIDAY WITH A 350 MICROSECOND
DELAY IN ORDERS.
A SPEED BUMP.
BETTY: I LIKE HOW YOU ARE BORED
WITH RECORD AFTER RECORD.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
BOB: GOOD TO BE HERE, BETTY.
BETTY: HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT
FROM THE IDX SPEEDBUMP?
BOB: WE TALK -- WE TALKED TO
EVERYONE INTERESTED IN ONE THING
WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR,
ESPECIALLY FROM A TECHNOLOGY
FOCUS, IS THAT PEOPLE LIKE A
SPEEDBUMP WHERE YOU ARE DELAYING
THE ONSLAUGHT OF TECHNOLOGY AS
PROGRESS.
WHATEVER IT IS TODAY FROM A
TECHNOLOGY POINT OF VIEW LOOKS
ARCHAIC FROM FIVE YEARS FROM
NOW.
WE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING THAT
WAS POSITIVE AND POWERING.
IF YOU WANT TO PUT AN ORDER IN
FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME, WE
WILL GIVE YOU A REWARD.
THAT IS LARGE AND IMPORTANT.
BETTY: WE ARE GOING TO BUMP YOU
UP.
BOB: YOU WILL GO TO THE FRONT OF
THE LINE.
YOU WILL GET EARLIER EXECUTION.
IF YOU ARE A BIT SLOWER, YOU
COULD BE A MICROSECOND, A DAY, A
WEEK SLOWER, THAT IF YOU ARE
WILLING TO MAKE A COMMITMENT YOU
WILL GET THE REWARD OF GOING TO
THE FRONT OF THE LINE.
BETTY: WHAT HAPPENED?
YOU PROTESTED, YOU DID NOT WANT
THE SEC TO APPROVE IE X AND WERE
AGAINST THE SPEED BUMPS.
BOB: WE WERE AGAINST THE
PROCESS.
WE THINK THE SEC DID NOT CARRY
OUT THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES.
THE RULE OF THE LAND SAYS YOUR
QUOTE HAS TO BE IMMEDIATELY
ACCESSIBLE WITHOUT ARTIFICIAL
DELAY.
IF THE SEC WANTS TO CHANGE THAT,
IT SHOULD HAVE GONE TO COMMENT
AND REVIEW AND LET THE MARKET
ADJUST TO THAT.
DID NOT HAPPEN.
BETTY: YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM, SO
JOIN THEM?
BOB: NO.
WE ARE OBJECTING TO THE PROCESS.
THIS ORDER TYPE WE HAVE TO
SUBMIT HAS TO GO THROUGH NORMAL
COMMENT AND REVIEW.
IN THE PAST, WE HAVE TRIED TO
PRESENT TO THE COMMISSION
SOMETHING LIKE A SPEED BUMP AND
IT DID NOT GET APPROVAL.
THEY DID NOT WANT US TO GO
THROUGH THAT PROCESS.
WE USE THAT AS A WAY TO START
THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN WE
IMPROVE THE INVESTOR EXPERIENCE
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES IN
RESPECT TO THE ARTIFICIAL DELAY
BEING PUT IN.
WHAT CAN WE DO?
OUR CUSTOMERS SAID WE WANT TO
HAVE THE ABILITY TO BE REWARDED
BY THE FACT THAT THEY ARE
LONG-TERM INVESTORS THAT DON'T
CARE ABOUT THE MICROSECOND
DIFFERENTIAL.
THIS REWARD AS THE GREAT
ADVANTAGE OF BEING SIMPLE.
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT A SPEED
BUMP, AS YOU TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT
TO PEOPLE, IT IS VERY
COMPLICATED.
YOU TALK ABOUT A LIMITED ORDER
THAT HAS A SECOND DURATION TO
GET TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE.
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT.
BETTY: WHO WAS ASKING FOR THAT?
BOB: WE HAVE NOT FOUND ANYBODY
WHO DOES NOT WANT THIS TYPE OF
CAPABILITY IN THE MARKING -- IN
THE MARKETPLACE.
THE SIMPLICITY OF IT IS WHAT IS
APPEALING TO A LARGE NUMBER OF
PEOPLE.
WE THINK THE INITIAL ADOPTIVE
WILL BE THE BUY SIDE, WHO DOES
NOT CARE ABOUT THE DIFFERENTIAL.
I WILL GIVE YOU TWO SECONDS TO
GET TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE.
WE ALSO THINK THAT THE FIRM'S
HAVE ENGAGED IN HIGH DEGREES OF
TRADING TODAY AND WILL FIND
POSITIVE WAYS OF USING THIS.
BETTY: SOME OF THE REACTION TO
HEARING ABOUT THIS HAS BEEN,
LOOK, NASDAQ, INCREASING IT HAS
BEEN FOCUSED ON TECHNOLOGY.
BOB: WE HAVE TO BE.
BETTY: SPEED IS EVERYTHING IN
THIS MARKET.
AT LEAST, THAT IS WHAT IT HAS
BEEN UP TO NOW.
AS TECHNOLOGY IS DELIVERING MORE
SPEED ON THAT SIDE OF YOUR
BUSINESS, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO
INTRODUCE A PRODUCT THAT COULD
SLOW THAT PROCESS DOWN?
BOB: I WILL DISAGREE WITH THE
COMMENT THAT SPEED HAS BEEN
EVERYTHING IN THE MARKET.
CAPITAL IS A DOMINANT FACTOR IN
THE MARKET.
IF SOMEONE WANTS TO COMMIT TO A
BUYING OR SELLING COMMITMENT,
THAT IS A DIFFERENCE THERE.
WE CANNOT BE ANY POSITION WHERE
WE WANT TO STOP TECHNOLOGY.
TECHNOLOGY WILL ADVANCE.
THE GREAT PART OF THIS
ANNOUNCEMENT IS THAT IN A SIMPLE
WAY, WE ALLOW TECHNOLOGY TO
CONTINUE.
THERE IS NO ARTIFICIAL DELAY.
YOU KNOW HAVE A CHOICE -- YOU
NOW HAVE A CHOICE.
IT CHANGES MARKET STRUCTURE
WHERE YOU CAN HAVE THE ADVANTAGE
BY GOING TO THE FRONT OF THE
LINE BY MAKING A COMMITMENT TO
THE MARKETPLACE.
BETTY: HAVEN'T YOU SAID BEFORE
THAT INTRODUCING AN ORDER WILL
COMPLICATE THE MARKETS EVEN
MORE?
BOB: IF YOU HAVE A SPEEDBUMP
THAT HAS 350 SECONDS MICRO
SECONDS, SOMEONE WILL COME OUT
WITH 344 330.
IT SIMPLIFIES THE MARKETS.
AS IT WAS PRESENTED TO ME, I
SAID THE GENIUS OF THIS IS THE
SIMPLICITY.
YOU MAKE THE COMMITMENT, YOU GO
TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE.
HARD STOP.
THE FIRST THING WE HAD WAS THE
MARKET ORDER.
AFTER THAT, PEOPLE CAME UP WITH
A LIMIT ORDER.
I SUBMIT THAT THIS ADVANCE WHERE
WE HAVE A LIMIT ORDER THAT HAS
ADVANTAGE BASED UPON A
COMMITMENT TO IT WILL REPRESENT
A FUNDAMENTAL EVOLUTION OF
MARKET STRUCTURE SIMILAR TO WHAT
WE SAW WITH LIMITS COMING IN.
BETTY: I CAN'T LET YOU GO
WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT THE IPO
MARKET.
WE KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT HAS
BEEN IN THE U.S. 
SOME COMPANIES ON THE PIPELINE
ARE ABOUT TO GO PUBLIC.
I'M TALKING ABOUT ASIA IN
PARTICULAR.
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR COMPANIES
TO BREAK OUT INTO THE PUBLIC.
WE HAVE SEEN ASIAN COMPANIES
WANT TO STAY THERE BECAUSE THEY
ARE GETTING HIGHER VALUATION.
HOW DO YOU GET THEM HERE?
BOB: I THINK THE IPO MARKET IS
DISAPPOINTING BUT NOT DISMAL.
BETTY: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?
BOB: COMPANIES ARE GOING PUBLIC.
THE WINDOW IS NOT SHUT.
WE HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF
COMPANIES COME PUBLIC IN THE
LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS.
WITH RESPECT TO OUR ATTRACTION
ON A GLOBAL BASIS, IT COMES DOWN
TO THE FACT WE HAVE THE DEPTH OF
THE QUIDDITY, WE HAVE A STRONG
ANALYST COMMUNITY, AND TO HAVE
YOUR COMPANY FULLY VALUED OVER A
LONG PERIOD OF TIME, THERE IS
NOTHING LIKE THE U.S. EQUITY

HAVE TO REVISE THE PEACEFUL
CONSTITUTION.
WHAT IS GOING ON?
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT TO PLAY OUT
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS AS
WE FIND OUT ABOUT THE INTENT TO
STEP DOWN?
SHEILA: TWO THINGS ARE HAPPENING
HERE.
IN A VIDEO, THE EMPEROR SAYS HE
WOULD RATHER STEP DOWN BEFORE
HIS DEATH, ALLOWING
SUCCESSION THAT IS SMOOTH AND
STEADY AND WOULD NOT AFFECT THE
DAILY LIVES OF THE JAPANESE.
AS HE POINTED OUT, THIS COMES ON
THE BACKDROP OF A FAIRLY HEALTHY
JAPANESE DEBATE OVER WHETHER OR
NOT TO BEGIN TALKS ABOUT WHETHER
TO REVISE THE CONSTITUTION.
NO ONE AT THE MOMENT THINKS THAT
THE REQUEST WILL REQUIRE
TOUCHING ARTICLE TWO OF THE
CONSTITUTION, WHICH REFERS TO
THE ROLE OF EMPEROR.
SCARLET: SHINZO ABE DID WELL IN
RECENT ELECTIONS AND HE HAS BEEN
VOCAL IN HIS OPPOSITION.
SHEILA: THERE'S AN ELECTION IN
JULY IN THE UPPER HOUSE.
HER THE FIRST TIME IN THE
PRO-WAR PERIOD, PEOPLE WHO WERE
OPEN TO TALKING ABOUT
CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION MANAGED
TO WIN.
ABE'S RULING COALITION, HIS OWN
PARTY AND SMALLER PART, WILL BEK
GUIDING THE CONVERSATION.
OME -- BE GUIDING THE
CONVERSATION.
KOME IS NOT EXCITED ABOUT IT.
THE LARGER QUESTION IS ABE'S
JUDGED ON WHETHER HE MANAGES TO
STIMULATE GROWTH IN THE JAPANESE
ECONOMY.
WAGES REMAIN LOW.
THERE HAS NOT BEEN CHANGE IN
ORDINARY JAPANESE FAMILIES.
HE IS TRYING TO MANAGE HIS
CONVERSATION WITH JAPANESE
COMPANIES TO SEE IF THEY WILL
LET GO OF SOME OF THE PROFITS
AND INVEST IN THE JAPANESE LABOR
FORCE.
>> WHAT ARE THE CHANCES ON THAT?
HE HAS BEEN IN POWER FOR YEARS.
THERE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTS AT
FISCAL STIMULUS.
THE ATTEMPTS OF THE BOJ HAVE
BEEN MIXED AT BEST.
DO YOU SEE ANY REAL PROSPECT FOR
TURNING A CORNER IN A POSITIVE
WAY AND IS THERE ANYTHING HE CAN
DO SPECIFICALLY?
SHEILA: WE WERE WATCHING
JAPANESE POLICYMAKERS MOVED BACK
TO A MORE TRADITIONAL APPROACH
TO STIMULATE GROWTH.
HE HAS A HUGE STIMULUS IN THE
WORKS WHICH INCLUDES
INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDING TO R
URAL LOCALES.
HE HAS TAPPED A COUPLE OF SENIOR
LDP PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT WAYS
TO BRING MORE OF THE POPULATION
CONCENTRATED IN TOKYO OUT TO
RURAL AREAS.
HE IS USING THIS VISION OF A
REVITALIZED JAPAN TO SPEAK TO
PROBLEMS AND NEEDS RURAL.
THE BOJ IS LIMITED.
HE CONTINUES TO ADVOCATE THAT HE
HAS INFLUENCE AT HIS DISPOSAL.
ABLE BE PART OF THE MIX,
OBVIOUSLY.
I THINK THE ABE CAP THAT IS
FALLING BACK ON OLDER PATTERNS
AND THEY HAVE WALKED0 BACK FROM
THE CONSUMPTION TAX THAT WAS
ABOUT TO BE IMPOSED ON THE
JAPANESE CONSUMER.
THEY HAVE PUSHED THAT OFF FOR A
COUPLE OF YEARS.
SCARLET: SHINZO ABE HAS FAMOUSLY
PUSH FOR WOMENOMICS.
WHAT ARE THE ODDS THAT IN THE
NEXT CENTURY JAPAN WILL HAVE AN
EMPRESS INSTEAD OF AN EMPEROR AS
THE SYMBOLIC HEAD OF STATE?
SHEILA: THAT IS BEHIND THE
QUESTION OF HOW THE LAW OF THE
SECESSION PRONK -- SUCCESSION
PROCESS IS DEBATED ON THE FLOOR.
IN 2005 WE HAD A SIMILAR
SITUATION.
THE CROWN PRINCE AND PRINCESS
HAVE A DAUGHTER.
THEY WERE ADVISED ON A
SUCCESSION PROCESS, HOW TO
ADVANCE A STEADY POWER.
THEY RECOMMENDED FEMALE
SUCCESSION.
A FEW MONTHS LATER, THE CROWN
PRINCE AND HIS WIFE GAVE BIRTH
TO A SON.
IT WAS TABLED AND PUT OFF FOR
ANOTHER DAY.
THERE IS A LOT OF SPECULATION
THAT THERE WILL BE NOT JUST A
RESPONSE TO EMPEROR AKIHITO'S
REQUEST TO STEP DOWN, BUT A
BROADER LOOK AT SUCCESSION IT
SELF AND I THINK THE FEMALE
SUCCESSION QUESTION SCARLET:
WILL COME UP.
SCARLET:-- QUESTION WILL COME
UP.

SCARLET: DONALD TRUMP'S ECONOMIC
PLAN HAS NOT MENTIONED IN TITLE
AND.
SENIOR ECONOMIC ADVISER TOM
BARRICK SAYS THERE IS A REASON
FOR IT.
HE EXPLAINED TO ERIC SHATZER IN
AN EXCLUSIVE VIDEO.
TOM: ENTITLEMENTS ARE 67% OF THE
BUDGET.
INTERESTED A ON OUR DEFICIT IS
ANOTHER 7%.
DEFENSE IS 30% OR 14%.
THERE IS VERY LITTLE LEFT.
YOU LOOK AT ENTITLEMENTS, THAT
IS 67%.
YOU HAVE GOT TO MOVE IT.
WHY DOES NOBODY TALK ABOUT IT?
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC DOES NOT
WANT TO REDUCE ENTITLEMENTS.
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC STILL WANTS
MORE FOR LESS.
IT IS NOT THE AMERICAN WAY.
IT IS NOT THE SYSTEM THAT IS
FAILING, IT IS US THAT IS
FAILING.
WHY?
WE HAVE BUILT A PRISON IN WHICH
WE ARE THE PRISONERS.
WE TALK ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF
INTERIOR, DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY,
NONE OF US HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
THEY DO.
THE ALLOCATION OF REVENUES TO
ALL OF THESE MASSIVE DEPARTMENTS
ACROSS GOVERNMENT ARE HUMONGOUS.
IT IS NOT JUST A DISTRIBUTION TO
US OF WHAT WE SEE.
SOMEBODY HAS TO TAKE
ACCOUNTABILITY.
WHAT IS THAT BUDGET?
WHERE'S THE REVENUES GOING?
ERIC: WHICH IS PRECISELY WHY I
ASKED.
ISN'T THIS A CLARION CALL OR
DONALD TRUMP TO TAKE LEADERSHIP
ON ENTITLEMENT REFORM?
YET THERE IS NOT A WORD IN HIS
PLAN ABOUT ENTITLEMENT REFORM.
TOM: NOT YES.
WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS A ROLLING
OUT OF THE P -- NOT YET.
WHAT YOU SEE IS A ROLLING OUT OF
THE PIECES.
IT IS A WONDERFULLY POLITICALLY
EXCEPTED ACT.
ERIC: IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE A
DISRUPTOR -- PARDON ME AGAIN FOR
INTERRUPTING YOU -- WHAT IF YOU
ARE GOING TO BE A DISRUPTOR,
WHICH IS HOW YOU DESCRIBED THE
DONALD TRUMP CANDIDACY,
SHOULDN'T YOU WILLING TO BE
EMBRACING ADMITTEDLY UNTITLED --
ADMITTEDLY UNPOPULAR PLATFORMS
LIKE ENTITLEMENT REFORM?
TOM: I AGREE.
IT IS ABOUT DISMANTLING
BUREAUCRACIES THAT ARE IN PLACE
AND IT HAS TAKEN SOME TIME TO
ANNOUNCE IT.
YOU WILL SEE IT AND YOU ARE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
IT IS ALMOST 70% OF THE BUDGET.
JOE: THAT WAS TOM BARRICK.
SCARLET: COMING UP ON BLOOMBERG
TELEVISION, WE HAVE SAM SELLECK,
CEO OF BULLETIN ADDS.

KNOW TO GEAR UP FOR TOMORROW'S
