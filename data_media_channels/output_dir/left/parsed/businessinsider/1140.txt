Michelle
Michelle LaVon Robinson girl of the
Southside
for the fat for the past 25 years you
have not only been my wife and mother of
my children you have been my best friend
you took on a role you didn't ask for
and you made it your own with grace and
with grit and with style and good humor
you made the White House a place that
belongs to everybody
and a new generation sets its sights
higher because it has you as a role
model so you have made me proud and you
have made the country proud
