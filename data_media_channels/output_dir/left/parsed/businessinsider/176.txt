- I'm a guy who went to Russia
to run an investment fund,
I discovered corruption, I exposed it,
and I fell out with the regime.
(dramatic music)
- So we have a lot to talk about.
Over the last few days
we've seen some incredible,
incredible news from Russia and the UK,
all around the United States,
about violence at the
hands of Putin's regime
which you've experienced.
In the UK, a former Soviet
spy and his daughter
were attacked using a nerve
gas that we haven't seen
since World War II.
We have a ally of Boris
Berezovsky mysteriously killed.
And now we have new sanctions
against the Russian government
from the United States, UK, France.
Give us your take on this,
what should we expect to see
and what does this mean that
is going through Putin's head,
and what is happening in Russia right now?
- First of all, let's put
something in perspective.
Russia is at the headlines of
almost every different issue.
This is a country with an economy
the size of New York state
so this is not because
they're an economic superpower
that they're doing all this kind of stuff,
this is because Vladimir
Putin is effectively
the biggest criminal in the world.
He's a Mafia boss and
he's going around doing
Mafia techniques in
international relations
and he's gotten everybody's attention.
And part of the reason
he's doing this is that
he needs to distract everybody in Russia
from the problems that
are going on in Russia.
And so he's just poking
at every different thing
and creating all this
crisis and controversy.
- You spearheaded the Magnitsky
Act which some Russians,
I think, blame for part of
their economic situation.
Can you explain what you've
done, how you did it, and why?
- So first of all, who am I?
I'm a guy who went to Russia
to run an investment fund,
I discovered corruption, I exposed it,
and I fell out with the
regime and in retaliation
they kicked me out of the
country, they raided my offices,
they seized my investment
holding companies
and used them to steal 230
million dollars in taxes
that I paid to the Russian government.
A young lawyer named Sergei
Magnitsky discovered the crime,
exposed it and he was
subsequently arrested,
tortured for 358 days, and
killed at the age of 37
on November 16, 2009.
Since then, I've been on a
mission to get justice for Sergei
and that's led to a piece of legislation
here in the United States
called the Magnitsky Act,
which freezes the assets
and bans the visas of people
who killed Sergei and people
who do similar types of things.
The Magnitsky Act is now in
seven countries around the world
and Putin hates it with all of his heart.
Why does he hate it?
Because Putin has stolen
an enormous amount of money
and he's killed a lot of
people in the process.
And he understands, rightfully so,
that the money that he's
stolen which he keeps
in Western banks could be
seized under the Magnitsky Act.
And so as a result, he's
made it his single largest
foreign policy priority to
repeal the Magnitsky Act.
He stated that publicly.
- So why do Putin's cronies
hate Magnitsky so much?
- So normally when you go into government,
in a regular country, you
go in to serve the country
and serve the people of the country.
In Russia, people go into
government to effectively become
sub capos or Mafia bosses of
different areas of the economy,
and they steal an
enormous amount of money.
And every different government official is
spectacularly rich but as
much as they steal that money
in Russia they don't feel
comfortable keeping it in Russia.
They want to keep it in the West.
And because they keep it in the West,
all that money is exposed
and then the whole purpose
of going into government,
where they've spent all this
time and energy stealing
money and terrorizing people,
is all for naught, all that
hard work is for naught
if that money gets frozen.
And so for them...
And I should point out that
these people value money
over human life and therefore,
it's so crucial to them
that their money is safe
and if their money's not safe
then they feel very angry.
And they're particularly angry
at the guy who created the
Magnitsky Act to make their
money unsafe, which is me.
