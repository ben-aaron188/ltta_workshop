FIRST REPORTS OF A POSSIBLE 
ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION. 
BUT AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A 
IDENTIFY FEW MINUTES AGO, THERE 
IS A HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE 
THERE. 
THAT HAS BACKED UP TRAFFIC. 
GIVE ME ONE SECOND. 
I'M GOING TO PULL UP 
INFORMATION THAT I -- ABOUT 
ROAD CLOSURES. 
BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT THAT TIME 
WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE 
GETTING OFF WORK AND SOMETHING 
TO KNOW. 
POLICE ACTIVITY CLOSING DOWN 
THE HIGHWAY AND 178. 
THAT IS BECAUSE THIS IS AN 
ONGOING INVESTIGATION. 
POLICE ARE ON SCENE AFTER 
REPORTS OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER IN 
THE GAZETTE BUILDING. 
WE ARE WORKING TO CONFIRM A LOT 
OF DETAILS AT THIS POINT. 
THE INITIAL REPORTS THAT I HAVE 
HEARD FROM SOURCES AND AGAIN 
ARE STILL WORKING TO CONFIRM, 
THIS IS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 
SITUATION. 
ONE PERSON INSIDE WITH A 
SHOTGUN AND AS MANY AS FOUR 
VICTIMS. 
SO WE ARE STILL ON OUR WAY DOWN 
THERE. 
THERE'S A LOT OF UNANSWERED 
QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT THAT WE 
HOPE TO LEARN MORE FROM POLICE 
AS THEY'RE INVESTIGATION 
CONTINUES. 
AND AS SOON AS WE HAVE MORE 
INFORMATION, JESSICA, WE WILL 
ú 
>> THANK YOU, KIMBERLY. 
I ALSO WANT TO BRING UP WE'RE 
FOLLOWING BALTIMORE SUN IS OUR 
MEDIA PARTNER HERE AT WJZ. 
WE'RE FOLLOWING A NUMBER OF 
TWEETS. 
IT SAYS KEEP OUR COLLEAGUES IN 
YOUR THOUGHTS, PLEASE. 
EVERYBODY IS IN THE NEWS 
GATHERING PHASE AT THIS POINT. 
WE DON'T WANT TO REPORT 
ANYTHING INCORRECTLY BUT WE CAN 
VERIFY THERE WAS AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER, FOUR VICTIMS. 
>> WHAT WE CAN VERIFY IS WHAT 
POLICE HAVE TOLD US. 
INDEED AN ACTIVE SHOOTER. 
AS FAR AS WE KNOW, THE 
SITUATION HAS NOT BEEN 
CONTAINED. 
AS JESSICA MENTIONED WE GET A 
LOT OF OUR INFORMATION WHEN IT 
IS BREAKING THIS QUICKLY FROM 
TWITTER. 
AND WE DO HAVE TWEETS WE WILL 
SHARE WITH YOU. 
THE POLICE THEMSELVES -- HERE 
ARE SOME OF THEM. 
WE HAVE ANTHONY MESSENGER. 
HE IS AGAIN CONFIRMING ACTIVE 
SHOOTER AT BEST GATE BOULEVARD 
WHICH IS THE BUILDING THAT 
HOUSES THE CAPITAL GAZETTE. 
>> AND HE REPORTEDLY WAS AN 
INTERN INSIDE OF THE BUILDING. 
>> UH-HUH. 
>> SO HERE WE HAVE JUSTIN WHO 
SAYS THE BALTIMORE POLICE 
DEPARTMENT AT BALTIMORE SUN FOR 
PRECAUTIONARY SWEEP BECAUSE THE 
SUN OPENS THE CAPITAL GAZETTE 
YOU FORM A CONCLUSION THIS 
COULD HAVE TO DO WITH 
NEWSPAPERS. 
CODY, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
BUILDING IS ON LOCKDOWN. 
THERE IS NO ACTIVE THREAT IN 
BALTIMORE AS FAR AS I KNOW. 
POLICE ARE DOING THE RIGHT 
THING, BEING EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS 
BECAUSE THERE IS INDEED AN 
ACTIVE SHOOTER AT THE CAPITAL 
GAZETTE BUILDING AND IT HOUSES 
A NEWSPAPER, IT ONLY MAKES 
SENSE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 
BALTIMORE SUN IS CONTAINED. 
THE SUN SAYS INVESTIGATING 
REPORTS OF AN INCIDENT AT THE 
CAPITAL GAZETTE BUILDING AND 
THEY TOO WILL SHARE DETAILS 
WHEN THEY ARE CONFIRMED. 
THE ONLY WAY WE CAN CONFIRM 
INFORMATION IS THROUGH THE 
POLICE AND THE OFFICIALS WHO 
ARE IN CHARGE OF THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
BUT SADLY WE DO KNOW THERE HAVE 
BEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
INJURED. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> THE CONDITIONS OF THOSE 
PEOPLE WE DON'T KNOW. 
>> RIGHT. 
WE SAW THE MEDEVAC HELICOPTERS. 
WE WILL TRY TO GET THE VIDEO OF 
PEOPLE WALKING OUT OF THE 
CAPITAL GAZETTE BUILDING IN 
ANNAPOLIS ARE THEIR HANDS UP. 
THEY ARE BEING EVACUATED. 
ALSO REPORTS THAT S.W.A.T. 
WAS TRYING TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF 
THE BUILDING AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE. 
WE HAD PRELIMINARY REPORTS 
SAYING THAT THERE MAY BE ONE 
GUNMAN. 
AT THIS POINT, AGAIN, NOT 
CONFIRMED. 
WE'RE WAITING FOR THAT 
INFORMATION AS WELL. 
>> I'M SURE IN A BUILDING OF 
THAT SIZE, UNTIL THE POLICE 
HAVE ABSOLUTELY CONTAINED THE 
SITUATION, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO 
JUMP TO ANY CONCLUSIONS ABOUT 
HOW MANY SHOOTERS, ET CETERA. 
THEY'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING, 
EMPTYING THE BUILDING OF 
EVERYTHING THAT THEY CAN EMPTY 
IT OF. 
MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS 
OKAY AND ARE OUT AND REMAIN 
OKAY AND SWEEPING THE BUILDING. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> ONCE AGAIN THE TWITTER FEEDS 
THAT WE JUST SAW SHOW THAT 
POLICE ARE RESPONDING JUST TO 
MAKE SURE THAT THIS ISN'T TO DO 
WITH THE NEWSPAPER OR A 
REACTION TO THE PRINT MEDIA. 
>> TODAY HAS BEEN A VERY, VERY 
BUSY DAY WITH BALTIMORE NEWS. 
THIS IS A SHOT FROM EARLIER 
FROM THE CHOPPER SHOWING THE 
EMERGENCY VEHICLES. 
AGAIN, WE DO HAVE REPORT THAT'S 
THERE MAY BE STILL QUITE A FEW 
VICTIMS. 
WE SAW THE MEDEVAC HELICOPTERS 
AND IT WAS UNCLEAR WHERE THEY 
WERE HEADED. 
OFTEN THEY ARE BROUGHT HERE TO 
SHOCK TRAUMA BECAUSE THEY'RE 
EQUIP TODAY HANDLE EMERGENCIES 
SUCH AS THIS. 
WE HAVE ALSO COVERED 
EXTENSIVELY HOW SO MANY 
HOSPITALS IN MARYLAND HAVE GONE 
TO EXTRA TRAINING TO LEARN HOW 
TO HANDLE A MASS CASUALTY 
SITUATION. 
FORTUNATELY AT THIS POINT IT IS 
NOT THERE. 
BUT THEY ARE PREPARED TO HANDLE 
A SHOOTING OR MULTIPLE 
SHOOTINGS. 
>> INDEED. 
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MEDICAL 
INSTITUTIONS IN THE AREA THAT 
CAN HANDLE AN EMERGENCY LIKE 
THIS. 
AS YOU SAID SHOCK TRAUMA WOULD 
BE THE NATURAL PLACE FOR THEM 
TO BE MEDEVACED. 
THERE ARE AMBULANCES. 
YOU SEE THAT FIRE ENGINES HAVE 
RESPONDED. 
YOU SEE POLICE OBVIOUSLY 
RESPONDING. 
UNTIL THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS 
GOING ON, THEY'RE GOING TO SEND 
EVERY RESOURCE THAT THEY HAVE 
TO THE SITUATION. 
>> ALSO HEADED THAT WAY, 
KIMBERLY EATON. 
WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO YOU. 
YOU WERE TEN MINUTES OUT. 
I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE 
YOUR WAY TOWARDS THE STAGING 
AREA. 
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING AND 
HEARING? 
>> Reporter: WELL, WE'RE STILL 
ABOUT FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES 
OUT. 
THINK POINT WE CAN SEE THE 
HELICOPTERS CIRCLING. 
WE HEARD REPORTS THAT THE 
POLICE HAD THEIR HELICOPTERS UP 
OVER THE SCENE. 
THEY ARE REALLY ON THE GROUND, 
IN THE AIR. 
THEY ARE AT THIS WITH ALL THEIR 
RESOURCES. 
WE HAVE SEEN A FEW POLICE CARS 
COME BY US. 
SO THEY ARE STILL SENDING 
OFFICERS LIGHTS AND SIRENS TO 
THIS ACTIVE AND ONGOING 
INVESTIGATION. 
WE ALSO ARE HEADED RIGHT NOW TO 
A MEDIA STAGING AREA WHERE WE 
ARE HOPING TO GET MORE 
INFORMATION. 
AT THIS POINT WE ARE SEEING A 
LOT OF PEOPLE TAKING PICTURES 
AND VIDEOS WHERE THIS HAPPENED. 
JUST THE MASSIVE POLICE 
RESPONSE TO THIS. 
AND WE HAVE HEARD THAT THERE 
ARE POSSIBLY SEVERAL VICTIMS 
INVOLVED HERE. 
I HAVE HEARD FROM A SOURCE, 
STILL UNCONFIRMED, WE ARE ON 
OUR WAY TO THE SCENE TO CONFIRM 
THIS, THERE WAS ONE PERSON 
INSIDE OF THE BUILDING WITH A 
SHOTGUN. 
AS MIKE HAD MENTIONED EARLIER, 
THERE ARE SO MANY UNANSWERED 
QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MOTIVE 
IS HERE. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHY TODAY, WHY 
THIS LOCATION OR REALLY A LOT 
OF THE DETAILS OF WHAT EXACTLY 
UNFOLDED IN THESE MINUTES, 
THESE TERRIFYING MINUTES INSIDE 
OF THIS BUILDING ABOUT AN HOUR 
AGO. 
BUT WE ARE HOPING TO LEARN 
MORE. 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE ARE LOW 
ON THE LIST OF PEOPLE TO GET 
INFORMATION. 
THE POLICE HAVE LARGER -- 
LARGER ISSUES TO DEAL WITH. 
>> WE HAVE LEARNED SO FAR THERE 
IS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION 
RIGHT NOW IN ANNAPOLIS AT THE 
CAPITAL GAZETTE BUILDING, A 
LOCAL NEWSPAPER OWNED BY THE 
BALTIMORE SUN. 
POLICE ARE AT THE SCENE. 
THEY HAVE CALLED THE SITUATION 
ACTIVE AND ONGOING. 
THERE ARE REPORTS THAT POLICE 
OFFICERS ARE CURRENTLY 
SEARCHING THE BUILDING. 
LET'S B 
SECURITY CORRESPONDENT JEFF WHO 
IS IN WASHINGTON. 
>> YEAH. 
YOU CAN SEE ADRIANA FROM THESE 
CHOPPER PICTURES THAT THERE IS 
AN ONGOING RESPONSE THERE. 
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH 
LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCES WHO SAY 
THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO GET UP 
TO SPEED ON THIS SITUATION. 
WE KNOW THAT THE ATF IS 
RESPONDING. 
WE KNOW THAT THE FBI WON'T BE 
FAR BEHIND. 
I TALKED TO A LAW ENFORCEMENT 
SOURCE THERE IN AINSPECT POLICE 
A FEW -- IN ANNAPOLIS WHO SAY 
THEY ARE HEADING INTO THE 
EMERGENCY OPERATION CENTER. 
CLEARLY THIS IS AN ONGOING 
SITUATION. 
THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO ASSESS 
THE EXTENT OF ANY INJURIES. 
THERE ARE REPORTS RIGHT NOW 
THAT WE HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THAT 
THERE ARE INJURIES. 
WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OF 
THOSE INJURIES. 
AND MY SOURCES ARE TELLING ME 
THAT THEY DON'T KNOW EITHER. 
THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO GET A 
GRIP ON THE SITUATION THAT IS 
UNFOLDING RIGHT NOW. 
WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT THIS IS 
AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION 
THAT THEY ARE RESPONDING TO. 
RESPONDING TO THIS CAPITAL 
GAZETTE BUILDING IN ANNAPOLIS. 
THERE ARE PEOPLE EVACUATING THE 
BUILDING. 
THERE IS A LARGE POLICE 
PRESENCE HERE. 
SO CLEARLY THIS IS A SITUATION 
THAT IS ONGOING. 
>> JEFF, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US 
ABOUT POTENTIAL TARGETS FOR 
THIS KIND OF SHOOTING? 
AND HOW PREPARED OR UNPREPARED 
A NEWSPAPER MIGHT BE? 
>> IT'S TOO EARLY TO SPECULATE 
ON ANY POTENTIAL TARGETS. 
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THIS IS 
SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY HAS 
BECOME ALL TOO FAMILIAR TO 
AMERICANS AND TO BUSINESSES 
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SOME 
BUSINESSES DRILL FOR. 
WE KNOW THAT SCHOOLS DRILL FOR 
THIS. 
SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE 
SITUATIONS THAT WE ARE SEEING 
MORE AND MORE IN THIS COUNTRY. 
AND YOU SEE HERE PEOPLE BEING 
EVACUATED FROM THE BUILDING. 
THEY HAVE THEIR ARMS STRETCHED 
IN THE AIR. 
THAT IS PROTOCOL IN SWAYINGS 
LIKE THIS. 
BECAUSE AS PEOPLE COME OUT, 
INVESTIGATORS DON'T KNOW WHO IS 
FRIEND OR WHO IS FAUX. 
SO THEY TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT 
THE ENVIRONMENT IS SECURE BY 
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE EXITING 
THE BUILDING HAVE THEIR HANDS 
UP. 
WE HAVE HEARD IN THE PAST OF 
ACTIVE SHOOTERS ESCAPING FROM A 
SHOOTING SITUATION BY WALKING 
OUT WITH THE PEOPLE BEING 
EVACUATED. 
IN FACT THAT HAPPENED IN 
PARKLAND, FOR EXAMPLE. 
AND SO THIS IS STANDARD 
OPERATING PROCEDURE. 
THE IMAGES THAT YOU SEE THERE 
ON YOUR SCREEN OF PEOPLE BEING 
EVACUATED WITH THEIR HANDS UP, 
THAT IS WHAT YOU DO IN 
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. 
THAT IS WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS 
TRAINED TO DO. 
AND SO WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE 
IS SORT OF A STANDARD RESPONSE 
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. 
AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE 
NOW DRILL FOR ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY. 
>> IT IS A CHILLING SCENE TO 
SEE THOSE PEOPLE WALKING OUT 
WITH THEIR HANDS UP. 
WE HAVE SEEN THAT OVER AND OVER 
AGAIN AS THESE ACTIVE SHOOTERS 
HAVE UNFOLDED IN WORKPLACES AND 
SCHOOLS. 
TOO MANY OF THEM. 
WE JUST GOT WORD THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN BRIEFED ON 
THE SHOOTING AND HE SAYS OUR 
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH 
ALL THAT ARE AFFECTED. 
JEFF, TALK TO US BUT HOW 
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, ALL THE WAY UP, 
UNO OWE THE CHAIN OF GOVERNMENT 
ARE RESPONDING TO THIS. 
AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING FROM THE 
LOCAL LEVEL TO THE FBI TO 
PEOPLE ABOVE THAT. 
>> WHAT THEY KNOW IS THE BEST 
AY TO RESPOND TO A  
LIKE THIS IS TO DO IT IN A 
COORDINATED FASHION. 
SURE, THEY DON'T WASTE ANY 
TIME. 
LOCAL POLICE GET THERE AS FAST 
AS THEY CAN AND MOVE IN AS FAST 
AS THEY CAN. 
AT LEAST THAT IS THE PRACTICE. 
BUT WHAT YOU ALSO HAVE IS THE 
RESPONSE FROM THE FEDERAL 
AGENCIES. 
YOU HAVE THE ATF. 
THEY ARE RESPONDING TO THE 
SCENE. 
YOU HAVE THE FBI LOCALLY THERE. 
THEY ARE RESPONDING TO THE 
SCENE. 
BECAUSE WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT 
THE COORDINATED RESPONSE IS THE 
BEST RESPONSE. 
I HAVE JUST GOTTEN SOME NEW 
INFORMATION. 
CBS NEWS' TWO SOURCES REPORTING 
NOW THAT THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE 
DEAD. 
SO THAT IS NEW INFORMATION THAT 
WE HAVE. 
WE HAVE HEARD THAT THERE ARE 
INJURIES AND NOW WE'RE HEARING 
THAT THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE 
DEAD. 
AGAIN, THIS IS STILL AN EARLY 
DEVELOPING STORY. 
AND SOMETIMES IN SITUATIONS 
LIKE THESE YOU GET INACCURATE 
INFORMATION. 
WHICH IS WHY WE TRY TO GET TWO 
SOURCES ON THIS. 
WHICH -- AND THESE SOURCES ARE 
TELLING US THAT THERE ARE AT 
LEAST TWO PEOPLE DEAD. 
AS I SAID EARLIER, LAW 
ENFORCEMENT THERE LOCALLY, 
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET A HANDLE 
ON THE SITUATION. 
THERE IS NO INFORMATION RIGHT 
NOW TO SUGGEST THAT ANYONE IS 
IN CUSTODY. 
SO THAT IS OBVIOUSLY A PRIORITY 
FOR INVESTIGATORS. 
>> JEFF WE'RE GOING TO LET YOU 
GET BACK TO WORKING YOUR 
SOURCES. 
THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION. 
>>> JUST TO WRAP UP WHAT WE 
HAVE LEARNED SO FAR, JEFF JUST 
TOLD US THAT HIS SOURCES TELL 
HIM, TWO SOURCES, THAT FOUR 
PEOPLE ARE DEAD AT THE SCENE. 
THIS IS AN ACTIVE SHOOTING 
INVESTIGATION AT THE CAPITAL 
GAZETTE BUILDING IN ANNAPOLIS, 
MARYLAND. 
WE HAVE SEEN THE PICTURES OF 
PEOPLE BEING RUSHED OUT OF THE 
BUILDING WITH THEIR HANDS UP. 
WE SEE VIDEO OF LAW ENFORCEMENT 
AT THE SCENE. 
WE SAW PEOPLE BEING EVACUATED 
BY HELICOPTER. 
SO THAT WOULD INDICATE THERE 
ARE ALSO PEOPLE WHO WERE 
INJURED. 
NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
-- WHO HAVE PASSED AWAY. 
LET'S TAKE YOU BACK NOW TO OUR 
BALTIMORE STATION WJZ. 
>> ON HIM OR HER. 
AND SO POLICE CONTINUE TO COMB 
THAT BUILDING DESPITE THE FACT 
THAT THE PEOPLE INSIDE HAVE 
BEEN EVACUATED FOR THE MOST 
PART. 
>> SO IT APPEARS AS THOUGH 
SOMEBODY WENT INTO THE CAPITAL 
GAZETTE. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> IT WASN'T JUST IN THE 
BUILDING. 
IT APPEARS FROM THE REPORTER 
WHO TWEETED THAT OUT, REPORTS 
THERE THAT THERE WAS A SHOOTING 
IN THE NEWS ROOM. 
IT ALSO APPEARS THAT THERE WERE 
INJURIES. 
>> ALSO WE'RE HEARING FROM 
MARYLAND POLITICIANS, CHRIS VAN 
HAHN, MY HEART IS WITH THE 
FAMILIES FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES 
OF THE VICTIMS AS WE LEARN MORE 
ABOUT THIS TERRIBLE SITUATION. 
WE MUST UNITE TO END THE 
VIOLENCE. 
BROWN SAYS I AM CLOSELY 
FOLLOWING THE INFORMATION FROM 
THE GAZETTE. 
>> WE DO HAVE ONE SOURCE WHO IS 
A RELIABLE SOURCE WHO IS 
TELLING WJZ THAT AS MIKE 
MENTIONED, ONE SUSPECT IS IN 
CUSTODY. 
NOW, OF COURSE POLICE HAVE TO 
MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO OTHER 
SUSPECTS AT LOOSE IN THAT 
BUILDING. 
SO THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE 
THAT HE WORKED ALONE OR SHE 
WORKED ALONE BY COMBING EVERY 
INCH OF THAT BUILDING. 
AND PEOPLE ARE SHELTERING IN 
PLACE. 
THOSE WHO CANNOT GET OUT. 
THOSE WHO CAN GET OUT, WE HAVE 
BEEN WITNESSING ARE WALKING OUT 
WITH THEIR HANDS UP TRYING TO 
EVACUATE. 
>> IN CASE YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR 
WITH THE CAPITAL GAZETTE, THEY 
ARE OWNED BY THE BALTIMORE SUN. 
THE SUN WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO 
CONFIRM THAT MULTIPLE PEOPLE 
HAD BEEN SHOT INSIDE OF THE 
BUILDING. 
REPORTERS FROM THE SUN POSTING 
ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT THEY'RE 
WISHING THEIR COLLEAGUES WELL 
AND HOPING THAT EVERYONE IS 
OKAY. 
ALSO LOCAL GOVERNMENT SAYING TO 
AVOID THE AREA AROUND ANNAPOLIS 
MALL UNLESS YOU WERE INVOLVED. 
IN THAT CASE YOU'RE BEING URGE 
TODAY GO TO THE LORD & TAYLOR 
TO REUNITE. 
FIRE IS WORKING AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER SITUATION. 
THEY STILL ARE CALLING IT AN 
ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION. 
SO, AGAIN, THEY'RE ALSO ASKING 
PEOPLE IF YOU DO LIVE IN THAT 
AREA, STAY INSIDE AS WE WORK TO 
GATHER MORE INFORMATION. 
>> THIS IS A CBS NEWS SPECIAL 
REPORT. 
I'M REPORTING FROM CBS 
HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK. 
THERE HAS BEEN A DEADLY 
SHOOTING AT A NEWSPAPER OFFICE 
IN ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND. 
THE CAPITAL GAZETTE. 
WE ARE FOLLOWING IT AT THIS 
HOUR. 
FOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED, 
WE ARE TOLD. 
A SUSPECT IS NOW IN CUSTODY. 
THE GAZETTE IS OWNED BY THE 
BALTIMORE SUN MEDIA GROUP. 
POLICE ARE NOW AT THE SCENE OF 
THAT SHOOTING AT THE GAZETTE. 
WE'RE TOLD THEY'RE ALSO AT THE 
OFFICES OF THE PARENT 
NEWSPAPER, THE BALTIMORE SUN. 
YOU'RE SEEING THE SCENE RIGHT 
NOW. 
JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT JEFF IS 
WORKING HIS SOURCES AND 
FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS FROM 
INSIDE OUR WASHINGTON, D.C. 
NEWS ROOM. 
JEFF, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US 
ABOUT THIS SHOOTING AT THE 
CAPITAL GAZETTE RIGHT NOW. 
>> OBVIOUSLY, JEFF, WE'RE STILL 
EARLY ON IN THIS INVESTIGATION. 
BUT THE GOOD NEWS FOR 
INVESTIGATORS IS THEY HAVE A 
SUSPECT IN CUSTODY. 
YOU JUST REPORTED THAT. 
SO THAT IS INFORMATION THAT HAS 
BEEN CONFIRMED. 
YOU SEE IN THESE IMAGES PEOPLE 
BEING EVACUATED FROM THAT 
BUILDING. 
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN 
ONGOING FOR THE LAST SEVERAL 
MINUTES OR SO. 
AS INVESTIGATORS GET ON THE 
SCENE AND SORT OUT WHO IS 
FRIEND FROM FAUX. 
WHAT WE KNOW IS ONE PERSON IS 
IN CUSTODY. 
FOUR PEOPLE ARE CONFIRMED DEAD. 
CREDIT THERE ARE ANY OTHER 
INJURIES, WE DON'T KNOW THAT. 
INVESTIGATORS ON THE LOCAL AND 
FEDERAL LEVEL ARE STILL GETTING 
UP TO SPEED HERE. 
WE KNOW THE ATF AND FBI ARE 
RESPONDING, ALONG WITH LOCAL 
POLICE THERE IN THE ANNAPOLIS 
AREA. 
I WAS TOLD BY A SOURCE THAT 
CITY OFFICIALS ARE MOVING IN OR 
HAVE MOVED INTO EMERGENCY 
OPERATIONS CENTER AS THEY DEAL 
WITH THIS UNFOLDING TRAGEDY. 
JEFF. 
>> ALL RIGHT, JEFF, THANKS VERY 
MUCH. 
WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE 
TWEETS OF AN INTERN ACTUALLY 
INSIDE OF THAT BUILDING AT THE 
CAPITAL GAZETTE. 
AND SHE TWEETED OR THERE WAS A 
TWEET SAYING HELP US. 
THE CAPITAL GAZETTE AND THE 
BALTIMORE SUN MEDIA GROUP IS 
ONE OF THE OLDEST PUBLISHERS IN 
THE COUNTRY. 
AS WE MENTIONED OWNED BY THE 
BALTIMORE SUN MEDIA GROUP. 
POLICE ARE ALSO AT THE 
BALTIMORE SUN AT THIS HOUR THEY 
-- AT THIS POINT WE HAVE GOTTEN 
NO SPECIFIC THREATS OF ANYONE 
AT THE SUN BUT SINCE THIS 
SHOOTING APPEARS TO HAVE 
HAPPENED INSIDE A NEWSPAPER 
OFFICE, THAT'S WHY THEY'RE 
BEING A LITTLE CAUTIOUS ABOUT 
THAT RIGHT NOW. 
WE SHOULD REMIND FOLKS THAT THE 
SHOOTER WE ARE BEING TOLD RIGHT 
NOW BY POLICE IS IN CUSTODY. 
BUT THE LATEST IS IN ANNAPOLIS, 
MARYLAND. 
WE'RE TOLD FOUR ARE DEAD AFTER 
A SHOOTING AT THE CAPITAL 
GAZETTE, WHICH IS A NEWSPAPER 
IN THAT AREA. 
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP FOLLOWING 
THIS STORY THIS AFTERNOON. 
WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE ABOUT 
THIS ON YOUR LOCAL NEWS ON THIS 
CBS STATION, ON OUR 24 HOURS 
NEWS SERVICE, CBSN. 
AND OF COURSE TONIGHT ON THE 
CBS EVENING NEWS. 
AS WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THIS 
SHOOTING IN MARYLAND, FOR NOW 
CBS NEWS IN NEW YORK. 
 NOW,.
>> FOR NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY, GO 
TO CBSNEWS.COM. 
>>> THAT WAS THE CBS NEWS 
SPECIAL REPORT ON AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER SITUATION IN ANNAPOLIS, 
MARYLAND. 
WE ARE TOLD IT IS UNFOLDING AT 
THE CAPITAL GAZETTE BUILDING IN 
ANNAPOLIS. 
PEOPLE ARE BEING ESCORTED OUT 
OF THE BUILDING WITH THEIR 
HANDS UP. 
CHILLING IMAGES THAT WE HAVE 
SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN 
THERE ARE SHOOTINGS AT PLACES 
OF WORK, AT SCHOOLS. 
WE STILL ARE COLLECTING 
INFORMATION. 
BUT WHAT CBS NEWS HAS CONFIRMED 
IS THAT THERE IS ONE SUSPECT IN 
CUSTODY AND THAT FOUR PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN KILLED. 
FOUR PEOPLE. 
WE ALSO HAVE A TWEET FROM 
SOMEONE WHO SAYS THAT THEY ARE 
AN INTERN AT THE CAPITAL 
GAZETTE. 
LET'S BRING THAT UP. 
IT SAYS ACTIVE SHOOTER. 
888 BESTGATE. 
THAT'S THE ROAD. 
PLEASE HELP US. 
A CHILLING MESSAGE FROM SOMEONE 
WHO SAYS THAT THEY WERE INSIDE 
THAT BUILDING. 
AND THAT WAS RETWEETED MANY 
TIMES TO SPREAD THE WORD 
PRESUMABLY. 
LET'S BRING IN PAUL VIOLIS. 
I JUST SAW YOU WORKING THE 
PHONE TO GET INFORMATION ON 
THIS. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED. 
>> IT APPEARS THAT THE BOMB 
SQUAD IS ALSO ATTEMPTING TO 
CLEAR A PACKAGE THAT WAS LEFT 
IN THE BUILDING BY SOMEONE THAT 
THEY HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED AS OF 
YET RIGHT NOW. 
THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS GOING 
ON RIGHT NOW. 
THE OUTER PERIMETER HAS BEEN 
SET. 
THE INNER PERIMETER HAS BEEN 
SET. 
THEY'RE TRYING TO VERIFY THEY 
ONLY HAVE ONE SHOOTER WHICH IS 
VERY IMPORTANT. 
IT APPEARS THERE WAS ONLY ONE. 
THEY'RE STILL VERIFYING THAT. 
WHICH MEANS FOR OUR VIEWERS 
THEY'RE LOOKING AT VIDEO TAPE 
AND USING ARTIFICIAL 
INTELLIGENCE THAT WILL ANALYZE 
THE ENTIRE CAMPUS TO ASCERTAIN 
WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ONLY ONE 
PERSON. 
IF THERE IS, THEY HAVE A GUY IN 
CUSTODY RIGHT NOW. 
THE BIG THICK IS THAT THERE IS 
STILL A PACKAGE WHICH IS WHY 
THEY'RE CLEARING THE BUILDING. 
IN A METHODICAL WAY. 
THEY'RE NOT SURE IF THAT DEVICE 
RIGHT NOW IS IN FACT AN 
EXPLOSIVE DEVICE. 
>> AND THE ATF IS RESPONDING TO 
THIS, THAT THEY'RE THE ONE 
THAT'S WILL BE WORKING ON 
CLEARING THAT PACKAGE. 
WHEN YOU SAY THEY'RE USING 
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO 
ANALYZE VIDEO, WHAT DO YOU MEAN 
BY THAT. 
>> THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION. 
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THERE IS 
SOFTWARE THAT IS BUILT INTO THE 
CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION 
CAMERAS THAT YOU SEE AROUND THE 
CAMPUS. 
WHAT THAT ALLOWS -- WHAT THAT 
ALLOWS POLICE AND LAW 
úENFORCEM 
IS FOR CAMERAS TO THINK AND TO 
LEARN AND TO REMEMBER. 
SO THEY CAN FEED AT THAT CAMERA 
INFORMATION OR THE SERVER 
ATTACHED TO THE CAMERA 
INFORMATION TO SAY HAVE YOU 
SEEN THIS PERSON? 
AND THAT WILL RELATE TO ANY 
TIME THAT THAT PERSON HAS BEEN 
EVEN CLOSE OR IN VIEW OF ANY OF 
THOSE CAMERAS OR ANYBODY RELATE 
TODAY THAT. 
DID HE DRIVE ON CAMPUS? 
WAS THERE ANOTHER PERSON WITH 
THAT PERSON. 
HOW MANY VEHICLES WERE 
INVOLVED. 
WHERE DID THEY COME FROM, ET 
CETERA. 
THAT HELPS US IN THE 
INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS. 
>> IT IS A WAY TO SCAN SECURITY 
VIDEO IN A FAST WAY RATHER THAN 
SITTING AND WATCHING IT ALL IN 
REAL TIME. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
BASICALLY WHAT IT DOES IS 
ALLOWS US TO DO IN MINUTES OR 
SECONDS WHAT USE TODAY TAKE 
HOURS OR DAYS. 
>> TALK TO US ABOUT THIS KIND 
OF WORKPLACE. 
THIS IS A NEWSPAPER 
ORGANIZATION. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU 
ABOUT WHAT KIND OF SITUATION 
THIS MIGHT BE? 
>> IT IS A GREAT QUESTION TOO. 
I THINK REALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT 
THIS THE PROBABILITY OF RISK AS 
WE BREAK THIS DOWN FROM THE 
BEHAVIOR SENSE IS ONE OF TWO 
THINGS. 
IT WILL BE AN EMPLOYEE OR A 
DISGRUNTLED EX-EMPLOYEE OR IT 
WILL BE SOMEONE WHO IS IN SOME 
WAY SHAPE OR FORM RELATED TO 
SOMETHING THAT THE NEWSPAPER 
HAS PRINTED THAT FEELS ANGRY OR 
SOME LEVEL OF DISDAIN TOWARDS 
SOMETHING THAT THE NEWSPAPER 
HAS REPRESENTED. 
SO IT IS GOING TO BE -- IN ALL 
LIKELIHOOD, IT WOULD BE ONE OF 
THE TWO THINGS. 
CAN'T LEAVE OUT THE FACT THAT 
IT COULD ALSO 
THERE IS INFORMATION TO 
VALIDATE THAT, THEN WE WOULDN'T 
EVEN LOOK AT THAT AT THIS 
POINT. 
>> WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF 
REPORTING ON LOCKDOWNS. 
SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID 
REMINDED ME OF SOMETHING THAT I 
LEARNED FROM AN INSTRUCTOR THAT 
DOES LOCKDOWNS AT SCHOOLS. 
WHEN YOU SEE ONE SHOOTER, THINK 
THAT THERE ARE TWO. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
>> YOU ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE 
SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND NEVER 
PUT YOUR GUARD DOWN, EVEN IF 
THAT ONE SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY. 
>> RIGHT. 
AND THAT KEY -- THAT IS THE KEY 
PHRASE TO SITUATIONAL 
AWARENESS. 
NEVER ASSUME THERE IS ONE. 
AND SO MANY TIMES WHEN WE HAVE 
COVERED THESE THINGS TOGETHER, 
SO MANY PEOPLE WILL ASSUME THAT 
THERE'S ONE PERSON, THERE IS 
ONLY ONE PERSON. 
THAT IS WHERE THE ARTIFICIAL 
INTELLIGENCE, THAT'S WHERE 
EXAMINING THE MEANS OF 
GATHERING INTELLIGENCE THAT WE 
HAVE AVAILABLE TO US TODAY 
ENABLES US TO ASCERTAIN 
EXPEDITIOUSLY WAS THERE MORE 
THAN ONE PERSON AND IN FACT 
WHERE DID THEY COME FROM. 
>> OF COURSE YOU DON'T KNOW 
WHAT THE SECURITY LEVEL IS AT 
THIS NEWSPAPER. 
BUT HOW MUCH OF A SOFT TARGET 
IS THIS. 
>> IT IS A BIG SOFT TARGET. 
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. 
I HATE TO SAY THAT. 
I DON'T WANT TO CAST ASPERSIONS 
ABOUT THAT. 
BUT WHEN YOU LEAVE MANHATTAN, 
EVEN GOING TO THE SUBURBS, 
LEVELS OF SECURITY WITH RESPECT 
TO ACCESS CONTROL FOR 
COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS 
DIMINISHES. 
AS YOU GET FURTHER AND FURTHER 
AWAY FROM NEW YORK, IT GETS 
LESS AND LESS. 
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 
SECURITY IS FOR THIS BUILDING. 
BUT SUFFICE IT TO SAY, THIS IS 
BUILDING TO BE EXAMINED IF THE 
PERSON ACTUALLY GOT IN THE 
BUILDING. 
AND IF THEY DID, HOW DID THEY 
GET INTO THE BUILDING? 
THROUGH THE FRONT? 
DID THEY HAVE TO SHOW ID? 
WERE THEY ESCORTED. 
ALL OF THESE THINGS WILL COME 
INTO ACCOUNT WHEN WE PEEL THIS 
BACK AFTER TO SEE HOW THIS 
TRANSPIRED. 
>> PAUL, WE JUST GOT TWEETS 
FROM A REPORTER WHO WAS IN THE 
ROOM. 
THIS REPORTER PHIL DAVIS SAYS 
THERE IS NOTHING MORE 
TERRIFYING THAN HEARING 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE GOT SHOT WHILE 
YOU'RE UNDER YOUR DESK. 
AND THEN HEAR THE GUNMAN 
RELOAD. 
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE. 
WHAT A TERRIFYING MOMENT FOR 
EVERYONE IN THAT ROOM. 
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE LOSS FOR 
THOSE THAT LOST THEIR LIVES. 
>> IT IS LIFE-CHANGING. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
>> THIS PERSON ALSO TWEETED 
GUNMAN SHOT THROUGH THE GLASS 
DOOR TO THE OFFICE AND OPENED 
FIRE ON MULTIPLE EMPLOYEES. 
CAN'T SAY MUCH MORE AND DON'T 
WANT TO DECLARE ANYONE DEAD. 
WE DO KNOW THERE ARE FOUR 
PEOPLE DEAD. 
LET'S BRING IN CBS NEWS JUSTICE 
AND HOMELAND SECURITY 
CORRESPONDENT JEFF IN 
WASHINGTON. 
HE HAS BEEN SPEAKING TO HIS 
SOURCES. 
WHAT IS THE LATEST THAT YOU 
HAVE LEARNED. 
>> RELATIVELY EARLY ON YOU HAVE 
THIS REPORT THAT THERE IS 
SOMEONE IN CUSTODY. 
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PERSON, HE 
OR SHE, THE PERSON WHO IS IN 
CUSTODY, IS STILL ALIVE. 
AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE A 
SITUATION LIKE THIS, THIS IS 
SOMEONE OBVIOUSLY WHO CAN 
PROVIDE INVESTIGATORS WITH THE 
INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED. 
THAT SAID, THIS IS STILL VERY 
MUCH AN ONGOING SITUATION. 
INVESTIGATORS TYPICALLY IN 
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS, THEY HAVE 
TO CLEAR THE BUILDING AND MAKE 
SURE THAT THERE ARE NO 
SECONDARY THREATS. 
WHETHER THAT BE SOME SORT OF A 
DEVICE OR SOME OTHER THREAT. 
YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT IS 
SOMETHING THAT IS HAPPENING 
RIGHT NOW. 
>> THAT SHOULD SOMETHING THAT 
CAN HAPPEN WITHIN THE NEXT 12 
TO 24 HOURS. 
AND THEN YOU HAVE THE FBI WHO 
WILL OBVIOUSLY HELP SEARCHING 
DAYS ABASES, THINGS LIKE THAT 
TO GATHER AS MUCH INFORMATION. 
AS INVESTIGATORS SEARCH FOR A 
MOTIVE. 
BECAUSE THAT IS THE QUESTION 
HERE. 
YOU HAVE THIS BUILDING THAT 
HOUSES THIS LOCAL PAPER, THE 
CAPITAL GAZETTE TARGETED HERE. 
THE QUESTION AS YOU HAVE 
DISCUSSED, ADRIANA, IF THIS IS 
SOMEONE WHO HAD A GRIEVANCE 
AGAINST THIS PAPER OR THIS IS 
SOMEONE WHO FOR WHATEVER REASON 
HAS NO CONNECTION TO THE PAPER 
BUT TARGETED THE PAPER ON THIS 
DAY. 
THE FACT THAT THIS PERSON WAS 
INSIDE THE BUILDING OBVIOUSLY 
GIVEN SECURITY THESE DAYS 
RAISES ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS 
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT TYPE OF 
ACCESS MAY HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE 
TO THIS PERSON. 
WAS THIS SOMEONE WHO WORKED 
THERE OR HAD SOME SORT OF 
CONNECTION THERE. 
THESE ARE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE 
DISCUSSED THAT INVESTIGATORS 
ARE GOING OVER RIGHT NOW AS 
WELL. 
AND IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THAT, 
YOU HAVE THE RESPONSE FOR THE 
LOCAL COMMUNITY THERE. 
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN 
THIS AREA, WHO LIVE AROUND THIS 
AREA, WHO ARE OBVIOUSLY 
TERRIFIED RIGHT NOW. 
WHAT THEY HAVE WITNESSED IS 
THIS LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE 
WHICH HAD SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES 
SCREAMING INTO THIS LOCATION. 
YOU HAVE LOCAL POLICE AS WELL 
AS THE ATF AND THE FBI. 
SO YOU HAVE THIS HUGE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE. 
AND SO YOU HAVE CITY OFFICIALS 
THERE IN ANNAPOLIS TRYING TO 
COORDINATE THEIR RESPONSE TO 
THE COMMUNITY AND THE KEY THAT 
WE HAVE SEEN THROUGHOUT SIMILAR 
INCIDENTS LIKE THIS ONE IS THAT 
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR LOCAL 
OFFICIALS TO GET THE WORD OUT 
TO THE COMMUNITY AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE. 
WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY PRESS 
CONFERENCES YET. 
BUT WE SUSPECT THAT WILL HAPPEN 
MOMENTARILY. 
>> THEY ARE SETTING UP A MEDIA 
STAGING AREA. 
FAMILIES ARE BEING TOLD TO 
REUNITE WITH THEIR LOVED ONES 
AT A LOCAL LORD & TAYLOR. 
IT SEEMS THAT THESE ACTIVE 
SHOOTER SWAYINGS ARE BECOMING 
MORE -- SITUATIONS ARE BECOMING 
MORE AND MORE. 
>> THEY HAVE HAD TO UPDATE THE 
STRATEGIES. 
EVERY SHOOTING PRESENTS A NEW 
DILEMMA FOR RESPONDING TO THESE 
INCIDENTS. 
SO THEY HAVE HAD TO OVER THE 
YEARS UPDATE THEIR RESPONSE 
PROCEDURES. 
DURING THE COLUMBINE INCIDENT 
IT WAS DETERMINED THAT, YOU 
KNOW, POLICE TOOK TOO LONG TO 
MOVE IN. 
AND THEN SINCE THEN, OVER THE 
COUPLE OF DECADES ALMOST SINCE 
THEN, THERE HAS BEEN THIS 
CHANGE IN APPROACH IN THAT LAW 
ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT WAIT TO GO 
INTO SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. 
WHAT THEY TRY TO DO IS GET IN 
THE FIRST OFFICERS ON THE SCENE 
ARE SUPPOSED TO GET INTO THE 
BUILDING AND RESPOND AND 
NEUTRALIZE THE TARGET AS FASTED 
AS THEY CAN. 
WHETHER THAT HAPPENED IN THIS 
CASE, IT SOUNDS LIKE IT. 
GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE 
REPORTING THAT THERE HAS BEEN 
AN ARREST, SOMEBODY IS IN 
CUSTODY. 
BUT THAT IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING 
THAT INVESTIGATORS POST 
OPERATION WILL LOOK INTO AS 
WELL. 
OVER THE YEARS, THE RESPONSE 
TACTICS HAVE HAD TO EVOLVE. 
THESE ARE TEAMS OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT THAT TRAIN 
REPEATEDLY IN THESE ACTIVE 
SHOOTER SWAYINGS BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE BEEN HAPPENING SO 
FREQUENTLY. 
>> JEFF, HOW MUCH OF A CONCERN 
IS THE COPY CAT EFFECT? 
THESE SHOOTINGS HAPPEN. 
THEY'RE BROADCAST WIDELY. 
HOW MUCH OF A CONCERN IS THERE 
AND HOW MUCH ARE YOU HEARING 
YOUR SOURCES TALK ABOUT THE 
CONCERN OF WHETHER OR NOT 
PEOPLE ARE SEEING THIS ON 
TELEVISION AND WANTING TO DO 
SOMETHING SIMILAR TO GET THAT 
NOTORIETY? 
>> FOR SOME REASON, IT 
MOTIVATES THE PEOPLE TO ACT OR 
PERHAPS TO DELIVER SOME SORT OF 
THREAT. 
SOMETIMES OVER THE PHONE. 
AND SO WHAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS 
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THESE IS 
THAT YOU HAVE THIS UPTICK IN 
COPY CAT THREATS. 
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT 
REALLY TIES UP LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T JUST LET 
THESE THINGS GO. 
THEY HAVE TO INVESTIGATE. 
WITH ALL OF THESE INCIDENTS 
UNFOLDING ACROSS THE COUNTRY, 
THERE ARE INVESTIGATORS WHO 
FEAR THAT UNFORTUNATELY WHEN 
PEOPLE SEE THESE IMAGES, IT 
GETS IN THEIR HEADS AND IT CAN 
LEAD TO COPY CAT INCIDENTS. 
OBVIOUSLY WE HOPE THAT DOESN'T 
HAPPEN IN THIS CASE. 
AND OUR JOB OBVIOUSLY IS TO 
REPORT THE NEWS AS IT IS 
HAPPENING. 
AND THIS IS A PUBLIC SERVICE 
OBVIOUSLY. 
ESPECIALLY AS THIS SITUATION IS 
STILL UNFOLDING, THERE ARE 
PEOPLE WATCHING THIS PROGRAM 
RIGHT NOW TRYING TO GET 
INFORMATION BECAUSE THEY DON'T 
HAVE ANY INFORMATION FROM 
OFFICIAL SOURCES JUST YET. 
>> PERHAPS THERE ARE LOVED ONES 
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN ESCORTED OUT 
OF THE BUILDING. 
THANK YOU, JEFF. 
WHAT WE KNOW NOW IS THERE AN 
ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION IN 
ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND AT THE 
CAPITAL GAZETTE NEWSPAPER. 
IT IS OWNED BY THE BALTIMORE 
SUN. 
WE HAVE BEEN GETTING 
INFORMATION FROM INSIDE THAT 
BUILDING. 
THERE ARE TWEET THAT'S HAVE 
COME OUT FROM ONE OF THE 
REPORTERS AT THE CAPITAL 
GAZETTE. 
THIS REPORTER SAYS THAT A 
SINGLE SHOOTER SHOT MULTIPLE 
PEOPLE AT MY OFFICE. 
SOME OF WHOM ARE DEAD. 
CBS NEWS HAS CONFIRMED THAT 
FOUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN 
THIS INCIDENT. 
WE DO NOT KNOW IF THE INCIDENT 
IS CONCLUDED. 
WE DON'T KNOW IF THE THREAT IS 
NEUTRALIZED BUT WHAT WE CAN 
CONFIRM IS ONE PERSON IS IN 
CUSTODY. 
WE SAW THE PICTURES THAT WE 
HAVE SEEN TOO MANY TIMES OF 
PEOPLE BEING LET OUT OF THAT 
BUILDING WITH THEIR HANDS UP. 
I'M SURE FILLED WITH FEAR. 
MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE MAY BE HAD 
WITNESSED WHAT HAPPENED. 
WE LEARNED ABOUT THIS AS WELL 
FROM SOMEONE WHO WAS THERE. 
SOMEONE WHO SAYS HE IS AN 
INTERN AT THE CAPITAL GAZETTE 
WHO TWEETED ACTIVE SHOOTER AT 
888 BESTGATE. 
THAT IS THE LOCATION. 
AND HE WROTE PLEASE HELP US. 
LET'S BRING IN PAUL, A CBS NEWS 
SECURITY ANALYST. 
WHAT IS THE LATEST THAT YOU 
HAVE LEARNED, PAUL. 
>> THE LAST THING THAT I HEARD 
IS THAT THEY ARE STILL TRYING 
TO ASCERTAIN AND CONFIRM THERE 
WAS ONLY ONE SHOOTER. 
AND THEY HAVE NOT -- THEY HAVE 
NOT MOVED PAST THAT AT THIS 
POINT. 
THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY ONLY 
HAVE ONE. 
THEY BELIEVE THAT HE IS 
CONTAINED. 
BUT THEY HAVEN'T GONE FORWARD 
AND SAID THEY HAVE CONFIRMED 
THERE WAS ONLY JUST ONE. 
>> WHAT WILL IT TAKE FOR LAW 
ENFORCEMENT TO KNOW THAT THE 
SITUATION HAS BEEN NEUTRALIZED, 
THIS THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE 
SHOOTER AND THERE ISN'T SOMEONE 
ELSE HIDING OUT TRYING TO WAIT 
THEM OUT? 
>> SEVERAL THINGS. 
ONE, THEY'RE CREATING TWO 
PERIMETERS. 
ONE IS THE OUTSIDE THAT POLICE 
HAVE DONE. 
MEANING NO ONE IS GOING TO GET 
ON THE CAMPUS. 
THE INSIDE PERIMETER IS WHERE 
THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE. 
THEY'RE GOING TO LOCK THAT 
DOWN. 
AT THE SAME TIME WE ALSO KNOW 
THAT THERE IS A DEVICE THAT THE 
BOMB SQUAD IS GOING TO HAVE TO 
VERIFY WHETHER OR NOT IT IS AN 
EXPLOSIVE DEVICE OR NOT. 
SO THEY'RE EVACUATING THE 
BUILDING AT THE SAME TIME 
THEY'RE SETTING UP THE 
PERIMETERS. 
WHILE ALL OF THAT IS STILL 
GOING ON, THEY NEED TO 
ASCERTAIN THAT THROUGH -- 
THROUGH CAMERAS THE GENESIS OF 
WHEN THIS PERSON CAME ON THE 
CAMPUS, WAS THIS PERSON WITH 
SOMEBODY ELSE. 
THEY CAN -- IF THEY CAN VERIFY, 
WHICH IS WHAT THEY'RE CLOSE TO 
RIGHT NOW, IF THEY CAN VERIFY 
HE WAS ALONE, THEN THEY KNOW 
THEY ONLY HAVE ONE PERSON AND 
THE SITUATION IS CONTAINED AND 
THE SCENE IS CONTAINED, ABSENT 
THE DEVICE THAT THEY STILL HAVE 
TO CHECK. 
>> ONE OF THE LAST THINGS THAT 
WE HEARD FROM POLICE IS THEY 
ARE SEARCHING THE BUILDING. 
WHAT IS THE SYSTEMATIC WAY THAT 
THEY TRY TO CLEAR THE BUILDING. 
IS THAT GOING FROM OUTSIDE IN 
OR FLOOR TO FLORIDA. 
HOW DO THEY MAKE SURE THAT 
SOMEONE IS NOT ON THE LOOSE 
EVADING THEM. 
>> THAT IS A PAIN STAKING LONG 
PROCESS. 
I CAN TELL YOU WITHOUT ANY 
HESITATION, THEY WILL START AT 
THE BOTTOM FLOOR OF THIS 
BUILDING. 
EVERY SQUARE INCH WILL HAVE TO 
BE CLEARED. 
AND OFFICERS, TACTICAL OFFICERS 
WILL COME IN FROM THE BOTTOM 
AND WORK THEIR WAY UP. 
FROM FLOOR TO FLOOR. 
THEY WILL HAVE TO CLEAR ROOM BY 
ROOM. 
CLOSET BY CLOSET. 
UNTIL THEY CAN ACTUALLY VERIFY 
THAT THAT BUILDING IS CLEARED. 
>>> IT TAKES A LONG TO TO DO. 
>> ACCORDING TO EYE REPORTER IN 
THE ROOM. 
HE SAYS THE SHOOTER SHOT 
THROUGH A GLASS DOOR. 
WHAT DOES IT TELL YOU ABOUT THE 
NATURE OF THE SHOOTING OR THE 
WEAPON. 
>> INTENT. 
INTENT. 
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT -- 
THINK ABOUT THIS. 
IF THIS WAS AN EMPLOYEE THAT 
GOT DISCIPLINED TWO HOURS AGO, 
FOUND THEY WEREN'T GETTING 
PROMOTED OR FIRED, HIGHLY 
NLIKELY THEY WILL HAVE  
FIRE POWER ON THEM TO 
PERPETRATE THIS TYPE OF EVENT. 
THEY HAD PLANNED THIS TYPE OF 
EVENT OUT. 
THEY HAD THE FIRE POWER IN 
ORDER TO DO THAT. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF 
GLASS THEY HAD. 
SUFFICE IT TO SAY SOMEONE 
PLANNED THIS THING OUT. 
THAT MEANS IN ALL PROBLEM IT 
WAS AN EX-EMPLOYEE OR SOMEBODY 
THAT HAD THOUGHT THIS THING OUT 
AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER, 
POSSIBLY A FORMER SPOUSE THAT 
CAME BACK ANGRY AT SOMEBODY IN 
A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION. 
OR IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMEBODY 
THAT TRULY HAS DISDAIN TOWARDS 
THE NEWSPAPER. 
CLEARLY THAT TELLS ME THIS WAS 
PLANNED OUT. 
. 
>>> I'M SURE THERE ARE PLENTY 
OF BAGS IN THE ROOM WHERE 
PEOPLE HAD TO LEAVE QUICKLY. 
HOW DOES THE ATF DISCERN WHAT 
IS A THREAT AND WHAT IS NOT? 
>> JEWEL I KNOW AT THIS POINT 
IS IT IS DESCRIBED AS A 
PACKAGE. 
IT HAS NOT BEEN DESCRIBED AS A 
BACKPACK. 
OR AS A BOX. 
JUST A PACKAGE IT SELF. 
BUT THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE 
CLEARED BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE 
HAPPENS, AT THIS POINT. 
>> Reporter: TO I WANT TO SHARE 
WITH YOU WE HAVE GOTTEN WORD 
THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND 
MEDICAL CENTER HAS CONFIRMED 
THEY HAVE ONE PATIENT INVOLVED 
IN THIS SHOOTING. 
THAT MIGHT BE THE PATIENT THAT 
WE SAW LOADED ON TO A 
HELICOPTER EARLIER TODAY THAT 
WAS OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING ON 
A GURNEY. 
LOADED ON TO A HELICOPTER, 
WHICH LEFT THAT AREA, 
PRESUMABLY SOMEBODY WHO WAS 
INJURED IN THIS SHOOTING. 
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE 
WERE INJURED IN THE SHOOTING. 
BUT THE FACT THAT FOUR PEOPLE, 
FOUR WERE KILLED, WHAT DOES 
THAT SAY TO YOU ABOUT THE 
PROBABILITY THAT THERE ARE 
MANY, MANY MORE INJURED, IF 
FOUR WERE SHOT DEAD? 
>> THERE IS ALMOST A CERTAINTY. 
THE OTHER PART WE HAVE TO 
REMEMBER IS THE PEDIGREE OF THE 
SHOOTER IS GOING TO TELL US A 
LOT AND WE DON'T KNOW THE 
WEAPON USED AND THE ROUNDS 
USED. 
AND THAT WILL TELL US A LOT AS 
WELL, AS FAR AS THE PLANNING 
AND THE MENS REA WITH REGARD TO 
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT. 
IN ALL PROBABILITY, TIMES THAT 
BY TWO IF NOT THREE, WITH 
RESPECT TO THE AMOUNT OF 
INJURED, AND AS WELL AS THE 
FACT THAT STILL, EVEN THOUGH WE 
INITIALLY HAD AIR SUPPORT, AIR 
MEDEVAC COMING IN, THEY ARE 
STILL COMING IN. 
THAT MEANS THERE ARE MORE 
PEOPLE THAT ARE INJURED THAT WE 
KNOW ABOUT, AT THIS POINT. 
>> WE HAVE TALKED A LOT ABOUT 
HOW SCHOOLS ARE PREPARED FOR 
THIS KIND OF EVENT, SCHOOLS 
HAVE REGULAR LOCKDOWNS. 
DO YOU THINK WORK PLACES ARE 
SUFFICIENTLY PREPARED? 
>> I DO NOT. 
WORK PLACES HAVE NOT DONE AS 
MUCH DUE DILIGENCE AS THEY NEED 
TO DO. 
ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK AT 
PROVIDING A SAFE WORK 
ENVIRONMENT. 
HOW MANY PLACES OF BUSINESS PUT 
THE TIME IN, TO MAKE SURE THEY 
HAVE NOT JUST PROPER ACCESS 
CONTROL, BUT EVACUATION 
PROCEDURES. 
HOW MANY WORKPLACES ARE 
PREPARED TO EVACUATE FOR A 
FIRE? 
OKAY. 
BUT HOW MANY ARE PREPARED TO 
EVACUATE FROM AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER? 
NOT VERY MANY. 
HOW MANY HAVE SPENT THE TIME TO 
TRAIN AND EDUCATE THEIR STAFF 
ON THE VARIOUS NUANCES THAT 
AFFECT THE WORKPLACE TODAY? 
I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT WE 
ARE AS PREPARED AS WE SHOULD BE 
AT THE WORKPLACE. 
>>> IT HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT 
MORE THAN AN HOUR SINCE THIS 
HAPPENED, ROUGHLY. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK POLICE ARE 
DOING NOW? 
DO YOU THINK THEY ARE STILL 
GRASPING AT STRAWS FOR 
INFORMATION? 
THEY HAVE ONE PERSON IN 
CUSTODY. 
WHERE DO YOU THINK THEY'LL TAKE 
THAT PERSON? 
>> LET'S START WITH THE FIRST 
PART OF THAT QUESTION. 
UNEQUIVOCABLY, THEY'LL ISOLATE, 
DECIDE WHO HAS JURISDICTION AND 
START QUESTIONING. 
>> JURISDICTION MEANING COUNTY 
POLICE, ANNAPOLIS POLICE, FBI? 
>> YES. 
JURISDICTION WILL BE DECIDED. 
THAT IS WHO WILL START TALKING 
TO HIM. 
GRANTED, THERE MAY BE MORE THAN 
ONE AGENCY INVOLVED IN THAT 
INTERVIEW. 
THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT 
THAT. 
BUT REMEMBER THIS, AND THIS IS 
THE IMPORTANT THING FOR OUR 
VIEWERS TO UNDERSTAND. 
THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT 
ASPECTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION 
THAT ARE GOING TO GO ON 
SIMULTANEOUSLY. 
SO, AS THEY ARE DOING THAT, YOU 
HAVE THE LEGAL SIDE OF THIS 
TEAM, THAT IS GOING TO BE 
LOOKING FOR SEARCH WARRANTS ON 
THE INDIVIDUAL'S HOME. 
ON THE INDIVIDUAL'S COMPUTER, 
PHONE, CAR, ET CETERA. 
BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THAT 
PRIMARY INFORMATION IS GOING TO 
COME, AS WE START TO ASCERTAIN 
THE PLANNING ASPECT OF THIS. 
WHO DID THEY COMMUNICATE? 
HOW DID THEY PLAN IT? 
WHERE DID THEY GET THE WEAPON 
FROM? 
WEBSITES THAT THEY VISITED. 
YOU MENTIONED TERRORISM BEFORE. 
THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY 
WE CAN'T SAY ANYTHING IN 
SITUATIONS LIKE THIS UNTIL WE 
KNOW, WHO DID THEY SPEAK TO? 
WHAT WERE THEY LOOKING AT? 
WHO WERE THEY INVOLVED WITH? 
SO THE LEGAL SIDE OF THIS IS 
MOVING TOWARD SEARCH WARRANT. 
ONCE THAT IS OBTAINED, THEN OF 
COURSE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE 
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT TEAMS 
EXECUTE THAT GO SEARCH WARRANT. 
THAT INFORMATION WILL BE 
OBTAINED. 
ONCE OBTAINED, IT WILL BE 
ANALYZED AND THEN THERE IS 
GOING TO BE A WHOLE NEW WITNESS 
LIST AS TO WHO WE NEED TO SPEAK 
TO. 
WHO WAS HE E-MAILING? 
WHO WAS HE TEXTING? 
WHO DID HE SPEAK TO RIGHT 
BEFORE HE WALKED IN THE 
BUILDING? 
ALL THESE THINGS WILL COME AS 
PART OF THE INVESTIGATION. 
>> PROBABLY GET THE SUSPECT'S 
CELL PHONE AND GO THROUGH THAT 
AS WELL. 
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. 
TEXT MESSAGES, E-MAILS, CELL 
PHONE, ALL THAT WILL COME AS 
PART OF THE SEARCH WARRANT. 
INVESTIGATORS WILL THEN START 
STAGE II OF THE INVESTIGATION 
TO SEE THE GENESIS OF THIS. 
WHERE DID THIS COME FROM? 
WHO ELSE MAY HAVE BEEN 
INVOLVED? 
>> PAUL, LET'S GO BACK TO CBS 
NEWS AND HOMELAND SECURITY 
CORRESPONDENT, JEFF WHAT IS THE 
LATE NEST. 
>> I WANTED TO BUILD ON A POINT 
THAT YOU WERE BOTH MAKING THERE 
AND THAT IS ABOUT THESE 
ELECTRONIC DEVICES. 
WHAT WE HAVE FOUND, AND 
INVESTIGATORS HAVE TOLD US IN 
INCIDENTS LIKE THIS, ONCE THEY 
GET THEIR HANDS ON ELECTRONIC 
DEVICES, A PHONE OR COMPUTER, 
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. 
IT GIVES SO MUCH INFORMATION 
ABOUT THE LAST FEW MINUTES AND 
LAST FEW WEEKS. 
THIS IS INFORMATION THEY WILL 
USE TO THEN PIECE TOGETHER A 
MOTIVE. 
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN? 
THAT IS THE QUESTION OF ALL OF 
THE ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATIONS. 
>> AT THIS POINT I CAN CONFIRM 
WE DO HAVE INJURIES. 
WE DID HAVE AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 
INSIDE THAT BUILD, 888 BEST 
GATE ROAD IN ANNAPOLIS. 
WE HAVE INJURIES. 
I CAN'T GIVE THE EXTENT OF 
THOSE INJURIES, AT THIS POINT. 
WE DO -- DON'T EXPECT THIS TO 
HAVE MAJOR CASUALTIES OR 
SEVERAL HUNDRED CASUALTIES. 
BUT WE DO HAVE INJURIES. 
I CAN CONFIRM THAT. 
AIL GET YOU AS MUCH INFORMATION 
AS POSSIBLE. 
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE INACCURATE 
INFORMATION AT THIS POINT. 
THAT IS THE ONLY REASON I CAN'T 
PROVIDE MORE. 
SO ONCE THE BUILDING IS SECURE, 
WE'LL GIVE MORE INFORMATION, 
WHETHER THE SUSPECT IS, IN 
FACT, IN CUSTODY, THAT BUILDING 
IS SECURE AND WE'LL MAKE SURE 
WE GIVE EVERYBODY A QUICK 
BRIEFING ON THE EXTENT OF THE 
INJURIES AND HOW MANY. 
AT THIS POINT ONE OF THE MAIN 
MESSAGES WE WANT TO GET OUT IS 
AVOID THE AREA. 
WE HAVE A LOT OF POLICE 
OFFICERS HERE, WE ARE THANKFUL 
FOR OTHER JURISDICTIONS, 
ANNAPOLIS CITY POLICE 
DEPARTMENT, MARYLAND STATE 
POLICE, HOWARD COUNTY, FEDERAL 
AGENCIES, EVERYONE HAS COME TO 
MAKE SURE WE GET AS MANY PEOPLE 
SAFE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. 
WE ARE ASKING FAMILY AND 
FRIENDS TO MEET AT THE 
ANNAPOLIS MALL IF YOU NEED TO 
MEET ONE A FRIEND OR LOVED ONE, 
OUR REUNIFICATION CENTER HAS 
BEEN SET UP INSIDE THE LORD & 
TAYLOR INSIDE ANNAPOLIS MALL. 
WE ARE ASKING EVERYONE TO 
RESPOND TO LORD & TAYLOR. 
WE HAVE OFFICERS THAT WILL 
ASSIST YOU MEETING UP WITH 
FRIENDS AND FAMILY THAT IS THE 
BIGGEST MESSAGE RIGHT NOW. 
WE ARE DOING OUR VERY BEST TO 
GET THE BUILDING SECURE, AND WE 
SHOULD HAVE INFORMATION FOR YOU 
VERY SHORTLY, AND AS SOON AS 
THAT BUILDING IS SECURE, WE'LL 
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE 
INFORMATION. 
WE APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S 
PATIENCE AND DOING EVERYTHING 
WE CAN TO GET EVERYBODY OUT 
SAFE. 
>>> 
>> Reporter: CAN YOU TELL US IF 
YOU UNDERSTAND THIS PERSON WAS 
ALONE? 
OR WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING 
ABOUT THIS? 
>> UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS POINT, 
I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON 
THE SUSPECT. 
AT THIS POINT, WE BELIEVE THAT 
IT IS ONE SUSPECT, BUT AGAIN, 
THAT IS ONE OF THE MANY THINGS 
THAT WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH IN 
OUR CHECKLIST TO MAKE THURSDAY 
THAT BUILDING IS SECURE. 
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE IS 
JUST ONE SUSPECT. 
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE IS 
NO OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE 
SUSPECTS OR THAT HELPED THIS 
INDIVIDUAL, AND MAKE SURE THERE 
IS NO TYPE OF BOMBS OR ANYTHING 
INSIDE THAT HAVE BUILDING. 
SO ALL THOSE THINGS WE HAVE TO 
THINK ABOUT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE 
ARE SAFE. 
OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS 
GETTING PEOPLE FROM THAT 
BUILDING OUTSIDE SAFELY, AND 
REUNITING THEM WITH THEIR 
FAMILIES. 
ONCE THAT BUILDING IS SECURE, 
WE CAN PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION 
AND THE INVESTIGATION WILL 
BEGIN AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET 
MORE DETAILS. 
>> Reporter: LIEUTENANT YOU 
HAVE INJURIES. 
HOW MANY? 
>> I CAN'T CONFIRM EXACTLY HOW 
MANY. 
I KNOW WE HAVE INJURIES. 
THAT WAS FIRST CALLED IN. 
SO AGAIN, WE DON'T ANTICIPATE 
THIS BEING SOME TYPE OF A MASS 
MAJOR CASUALTY WITH HUNDREDS OF 
INJURIES, BUT WE DO HAVE 
INJURIES. 
WE ARE DOING OUR VERY BEST TO 
MAKE SURE PEOPLE RECEIVE CARE 
THAT NEED CARE. 
WE ARE DOING OUR VERY BEST TO 
MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS EVACUATED 
OUT OF THERE. 
>> Reporter: THERE WERE 
OFFICERS IN THERE PLUS THE 
CAPITAL GAZETTE? 
>> I CAN'T CONFIRM AN EXACT 
LOCATION. 
IT WAS INSIDE 888 BEST GATE 
ROAD, WHICH DOES HOUSE SEVERAL 
BUSINESSES. 
I HOPE TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION 
ON THAT SOON ALL THE 
INFORMATION WE PASS ALONG I 
WANT TO MAKE SURE IS ACCURATE, 
SINCE IT INVOLVES SUCH A 
SERIOUS INCIDENT. 
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS 
ACCURATE. 
>> Reporter: LIEUTENANT FRASER 
RELEASED EVERYTHING HE CAN 
RIGHT NOW. 
>> THANK YOU, GUYS. 
>> Reporter: CAN YOU PELL YOUR 
NAME? 
>> FRA S HU R E. 
>>> THAT IS THE FIRST WE HAVE 
HEARD ABOUT THE ACTIVE SHOOTER 
SITUATION. 
HE SAID WE DID HAVE AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER SITUATION. 
HE SAID THEY ARE STILL SECURING 
THE BUILDING. 
HE CONFIRMED, AS WE ALREADY 
KNEW, THERE IS ONE SUSPECT IN 
CUSTODY. 
BUT HE SAID HE BELIEVES THERE 
IS ONLY ONE, BUT HE CANNOT SAY 
THAT YET WITH CERTAINTY. 
DID NOT GIVE MUCH INFORMATION 
ON PEOPLE INJURED. 
HE SAID THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE BEEN HURT, BUT HE 
WOULD NOT TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR 
NOT ANYONE HAS BEEN KILLED. 
CBS NEWS, OF COURSE, HAS 
CONFIRMED THAT FOUR PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN KILLED IN THIS HORRIFIC 
INCIDENT. 
THE FOCUS FROM THE LIEUTENANT 
WAS REALLY JUST FOR PUBLIC 
SAFETY. 
KEEPING PEOPLE AWAY FROM THAT 
AREA, TELLING THOSE WHO HAVE 
LOVED ONES, WHO WORK IN THAT 
BUILDING, WHERE THEY CAN 
REUNITE WITH THEM AT A LOCAL 
MALL. 
HE DID SPECIFY THAT THE CAPITAL 
GAZETTE IS NOT THE ONLY 
BUSINESS IN THIS BUILDING, BUT 
THAT THERE ARE OTHER BUSINESSES 
BASED THERE AS WELL. 
LET'S GO BACK TO CBS NEWS, 
JUSTICE AND HOMELAND SECURITY 
CORRESPONDENT. 
JEFF, WHAT IS YOUR TAKE? 
>> WELL THIS IS PRETTY 
TEXTBOOK, HOW THEY ARE 
RESPONDING TO THIS. 
AS WE TOLD OUR VIEWERS, THERE 
WOULD BE SOME SORT OF PRESS 
BRIEFING. 
THE PRESS BRIEFING THAT WE GOT, 
THERE WASN'T A LOT OF 
INFORMATION, AND THAT IS 
SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD EXPECT, 
AT THIS MOMENT. 
OBVIOUSLY IT IS STILL EARLY IN 
THIS INVESTIGATION. 
NOW THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 
INFORMATION ON THE SUSPECT. 
BUT THEY BELIEVE THAT IT IS 
JUST ONE SUSPECT. 
SO THAT IS IMPORTANT. 
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT 
THIS IS AN OPEN AND SHUT CASE, 
IN TERMS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING 
THERE ON THE SCENE. 
THEY STILL HAVE TO GO ROOM TO 
ROOM IN AND SEARCH FOR ANY SORT 
OF SECONDARY THREATS. 
WHAT IS ALSO TEXTBOOK HERE IS 
WHAT HE WAS SAYING ABOUT THE 
REUNIFICATION PROCESS. 
THE LAST THING THEY WANT ARE 
FAMILY MEMBERS RUSHING TO THE 
SCENE AND PERHAPS PUTTING 
THEMSELVES IN DANGER. 
SO WHAT THEY HAVE ADVISED IS 
THAT THESE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO 
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLE THEY 
KNOW, WHO MAY HAVE BEEN IN THE, 
INVOLVED IN THE ACTIVE SHOOTER 
SITUATION IN SOME WAY, THEY ARE 
ASKING THEM TO MEET AT A NEARBY 
MALL IN THE LORD & TAYLOR. 
AND SO THAT MAY HAVE BEEN ONE 
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS 
OF THE INFORMATION THAT HE WAS 
TRYING TO COMMUNICATE THERE 
THAT, THEY HAVE SET UP A REUNI 
CATION PROCESS AND THAT, AS I 
SAID, IS TEXTBOOK. 
THE FBI, BY THE WAY, SENDS OUT 
A VIDEO TO HELP INSTRUCT LOCAL 
POLICE DEPARTMENT ON HOW TO 
RESPOND IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS 
AND THAT IS THE KIND OF 
RESPONSE THAT THAT VIDEO 
OUTLINES. 
THAT SAID, THERE IS STILL A LOT 
OF UNCERTAINTY THERE. 
YOU COULD TELL THAT THE OFFICER 
WHO DELIVERED THAT INFORMATION 
MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT 
NERVOUS. 
HE TALKED ABOUT THIS NOT BEING 
A MASS CASUALTY EVENT WITH 
HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS. 
I'M SURE HE MIGHT LOOK BACK ON 
THAT AND REGRET PUTTING IT IN 
THOSE WORDS. 
BUT THEY ARE CONFIDENT, IT 
SEEMS, JUST BASED ON WHAT HE 
WAS TELLING US THERE, THAT THE 
SITUATION APPEARS TO BE UNDER 
CONTROL. 
AS WE HAVE REPORTED THERE ARE 
FOUR DEAD. 
THERE MAY BE MORE INJURED. 
WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET AND 
OFFICIALS HAVE NOT CON NAMED. 
BUT OBVIOUSLY, THEY ARE TRYING 
TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION OUT 
AS FAST AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN. 
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE AN AWFUL 
LOT TO GO ON. 
BUT THE FACT THEY HAVE SOMEONE 
IN CUSTODY, WELL THAT GIVES 
THEM SOMETHING IMPORTANT, 
OBVIOUSLY TO GO ON. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
IT, WHEN HE DID SAY IT WASN'T A 
MASS CASUALTY EVENT, OF COURSE 
YOU THINK ANY ONE DEATH IS ONE 
TOO MANY. 
THAT LIEUTENANT WAS GIVING THE 
INFORMATION. 
>> HE WAS ABLE TO GIVE, WHEN WE 
REPORT THESE STORIES, 
OFTENTIMES WHEN YOU SPEAK TO 
LAW ENFORCEMENT AT FIRST, THERE 
IS VERY LITTLE INFORMATION THEY 
ARE ABLE TO RELEASE. 
THEY HAVE THE SUSPECT IN 
CUSTODY. 
JEFF, WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE 
GOING TO BE THE KEY QUESTIONS 
THEY ARE ASKING THAT PERSON. 
>> THEY WANT TO KNOW WHY. 
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU 
KNOW, IF YOU ARE INVESTIGATING 
THIS, YOU WANT TO GET TO RIGHT 
AWAY. 
IF THIS IS SOMEONE WHO WAS 
COOPERATING WITH INVESTIGATORS, 
THAT IS THE QUESTION YOU WANT 
TO ASK IMMEDIATELY. 
WHY DID YOU DO THIS? 
HOW DID YOU DO THIS? 
BUT YOU DON'T JUST TRUST WHAT 
THIS PERSON IS SAYING. 
YOU ALSO HAVE TO SEARCH HOMES, 
SEARCH COMPUTERS, CELL PHONES. 
YOU GET WARRANTS TO SEARCH 
THOSE DEVICES AND SO THERE ARE 
DIFFERENT PIECES OF THIS 
INVESTIGATION ALREADY UNDERWAY. 
WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS WHAT IS 
HAPPENING AT THE SCENE. 
BUT BEHIND THE SCENES, THERE IS 
A LOT GOING ON AS WELL. 
THERE ARE TEAMS OF 
INVESTIGATORS NOW WORKING TO 
LOOK AT WHAT ELSE MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN HAPPENING AROUND THIS 
INCIDENT OR LEADING UP TO THIS 
INCIDENT. 
BUT WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT A 
QUICK RESOLUTION IN TERMS OF 
FINDING A MOTIVE FOR THIS, EVEN 
IF INVESTIGATORS HAVE A GOOD 
IDEA OF WHAT MAY HAVE MOTIVATED 
THIS INCIDENT, THEY MIGHT STILL 
HOLD BACK. 
THEY DON'T WANT TO PUT 
EVERYTHING OUT THERE IN THE 
FIRST FEW HOURS LIKE THIS. 
YOU REALLY HAVE TO GET YOUR 
DUCKS IN A ROW BEFORE YOU MAKE 
PUBLIC STATEMENTS. 
AGAIN, THAT IS PROBABLY WHY THE 
OFFICER WHO DELIVERED THAT 
BRIEFING DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF 
INFORMATION TO GO ON. 
THERE WAS PROBABLY INFORMATION 
THAT HE KNEW THAT HE DIDN'T 
CONVEY TO US, AND THAT THERE IS 
A REASON BEHIND THAT. 
THEY DON'T WANT TO PUT TOO MUCH 
OUT TOO SOON. 
>> IT WAS INTERESTING THE 
LIEUTENANT WAS ON THE PHONE AS 
HE WAS GIVING THAT BRIEFING. 
I WONDER WHO HE WAS SPEAKING 
TO. 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A REPORTER WHO 
CALLED HIM OR A SUPERIOR. 
JEFF WE ARE GETTING NEW 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE SUSPECT. 
ONE LAW ENFORCEMENT SOURCE 
TELLS CBS NEWS THE SUSPECT HAD 
NO ID WITH HIM. 
HE IS MALE, WHITE, AND IN HIS 
20s. 
JEFF AS HE IS BEING QUESTIONED, 
WHAT IF HE ASKS FOR A LAWYER? 
>> IF HE IS BEING QUESTIONED 
AND HE ASKS FOR A LAWYER, THEN 
AT THAT POINT YOU HAVE TO STOP 
QUESTIONING HIM. 
TYPICALLY THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS 
ACCORDING TO THE LAW. 
AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY 
ARE. 
OFTEN TIMES IN SITUATIONS LIKE 
THESE, THESE SHOOTERS, THEY 
WANT TO TALK. 
THEY WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT TYPE 
OF GRIEVANCE THEY HAVE HAD. 
WHEN WHEN THE SHOOTER SURVIVES, 
THAT IS WHAT YOU SEE, IS THAT 
THERE IS A FOOTPRINT, PERHAPS 
THEY PUT SOME SORT OF IMAGE 
ONLINE, OR PERHAPS THEY SAID 
SOMETHING ONLINE WHICH WOULD 
SUGGEST THAT THEY WERE IN A 
PLACE WHERE THEY COULD DO 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
>> IT MAKES ME THINK, OF COURSE 
OF THE 2015 SHOOTING THAT LED 
TO THE DEATH OF TWO TV STATION 
REPORTERS. 
THAT WAS STREAMED ONLINE. 
THAT WAS RECORDED ONLINE AS A 
WAY TO GET THAT NOTE RIGHT. 
JEFF I'M GOING TO TURN TO PAUL. 
PAUL AS JEFF WAS SPEAKING YOU 
WERE NODDING YOUR HEAD. 
>> JEFF IS ENTIRELY ON POINT. 
THE THING WE HAVE TO LOOK AT 
RIGHT NOW, REMEMBER, THEY ARE 
SEARCHING THE BUILDING, 
CLEARING THE BUILDING AND 
SEARCHING AT THE SAME TIME. 
IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO 
ASCERTAIN WHERE THIS SHOOTING 
TOOK PLACE. 
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS, AS WE 
LOOK, RETROACTIVELY BACK INTO 
SHOOTINGS, WE LOOK AT WHERE 
THIS TOOK PLACE. 
DID IT TAKE PLACE IN ONE 
OFFICE? 
OR DID THIS INDIVIDUAL GO FROM 
FLOOR TO FLOOR TO FLOOR? 
THAT IS GOING TELL US WHY HE 
CAME INTO THE BUILDING AND WHO 
HE WAS LOOKING FOR AND 
SPECIFICALLY, WHY HE WAS 
LOOKING FOR THOSE PEOPLE. 
IF IT OCCURRED THROUGHOUT THE 
BUILDING, IT IS A DIFFERENT 
STORY. 
WE SAW, IN THE LAST ONE THAT WE 
COVERED, WE SAW THIS INDIVIDUAL 
WENT FOR ONE CLASSROOM, ONE 
CLASSROOM ONLY. 
NOW WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT 
THIS BUILDING AND THEY ARE 
GOING TO SEE NOT JUST THE SHELL 
CASINGS AND THE WEAPON HE USED 
BUT WHERE HE WENT. 
IT TELLS US WHY DID HE GO TO 
THAT BUILDING TODAY? 
>> AND WHY, SPECIFICALLY, DID 
HE GO INSIDE THAT BUILDINGTO 
WHERE HE WENT? 
THAT IS GOING TO GIVE US THIS 
GREAT MOSAIC REGARDING THE MENS 
REA OR THE INTENT. 
>> WE DID HEAR FROM POLICE 
THERE ARE MULTIPLE BUSINESS IN 
HIS THAT BUILDING. 
SO IT IS POSSIBLE HE MAY HAVE 
BEEN TARGETING JUST THAT 
NEWSPAPER OR JUST THE BUILDING 
ITSELF, PERHAPS THIS SUSPECT 
FOUND A WAY TO GET INTO THE 
BUILDING, THEIR SECURITY WASN'T 
TIGHT ENOUGH. 
WE ARE LEARNING MORE FROM OUR 
CBS NEWS REPORTERS AND 
PRODUCERS THAT THE SUSPECT HAD 
A SHOTGUN. 
WHAT DOES THAT INDICATE TO YOU? 
>> VIOLENT DISDAIN. 
I KNOW WHEN WE SAY THAT, PEOPLE 
SAY PAUL, A SHOOTING IS 
VIOLENT. 
A SHOTGUN IS UP CLOSE. 
IT IS PERSONAL. 
THERE IS NO DISTANCE BEHIND 
THAT. 
AND YOU ARE INTENDING THIS TO 
BE VIOLENT AND MESSY. 
IT IS PERSONAL. 
WHAT THAT TELLS ME IS THAT IS 
GOING TO HAVE SOME SORT OF 
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP. 
WHETHER IT BE AN INDIVIDUAL 
THAT WAS FIRED THAT HOLDS 
SOMEBODY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR 
LOT IN LIFE OR AN INDIVIDUAL 
THAT FIELDS THIS PARTICULAR 
GIRL HE WAS DATING LEFT HIM FOR 
THIS PARTICULAR GUY AND THEY 
WERE IN THAT PARTICULAR OFFICE. 
IT IS PERSONAL. 
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY THAT 
PERSON USES THAT. 
BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF 
VIOLENCE, A LOT OF HATRED, AND 
DISDAIN BEHIND USING THAT 
SHOTGUN IN LIEU OF THAT 
HANDGUN. 
SO THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES 
REGARDING THE INTENT. 
>> BECAUSE OF THE SHEER POWER 
BEHIND A SHOTGUN? 
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT AND 
THE DAMAGE IT IS GOING TO DO 
AND HOW THAT IS GOING TO SPRAY. 
ONE SHELL, FOR YOUR VIEWERS TO 
UNDERSTAND, ONE SHELL FROM A 
SHOTGUN IS GOING TO SPRAY A 
VARIETY OF PELLETS OR SMALL 
BULLETS AROUND TO A SMALL AREA 
OF PEOPLE. 
IT IS NOT JUST IF YOU HAD A GUN 
AND YOU WERE TO SHOOT ME. 
IF IT IS A SHOTGUN, ANYBODY 
AROUND THIS PARTICULAR AREA IS 
ALL GETTING SHOT. 
THERE IS AN INTENT BEHIND THAT 
AND NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. 
>> IT IS JUST HORRIFIC. 
WE ARE ALSO HEARING MORE ABOUT 
THOSE INJURED. 
WE ARE LEARNING FROM SOURCES 
THAT THERE COULD BE FIVE PEOPLE 
INJURED IN THIS INCIDENT. 
WE KNOW THERE ARE FOUR PEOPLE 
WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED. 
WE ARE SEEING A HEAVY POLICE 
PRESENCE RIGHT NOW AT THIS 
BUILDING. 
THIS IS WHERE THE CAPITAL 
GAZETTE IS BASE IN ANNAPOLIS, 
MARYLAND. 
PEOPLE FROM THE BUILDING HAVE 
BEEN ESCORTED OUT WITH THEIR 
HANDS RAISED. 
POLICE ARE THERE. 
THEY HAVE BRIEFED THE MEDIA, 
BUT THE INFORMATION WAS VERY 
THIN. 
WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO TELL US 
IS THAT THEY ARE STILL CLEARING 
THE BUILDING. 
THEY WERE ABLE TO TELL US THEY 
HAVE ONE PERSON IN CUSTODY AND 
THEY BELIEVE THERE IS ONLY ONE 
PERSON INVOLVED. 
WHAT ABOUT THIS, PAUL, 
SURPRISES YOU? 
OR IS THIS SO FAR 
UNFORTUNATELY, TEXTBOOK? 
>> IT REALLY IS TEXTBOOK. 
I HATE TO SAY IT. 
I KNOW THAT IS NOT INFORMATION 
THAT WE WANT TO SHARE. 
BUT NO, IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME. 
DOESN'T SURPRISE ME AT ALL. 
THE FACT A FIRE IS USED, THE 
FACT A SHOTGUN IS USED, THE 
FACT IT IS OCCURRING IN A 
WORKPLACE, THE FACT IT IS 
OCCURRING DURING WORK HOURS, 
THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T 
DISCUSSED YET. 
THIS IS OCCURRING DURING THE 
MIDDLE OF THE DAY. 
THE INDIVIDUAL THAT MADE THIS 
DECISION MADE THIS DECISION TO 
DO THIS DURING THE MIDDLE OF 
THE DAY. 
IT IS PART OF THE IMPACT, PART 
OF THE RESPONSE. 
THEY DIDN'T DO THIS AT 
SOMEONE'S HOME. 
THIS GUY DID THIS FOR A REASON, 
AND HE DID IT AT THAT TIME OF 
DAY FOR A SPECIFIC REASON. 
THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT 
THAT. 
>> IN A VISIBLE PLACE WITH 
PEOPLE CLOSELY WORKING 
TOGETHER. 
>> AND MAXIMUM IMPACT. 
TO HAVE NETWORKS AS LARGE AS 
CBS THAT IS GOING COVER IT. 
YOU BROUGHT THIS UP BEFORE AND 
I MEANT TO SAY THIS BEFORE, 
VERY ASTUTELY YOU BROUGHT THIS 
UP, THE IDEA ABOUT COPYCATS. 
ATTENTION SEEKING. 
PEOPLE THAT ARE NORMAL 
SHOOTERS, FROM A BEHAVIORAL 
SIDE, THE PEDIGREE, THEY SEEK 
ATTENTION. 
THEY WANT TO BE HEARD. 
THIS GUY IS DOING THIS, AND WE 
DON'T KNOW THIS YET, I 
UNDERSTAND THIS. 
BUT I'M WILLING TO BET AS WE 
LOOK AT THIS TOMORROW MORNING 
OR TOMORROW EVENING, THIS 
INDIVIDUAL DID THIS, AND ONE OF 
THE REASONS WAS TO BE HEARD. 
TO GET A MESSAGE ACROSS. 
SO PEOPLE WOULD HEAR WHAT HE 
HAD TO SAY THAT DIDN'T HEAR 
WHAT HE HAD TO SAY BEFORE THAT 
 
OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN 
WORKPLACES, AND WE'VE SEEN IT 
IN SCHOOLS AND I THINK WE ARE 
GOING TO SEE IT HERE AGAIN 
TODAY. 
MID OF THE DAY. 
LIVE SHOOTING. 
SHOTGUN, FOUR DEAD. 
FOR THE RECORD, THAT IS A MASS 
SHOOTING. 
>> WHAT IS THE THRESHOLD, BASED 
ON YOUR EXPERTISE? 
>> WHENEVER YOU SEE MORE THAN 
THREE PEOPLE THAT ARE SHOT AND 
KILLED, THAT IS A MASS 
SHOOTING. 
AND AGAIN, WE GO BACK TO THE 
POINT YOU RAISED BEFORE THAT 
YOU SHARED THAT A SHOTGUN IS 
BEING USED. 
THAT IS INTENTIONAL. 
REMEMBER, NOT JUST ONE PERSON 
IS GETTING SHOT WITH THE 
PULLING OF THAT TRIGGER, 
SEVERAL PEOPLE ARE GETTING 
SHOT. 
WE WE HAVE FOUR PEOPLE DEAD, 
THAT IS A MASS SHOOTING. 
MORE INJURED, MORE PEOPLE BEING 
AIRLIFTED. 
WE STILL DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW 
MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HURT. 
BUT WE DO KNOW THIS WAS CLEARLY 
PLANNED OUT. 
>> AND THE FACT THAT THIS WAS A 
SHOTGUN, THAT RAISES QUESTIONS, 
NOW ABOUT THE SECURITY OF THE 
BUILDING. 
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T HIDE A 
SHOTGUN. 
YOU HAVE TO BRING IT IN, IN A 
LARGE BAG. 
>> LOOK, IT IS 90 DEGREES OUT. 
YOU CAN'T WEAR A COAT WALKING 
IN TODAY. 
HOW DID THIS PERSON COME UP TO 
THE CAMPUS. 
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE CAMPUS. 
WHEN WE LOOK AT A SUBURBAN 
CAMPUS LIKE THIS WE ARE NOT 
TALKING ABOUT MIDTOWN 
MANHATTAN. 
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE SOME 
DISTANCE BEFORE YOU WALK UP TO 
THAT BUILDING. 
HOW ARE YOU APPROACHING THAT 
BUILDING WHEN IT IS 90 DEGREES 
OUT AND WITH A SHOTGUN AND NO 
ONE SEES YOU? 
IS THERE ANY OUTER PERIMETER 
SECURITY? 
ARE THERE CAMERAS THAT INSIDE 
SECURITY SHOULD BE SAYING WAIT 
A SECOND, WE HAVE A GUY WALKING 
UP TO THE BUILDING WITH A 
SHOTGUN. 
I WANT TO KNOW HOW HE GOT IN 
THE BUILDING. 
FAIR ENOUGH I DON'T ALL 
QUESTIONS I'M SURE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT ARE EXPLORING RIGHT 
NOW. 
>> YOU CAN BET ON IT. 
>>> I WANT TO BRING BACK THE 
INFORMATION WE HAVE GOTTEN FROM 
TWITTER, FROM PEOPLE IN THE 
ROOM AS THIS WAS UNFOLDING. 
IT PAINTS A TERRIFYING SCENE. 
ONE REPORTER FROM THIS PAPER 
SAYS GUNMAN SHOT THROUGH THE 
GLASS DOOR TO THE OFFICE AND 
OPENED FIRE ON MULTIPLE 
EMPLOYEES. 
LATER HE TWEETED A SINGLE 
SHOOTER SHOT MULTIPLE PEOPLE AT 
MY OFFICE, SOME OF WHOM ARE 
DEAD. 
HE SAID I WILL TWEET WHAT I 
CAN, WHILE I WAIT TO BE 
INTERVIEWED BY POLICE. 
PLEASE WALK US THROUGH IF YOU 
CAN, PAUL, WHAT POLICE ARE 
DOING NOW IN TERMS OF GATHERING 
INFORMATION FROM THE WITNESSES 
WHAT KIND OF MANPOWER DOES THAT 
REQUIRE. 
>>> THERE ARE PROBABLY DOZENS 
OF PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE SEEN 
SOMETHING, AND THEY ALSO HAVE 
TO BE QUESTIONING THE SHOOTER 
OR THE SUSPECT SHOOTER HIMSELF. 
>> RIGHT. 
SO, LET'S START FROM THE 
GENESIS OF THAT. 
WHEN THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE 
BEING BROUGHT TO A SAFE AREA 
WHERE THEY CAN BE INTERVIEWED, 
THEY ARE GOING TO FIRST BE 
PLACED IN AN AREA AND GOING TO 
TRY TO MAKE SURE THEY REMAIN 
CALM AND SOME IN SOME TYPE OF 
ENVIRONMENT THAT IS CALMING, 
THAT IS NOT STRESSFUL. 
YOU STILL HAVE TO REMEMBER, 
THAT IS GOING TO BE A SECURED 
AREA. 
POLICE STILL HAVE TO LOOK AT 
THIS FROM THE SENSE THAT THEY 
CAN'T RULE OUT THE FACT THAT 
SOMEBODY INSIDE THAT BUILDING, 
RIGHT NOW, DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT 
THIS PREEMPTIVELY AND WASN'T 
INVOLVED. 
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO RULE THAT 
OUT, YET. 
THEN THEY'LL START INTERVIEWING 
PEOPLE ORDER OF DIRECTLY 
INVOLVED AS OPPOSED TO PEOPLE 
MAYBE OUTSIDE ON THE PERIMETER 
AND COLLATERAL PEOPLE AND THAT 
IS THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY 
WOULD INTERVIEW THEM. 
THEY'LL INTERVIEW THEM 
INDIVIDUALLY, AND THEN THEY MAY 
INTERVIEW THEM TOGETHER. 
BUT THAT IS THE PROCESS OF HOW 
THIS IS. 
AND I CAN TELL YOU, THIS IS 
GOING TO GO ON YOU KNOW, 
THROUGH THE NIGHT AND INTO 
TOMORROW AND OVER THE NEXT 
SEVERAL DAYS. 
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. 
>> AND A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE 
BEING INTERVIEWED ARE SHAKEN, 
TRAUMATIZE. 
>> OF COURSE. 
RIGHT. 
>> WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE? 
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE 
ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO REALLY 
RECALL WHAT HAPPENED AND TELL 
THEIR STORY IF MANY OF THEM ARE 
IN A STATE OF SHOCK. 
>> THAT IS SUCH A GOOD 
QUESTION. 
MY RESPONSE TO PEOPLE WHEN I'M 
INTERVIEWING PEOPLE IS TO CALM 
THEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. 
ASK THEM IF THEY ARE OKAY. 
DO THEY NEED ANYTHING. 
CONTRARY TO MOVIES, YOU DON'T 
GIVE THEM COFFEE. 
THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS TO 
BE MORE JACKED UP THAN THEY 
ALREADY ARE. 
YOU GET THEM A GLASS OF WATER 
AND ASK WHAT THEY NEED. 
ARE THEY PHONE CALLS THEY NEED 
TO MAKE. 
YOU TRY TO CALM THEM DOWN, 
BRING THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE DOWN 
A LITTLE BIT MORE. 
SO THAT THE TUNNEL VISION, 
REMEMBER THE TUNNEL VISION, WE 
NEED TO TAKE THEM OUT OF. 
THEIR HEART RATE SLOWS DOWN AND 
THEY CAN BE A BETTER PERSON TO 
INTERVIEW. 
ONCE YOU GET THEM TO THAT 
POINT, THAT IS WHEN YOU CAN 
ACTUALLY START THE INTERVIEW 
ONE-ON-ONE, BY ASKING THEM WHAT 
THEIR KNOWLEDGE WAS, WHAT THEY 
SAW, HEARD, SMELLED. 
RIGHT UP TO WHEN YOU CAME IN 
THIS MORNING UP TO THE POINT 
THAT HAPPENED. 
>> AND HOW DO POLICE ORGANIZE 
THEMSELVES? 
I MEAN, WE HAVE ANNAPOLIS 
POLICE, COUNTY POLICE, FEDERAL 
OFFICERS THERE. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> WHO TAKES THE LEAD? 
HOW IS THAT DETERMINED? 
>> IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION, 
THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT, 
BECAUSE THERE IS NO THERE IS 
NOTHING TO ASCERTAIN AT THIS 
POINT THAT THIS IS TERRORISM. 
SO IT IS GOING TO BE THE LOCAL 
AGENCY AND I DON'T KNOW WHO 
THAT IS. 
THE LOCAL AGENCY, IF THEY CAN 
HANDLE IT, WILL HANDLE IT, AT 
THIS POINT. 
IF THEY NEED ASSISTANCE, THEN 
THEY WOULD BRING IN MAYBE ATF, 
FBI, WHOEVER ELSE, WHATEVER 
OTHER AGENCIES FEDERAL AGENCIES 
THAT COULD ASSIST IN THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
BUT PRIMARILY THAT COMMAND 
CENTER IS GOING TO BE RUN BY 
THE LOCAL AGENCY. 
>>> WE HAVE JUST LEARNED FROM 
CBS NEWS LAW ENFORCEMENT 
SOURCES, THAT THE SUSPECT IS 
REFUSING TO IDENTIFY HIMSELF. 
WE KNOW HE IS WHITE, MALE, IN 
HIS 20s AND THAT HE HAS NO ID 
ON HIM. 
>>> WE WANT TO RECAP WHAT WE 
HAVE LEARNED. 
THERE IS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 
SITUATION. 
POLICE DO SAY THEY HAVE ONE 
PERSON IN CUSTODY. 
THIS IS A WHITE MALE IN HIS 
20s. 
WHO IS REFUSING TO IDENTIFY 
HIMSELF. 
THIS IS IN ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND 
AT THE CAPITOL GAZETTE 
NEWSPAPER BUILDING. 
THIS IS AT A NEWSPAPER 
ORGANIZATION. 
AND WE GOT REPORTS DIRECTLY 
FROM REPORTERS IN THAT NEWSROOM 
OR IN THAT ROOM WHERE THIS 
UNFOLDED, VIA TWITTER, WHO 
TALKED ABOUT WHAT WAS 
HAPPENING. 
WHAT THEY WERE SEEING. 
WE HAVE ONE REPORTER WHO SAID 
GUNMAN SHOT THROUGH THE GLASS 
DOOR TO THE OFFICE AND OPENED 
FIRE ON MULTIPLE EMPLOYEES. 
CBS NEWS HAS LEARNED FOUR 
PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THIS 
INCIDENT. 
LAW ENFORCEMENT SAYS THEY ARE 
STILL TRYING TO CLEAR THE 
BUILDING. 
THEY HAVE SECURED THE AREA, 
DESIGNATED A PLACE FOR ANYONE 
WHO HAS A LOVED ONE WHO WORKS 
IN THE BUILDING TO REUNITE WITH 
HIM. 
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE FEAR PEOPLE 
MAY HAVE WHO MAY KNOW SOMEONE 
WHO WORKS IN THAT BUILDING AND 
THAT HIS TO RUSH TO THAT 
LOCATION TO BE REUNITED WITH 
THEM. 
WE HAVE NO INFORMATION ON WHO 
THE DECEASED ARE. 
IT IS STILL VERY EARLY IN THE 
PROCESS. 
BUT WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM 
LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
THEY SAID THERE ARE INJURIES, 
BUT THEY WOULDN'T SPECIFY HOW 
MANY, THEY WOULDN'T SPEAK ABOUT 
ANYBODY WHO WAS POSSIBLY 
KILLED. 
THEY DID ACKNOWLEDGE THEY HAD 
THE SHOOTER IN CUSTODY AND THAT 
THEY BELIEVED THERE WAS ONLY 
ONE SUSPECT. 
I WANT TO BRING IN PAUL. 
>> IT SEEMS LIKE IN SO MANY OF 
THESE CASES IT IS A SINGLE 
SHOOTER, A YOUNG PERSON. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> WHAT DOES THAT TELL BUT 
RESOURCES. 
>>> WHAT MIGHT BE LEADING 
PEOPLE TO DO THIS AND ACT 
ALONE? 
>> WELL THE INTERESTING PART OF 
THIS IS, AGAIN, WE ARE SEEING 
SOMEBODY IN THEIR 20s. 
BUT IT IS A WORKPLACE.
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY ID AND HE 
WON'T IDENTIFY HIMSELF. 
WHAT DOES THAT TELL US? 
THEY HAVEN'T TOLD US ANYTHING 
ABOUT HIS PEDIGREE, OTHER THAN 
WHITE MALE IN HIS 20s. 
IT BEGS THE QUESTION, WHY IS AN 
INDIVIDUAL IN THEIR 20s COMING 
TO A WORKPLACE. 
LET'S SAY HE DIDN'T WORK AT. 
WHY IS HE COMING THERE WITH SO 
MUCH DISDAIN HE IS WALKING UP 
WITH A SHOTGUN. 
>>> THAT TELLS ME CLEARLY THERE 
IS SOME TYPE OF PERSONAL 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THAT 
INDIVIDUAL AND SOMEONE OR 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE IN THE 
BUILDING. 
IT COME DOWN WHAT IS THE LEVEL 
OF MOTIVATION AND CLEARLY THAT 
TELLS ME THIS IS SOMEBODY THAT 
MADE A DECISION WAY BEFORE 
TODAY THAT SELECTED THIS 
WEAPON, INTENTIONALLY TO COME 
THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. 
WHY? 
MAXIMUM IMPACT. 
THIS IS NOT SURPRISING ME ABOUT 
THE AGE. 
BECAUSE WE KNOW RIGHT NOW WELL 
OVER 60% OF SHOOTERS TODAY ARE 
BETWEEN 22 AND 31. 
THAT SKEW IS COMING OVER THE 
LAST FIVE YEARS WITH A LOT 
YOUNGER SHOOTERS. 
>> WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? 
>> WELL IT SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT 
WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH HERE 
IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH 
RESPECT TO THE USE OF FIREARMS 
AND THE MANNER IN WHICH 
CONFLICT IS BEING RESOLVED AND 
HOW BOTH OF THOSE ARE MARRYING 
TOGETHER INSIDE THE WORKPLACE 
AND INSIDE SCHOOLS, INSIDE 
CHURCHES. 
I MEAN, HOW MANY TIMES DO WE 
KEEP COVERING THIS? 
AND IT IS ALMOST EVERY THREE 
WEEKS, RIGHT? 
IT TELLS ME THAT WE HAVE A 
SIGNIFICANT EPIDEMIC, IN THIS 
COUNTRY, AS IT RELATES TO A 
LACK OF RESOLVING CONFLICT IN A 
PRODUCTIVE WAY AND WE ARE USING 
FIREARMS TO DO IT AND THE 
YOUNGER THEY ARE, THE MORE THEY 
ARE REVERTING TO THIS TYPE OF 
ACTION. 
>> IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE, I HAVE 
COVERED PROBABLY FIVE SCHOOL 
SHOOTINGS SINCE JANUARY. 
IT IS SHOCKING. 
HOW OFTEN THEY HAPPEN, HOW 
SIMILAR THEY ARE TO EACH OTHER. 
THIS IS IN A WORKPLACE. 
THE FACT THIS SUSPECT ISN'T 
IDENTIFYING HIMSELF, IS THAT 
WHAT POINTS YOU TO THE FACT 
THIS MIGHT BE DOMESTICALLY 
TIED? 
>> YES. 
>> AND NOT A WORK GRIEVANCE 
THAT SOMEBODY WANTS TO BRING 
NOTORIETY TO HIMSELF? 
>> THAT IS WHAT THAT'S TELLING 
ME. 
THE REASON WHY SOMEBODY 
WOULDN'T CARRY IDENTIFICATION 
AND DOESN'T WANT TO BE KNOWN, 
ALMOST MAKES ME FEEL THAT THAT 
PERSON DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE 
GOING TO LEAVE THE BUILDING. 
>> THAT THEY WOULD TAKE THEIR 
OWN LIFE? 
>> THAT IS EXACTLY CORRECT. 
A LOT HAS TO DO WITH HOW WAS 
THIS GUY CAPTURED? 
WE JUST KNOW THEY IDENTIFIED 
THE SHOOTER. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER HE 
SURRENDERED, AND WE NEED TO 
KNOW THAT. 
BECAUSE THAT IS GOING TO TELL 
US A WHOLE LOT MORE ABOUT WHY 
HE CAME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
DAY, AT THIS PARTICULAR 
LOCATION, WITHOUT 
IDENTIFICATION AND REFUSING TO 
IDENTIFY HIMSELF. 
>> WE DON'T KNOW IF EMPLOYEES 
IN THAT ROOM TACKLED HIM. 
WE HAVE SEEN THAT HAPPEN IN THE 
CASE. 
I BELIEVE A DENNY'S THERE WAS A 
SHOOTING. 
AND HE WAS TACKLED BY THOSE 
NEARBY. 
>>> YOU ARE ABLE TO CREATE THIS 
PATTERN TO LOOK FOR THINGS THAT 
WILL INDICATE WHETHER THIS 
MIGHT BE DOMESTICALLY TIED, BUT 
DOMESTIC SHOOTINGS HAPPEN MORE 
OFTEN THAN PEOPLE GUNGE THERE 
IS NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. 
WITH OVER 560 WORKPLACE 
VIOLENCE SHOOTINGS HAPPENING 
EVERY YEAR, THINK ABOUT THE 
FREQUENCY OF THAT WHEN WE TALK 
ABOUT THE IMPROBABILITY OF 
RISK. 
ARE I HAVE BEEN. 
SO YOU KNOW, IT IS NOT THAT WE 
DON'T HAVE EPIDEMIC PRO 
PORTIONS OF SHOOTINGS IN THIS 
COUNTRY. 
THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT 
THAT. 
BUT YOU DO RAISE A GREAT POINT 
WITH RESPECT TO THE AGE OF THE 
SHOOTER. 
THE AGES GOING DOWN. 
AND WE REALLY NEED TO START 
EXAMINING THAT. 
BUT I REALLY THINK, COMING BACK 
TO WHAT WE STARTED TALKING 
ABOUT BEFORE, WHEN WE ANALYZE, 
AND WE ARE NOT FAR FROM THIS. 
WE ARE GOING TO KNOW, PRETTY 
SOON, WHERE THIS SHOOTING 
OCCURRED IN THAT BUILDING. 
AS YOU POINTED OUT, THERE WERE 
MULTIPLE OFFICES AND COMPANIES 
IN THAT BUILDING. 
WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE IT 
OCCURRED, AND THAT IS GOING TO 
TELL US AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT WHY 
IT OCCURRED. 
>> THE WITNESSES THAT POLICE 
ARE INTERVIEWING, RIGHT NOW. 
ARE THEY GOING TO BE RELEASED 
OR HELD FOR FURTHER 
QUESTIONING? 
>> POSSIBLY, COULD BE BOTH. 
REALLY DON'T KNOW. 
I MEAN, POLICE WILL HOLD 
SOMEBODY IF THEY TRULY FEEL 
THAT PERSON IS NOT BEING 
FORTHRIGHT. 
IF THEY ARE LYING DURING THE 
COURSE OF THAT INTERVIEW. 
WHEN YOU ARE INTERVIEWING 
SOMEBODY, IF THEY ARE GIVING 
YOU MULTIPLE STORIES, ADAMANTLY 
PROCLAIMING ONE AND THE NEXT 
THING YOU KNOW, THEY ARE GIVING 
YOU A COMPLETE OPPOSITE STORY, 
YOU KNOW WHAT? 
I CAN TELL YOU, POLICE ARE 
GOING TO HOLD THAT PERSON FOR 
AWHILE. 
IT COULD BE EITHER. 
>>> LOOKING FOR CONSISTENCY? 
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. 
>>> PAUL, WE JUST GOT QUOTES 
FROM A REPORTER WHO WAS IN THE 
ROOM AS THIS HAPPENED. 
WE ARE ALSO SEEING PICTURES OF 
POLICE. 
THEY ARE GETTING READY TO 
ADDRESS REPORTERS. 
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN CUT TO THAT 
RIGHT NOW TO GET AN UPDATE. 
>> THIS IS A VERY ACTIVE AND 
ONGOING INVESTIGATION. 
WE ARE STILL TRYING TO MAKE 
SURE EVERYONE IS SAFE, REUNITE 
PEOPLE WITH THEIR FAMILIES. 
AND ONCE THE BUILDING IS SECURE 
WE HAVE A CRIME SCENE, 
OBVIOUSLY. 
SO WE ANTICIPATE THIS BEING A 
VERY LONG INVESTIGATION, VERY 
DETAILED INVESTIGATION BY 
DETECTIVES. 
I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE FIRST 
OUR COUNTY EXECUTIVE STEVEN 
SHUE. 
WE ARE GOING TO LIMIT QUESTIONS 
AT THIS TIME JUST FOR 
INVESTIGATIVE PURPOSES. 
WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO 
DO. 
THANK YOU. 
>>> THANK YOU, OFFICER. 
I'M COUNTY EXECUTIVE STEVE 
SHOE. 
WE HAVE HAD A TERRIBLE INCIDENT 
THIS AFTERNOON. 
THERE ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE DIED FROM THIS INCIDENT, 
AND SEVERAL OTHERS ARE INJURED. 
THOSE WHO ARE INJURED HAVE BEEN 
TRANSPORTED FOR MEDICAL CARE TO 
ANN ARUNEDDAL MEDICAL CENTER. 
THOSE FATALITIES ARE SO SAD. 
OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE 
WITH THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. 
WE TAKE COMFORT KNOWING THEY 
ARE IN GOD'S EMBRACE. 
THE SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY. 
I WANT TO COMMEND THE PUBLIC 
SAFETY PROFESSIONALS WHO WERE 
VERY QUICK TO THE SCENE HERE, 
WITHIN ABOUT 60 SECONDS. 
AND WE HAVE HAD A TREMENDOUS 
RESPONSE, NOT ONLY FROM THE 
COUNTY POLICE AND FIRE, 
ANNAPOLIS CITY POLICE AND FIRE, 
BUT ALSO STATE POLICE, HOWARD 
COUNTY, PRINCE GEORGE'S, 
SEVERAL FEDERAL AGENCIES, 
INCLUDING FBI AND ATF. 
I WANT TO THANK ALL THOSE 
AGENCIES FOR THEIR QUICK 
RESPONSE AND BEING OUR PARTNERS 
IN THIS VERY UNFORTUNATE 
INCIDENT. 
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK GOVERNOR 
HOGAN TO SAY A FEW WORDS. 
>>> I JUST WANT TO SAY FIRST OF 
ALL, OUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS 
ARE WITH THE VICTIMS AND THEIR 
FAMILIES. 
AND I WANT TO THANK THE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS WHO 
RESPONDED. 
OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM DID 
AN INCREDIBLE JOB. 
THEY ARE STILL DOING IT NOW. 
BUT THE FACT THEY RESPONDED 
WITHIN 60 SECONDS, I WANT TO 
GIVE SERIOUS PRAISE TO THE 
COUNTY AND THE CITY OF 
ANNAPOLIS FOR THEIR RESPONSE. 
WE WERE HERE WITH THE STATE 
AGENCIES TO BACK THEM UP. 
WE HAVE FEDERAL AGENCIES. 
IT IS A TRAGIC SITUATION. 
WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE 
INFORMATION YET, AND WE CAN'T 
GIVE ALL THE INFORMATION YET, 
BECAUSE IT IS AN ACTIVE CRIME 
SCENE AND AN INVESTIGATION. 
BUT WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL 
FATALITIES AND SEVERAL PEOPLE 
THAT ARE IN THE HOSPITAL. 
AND WE'LL JUST LEAVE IT TO THE 
PROFESSIONALS TO CONTINUE THEIR 
ONGOING INVESTIGATION. 
>> Reporter: CAN YOU TALK ABOUT 
THE NUMBER OF FATALITIES? 
MORE THAN TWO? 
CAN YOU TELL US AT LEAST ANY 
KIND OF NUMBERS NOW? 
>> I'M GOING TO TAKE THIS 
OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE OUR 
ACTING CHIEF. 
HE WILL ANSWER QUESTIONS. 
BUT AGAIN, PLEASE, IT WILL BE 
VERY BRIEF. 
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE 
INFORMATION PUT OUT IS 
ACCURATE. 
YOU KNOW, THERE IS A LOT OF 
PEOPLE INVOLVED HERE. 
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE 
INFORMATION IS ACCURATE AND WE 
DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING THAT 
WILL RUIN THE INVESTIGATION. 
THE SUSPECT IS STILL BEING 
INTERVIEWED BY DETECTIVES. 
ACTING CHIEF WILLIAM CRENSHAW. 
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, YOU CAN SEE 
WE HAVE OVER 10 PLUS AGENCIES 
ASSISTING. 
THE INVESTIGATION HAS JUST 
STARTED. 
SO AS BRIAN HAS SAID, WE ARE 
GOING TO BE QUITE AWHILE 
DETERMINING WHAT OCCURRED, WHY 
IT OCCURRED AND HOW IT 
OCCURRED. 
BUT AS THE GOVERNOR MENTIONED, 
WE WERE HERE QUICKLY, WE CAME 
INTO THE BUILDING VERY QUICKLY. 
WE RECEIVED A CALL AS AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER. 
WE DO HAVE FATALITIES AND WE DO 
HAVE SERIOUS INJURIES. 
WE ALSO HAVE MANY, MANY 
WITNESSES THAT ARE BEING 
INTERVIEWED, AND WE HAVE AN 
AREA, OVER BY LORD & TAYLOR 
THAT THE WITNESSES CAN REUNITE 
WITH THEIR FAMILIES. 
WE ARE ASKING THEM TO CONTACT 
THEIR FAMILIES, SO THAT THEY 
CAN COME AND ASSIST THEM WITH 
GETTING HOME SAFELY. 
AS RYAN MENTIONED BEFORE, OUR 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DIVISION 
HAS ONE PERSON IN CUSTODY. 
THAT PERSON IS AT OUR CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATION DIVISION DOWN IN 
CROWNSVILLE, AND WE WILL BE 
SPEAKING WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL 
QUITE FREAKILY, AND WELL 
SHORTLY, I SHOULD SAY, AND GET 
THE INFORMATION. 
THE BUILDING IS SECURE -F A 
TACTICAL STANDPOINT. 
THAT MEANS RIGHT NOW, WE 
BELIEVE, THERE ARE NO OTHER 
SHOOTERS IN THE BUILDING. 
BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN CLEARED 
FROM AN INVESTIGATIVE 
STANDPOINT. 
SO ONCE THE MEMBERS OF THE 
S.W.A.T. 
TEAM LEAVE THE BUILDING, THE 
INVESTIGATORS WILL GO IN, AND 
THEN WE WILL START TO PROCESS 
PUTTING THE INVESTIGATION 
TOGETHER. 
>> RIGHT NOW WE CAN'T CONFIRM 
EXACTLY WHERE THE SHOOTING 
OCCURRED. 
THE CAPITAL GAZETTE IS INSIDE 
THAT BUILDING. 
>> Reporter: DO YOU HAVE ANY 
NUMBERS ON CASUALTIES? 
>> NOT AT THIS POINT. 
>> Reporter: DID YOUR OFFICE 
INTERRUPT THE SHOOTING? 
>> OUR OFFICERS WERE ON THE 
SCENE VERY, VERY QUICKLY. 
I THINK IT WAS A MINUTE, MINUTE 
AND A HALF. 
AND THEY DID ENGAGE THE SUSPECT 
AND THAT IS WHEN HE WAS TAKEN 
INTO CUSTODY. 
IT OCCURRED VERY QUICKLY. 
FOR EVERYBODY, THAT IS OUR 
ACTING CHIEF AND I WOULD LIKE 
TO INTRODUCE THE MAYOR OF THE 
CITY OF ANNAPOLIS, KEVIN 
BUCKLEY. 
>>> THE CITY SENDS US LOVE AND 
THOUGHTS FOR ALL THE FAMILIES 
THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS 
HORRIBLE EVENT. 
I WANT TO COMMEND OUR FIRST 
RESPONDERS FORGETTING ONTO THE 
SCENE AS QUICKLY AS THEY DID. 
IF THEY WERE NOT THERE AS 
QUICKLY AS THEY WERE, IT COULD 
HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE. 
IT WAS A GREAT JOINT EFFORT BY 
EVERYBODY. 
THIS IS WHAT WE TRAINED FOR. 
A WEEK AGO WE PRACTICED AN 
ACTIVE SHOOTER TRAINING. 
WE DID NOT EXPECT SOMETHING 
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN IN OUR 
COMMUNITY, BUT WE WERE READY 
AND I DON'T THINK WE COULD HAVE 
PUT ANY MORE RESOURCES. 
IT IS A TREMENDOUS RESPONSE. 
>> Reporter: HOW MANY PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN KILLED? 
>> WE CAN'T CONFIRM THAT YET. 
I'LL LEAVE THAT ABOUT THE 
COUNTY. 
SO I'LL HAND IT BACK TO YOU. 
>> AT THIS POINT,BER STILL 
REUNITING PEOPLE WITH FAMILIES, 
AND WE ARE INTERVIEWING THIS 
SUSPECT, WE DON'T WANT TO PUT 
THAT INFORMATION OUT. 
>> Reporter: YOU ARE NOT 
LOOKING FOR ANYONE ELSE? 
>> AT THIS POINT HE IS THE ONLY 
ONE. 
I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE THE 
STATE'S ATTORNEY MR. WESLEY 
ABBOTT. 
>> THIS IS AN ACTIVE 
INVESTIGATION, WE'LL WORK IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH THE DETECTIVES 
AND THE POLICE OFFICERS 
HANDLING THE SCENE TO MAKE SURE 
WE HAVE EVERYTHING CORRECTLY. 
THAT IS THE ONLY COMMENT MY 
OFFICE CAN MAKE AT THIS TIME, 
BUT WE ARE ON SCENE ASSISTING 
WITH ALL THE OTHER LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. 
>> Reporter: YOU GUYS HAVE ANY 
TYPE OF MOTIVE RIGHT NOW? 
>> THE INVESTIGATION IS STILL 
ACTIVE AND ONGOING. 
MY OFFICE, IN PARTICULAR, 
CANNOT COMMENT IN ANY WAY ON 
EVIDENCE. 
>> Reporter: WHAT TYPE OF 
WEAPON WAS USED? 
>> TURN THAT BACK OVER TO 
LIEUTENANT FRAZIER SURE. 
>> WE ANTICIPATE HAVING ANOTHER 
BRIEFING VERY SHORTLY TO TRY TO 
GET THAT INFORMATION OUT. 
AT THIS POINT WITH IT BEING A 
VERY ACTIVE INVESTIGATION. 
WE IMMEDIATE TO MAKE SURE WE 
HAVE ACCURATE INFORMATION. 
WE ANTICIPATE ANOTHER UPDATE 
HERE VERY SHORTLY. 
. 
>> AT THIS POINT WE ARE STILL 
TALKING TO THE INDIVIDUAL, 
ENGAGING THE INDIVIDUAL AND 
TRYING TO FIND OUT ALL THE 
THINGS THAT COME ALONG WITH 
THESE INVESTIGATIONS. 
IT TAKES A LONG TIME. 
>> Reporter: GOVERNOR HOGAN, 
NOT SO LONG AGO WE GATHERED 
SIMILARLY IN SOUTHERN MARYLAND. 
A SHOOTING, LIKE THIS. 
WHAT ARE YOUR SHOTS? 
WHAT IS IN YOUR HEART THIS 
AFTERNOON AS THE LEADER OF OUR 
STATE? 
>> WELL THE FIRST THING YOUR 
HEART GOES OUT TO ALL THE 
PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES AND 
PEOPLE AFFECTED HERE. 
IT IS JUST A TRAGIC SITUATION. 
THEY ARE TWO ENTIRELY DIFFERENT 
SITUATIONS. 
BUT IN SOUTHERN MARYLAND WE HAD 
A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER THAT 
ACTED IMMEDIATELY AND SAVED 
LIVES AND NEAR HERE IN 60 
SECONDS WE HAD THE POLICE 
RESPONSE. 
WHILE BOTH ARE TRAGIC, OUR 
RESPONSE HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. 
I WANT TO PRAISE THE LOCAL 
OFFICIALS WHO PERHAPS SAVED 
LIVES BY GETTING THIS WHILE THE 
THING WAS TAKING PLACE AND 
APPREHENDING THE SUSPECT. 
AND HE IS IN CUSTODY. 
I KNOW IT IS FRUSTRATING. 
IT IS NOT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE 
INFORMATION, THEY JUST CAN'T 
SHARE THE INFORMATION. 
THEY KNOW THE NUMBER OF 
FATALITIES, THEY KNOW THE 
WEAPON. 
BUT THIS IS ACTIVELY GOING ON 
AND IT CAN HINDER THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
I BELIEVE WHEN THEY HAVE THE 
NEXT BRIEFING THEY WILL PROVIDE 
YOU WITH MORE. 
>> Reporter: DO YOU THINK IT IS 
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE RECENT 
ELECTS? 
>> NO. 
>> Reporter: WAS THE SHOOTER 
INJURED? 
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT 
INFORMATION AND THAT WILL BE 
TWO THINGS I'LL CHECK ON. 
WE ARE STILL TRYING TO 
DETERMINE THE SUSPECT. 
>> Reporter: DID THE SUSPECT 
EXCHANGE GUNFIRE WITH THE 
POLICE? 
>> THAT WILL BE MORE 
INFORMATION FOR THE NEXT 
BRIEFING. 
>> Reporter: CAN YOU CONFIRM HE 
USED A SHOTGUN? 
>> I CANNOT. 
AGAIN, WE HAVE SEVERAL 
QUESTIONS WE KNOW WE NEED 
ANSWERS FOR THE NEXT BRIEFING. 
WE ANTICIPATE HAVING TO BRIEF 
YOU WITHIN ANOTHER HOUR. 
AT THIS TIME THAT IS ALL THE 
INFORMATION WE HAVE. 
WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. 
>>> WE HAVE ONE MORE BIT OF 
INFORMATION. 
THAT IS THE LAST UNTIL THE NEXT 
BRIEFING. 
I ANTICIPATE ANOTHER BRIEFING 
VERY, VERY SHORTLY. 
THERE ARE FIVE FATALITIES WE 
KNOW OF. 
THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER PERSONS 
THAT ARE GRAVELY INJURED. 
WE WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION 
FOR YOU IN THE NEXT BRIEFING. 
THANK YOU. 
>> THAT WAS THE SECOND NEWS 
BRIEFING WE GOT FROM LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, IN ADDITION TO THE 
GOVERNOR, THE MAYOR, AS WELL AS 
OTHER MEMBERS OF LAW 
ENFORCEMENT RESPONDING TO THE 
SCENE. 
WE HAVE NOW LEARNED -F THAT 
NEWS BRIEFING THAT FIVE PEOPLE 
HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THIS 
INCIDENT. 
THAT IS UP FROM FOUR. 
FIVE PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR 
LIVES IN THIS SHOOTING. 
WE KNOW THAT CBS NEWS HAS 
LEARNED A SHOTGUN WAS USED IN 
THIS SHOOTING. 
POLICE WOULDN'T CONFIRM THAT. 
THEY DID TELL US IN THIS 
BRIEFING THAT OFFICERS ENGAGED 
THE SUSPECT. 
LET'S BRING IN HOMELAND 
SECURITY CORRESPONDENT, JEFF, 
YOU WERE LISTENING INTO THAT. 
WHAT STRUCK YOU FROM THAT 
CONFERENCE? 
>> WELL THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT 
OF INFORMATION THAT THEY WANT 
TO GIVE OUT. 
HE USED A SHOTGUN IN THIS 
SHOOTING. 
HE SURRENDERED WITHOUT 
INCIDENT. 
WHAT IS ALSO INTERESTING IS 
THAT WHILE THEY ARE TRYING TO 
ENGAGE HIM OUR CBS NEWS SOURCES 
ARE TELLING US HE IS NOT 
COOPERATING, IN THAT HE IS NOT 
REVEALING HIS IDENTITY. 
WHEN HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY, 
HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY FORM OF 
IDENTIFICATION ON HIM. 
I THINK THAT IS INTERESTING, 
TOO. 
I HAVE COVERED A LOT OF THESE 
TYPES OF INCIDENTS, AND THIS IS 
THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAVE 
HEARD OF A SUSPECT NOT 
IDENTIFYING HIMSELF. 
FRANKLY, IT IS NOT GOING TO 
TAKE LONG FOR INVESTIGATORS TO 
FIGURE OUT WHO THIS PERSON IS. 
SO I FOUND THAT INTERESTING AND 
PERHAPS SOMETHING THAT 
INVESTIGATORS WILL TALK ABOUT 
MORE WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR NEXT 
BRIEFING, WHICH, AS INDICATED, 
COULD COME WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR 
OR SO. 
BUT THIS IS STILL ONE OF THOSE 
SITUATIONS WHERE THEY ARE NOT 
REREELING THE MOTIVE JUST YET. 
IT IS TOO EARLY FOR THAT. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO 
HAVE THE QUESTION WHY DID THIS 
HAPPEN? 
WHY WAS THE CAPITAL GAZETTE 
TARGETED IN THIS WAY. 
THOSE ARE QUESTIONS 
INVESTIGATORS WILL OBVIOUSLY 
TRY TO ANSWER BY QUESTIONING 
AND ENGAGING THIS SUSPECT. 
BUT WHETHER HE COOPERATES WITH 
THEM FULLY BY REVEALING HIS 
MOTIVE, WE JUST DON'T KNOW YET. 
>>> YES, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
WE KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT MORE 
DIGGING TO DO ON THIS. 
WE ARE GOING TO LET YOU GO. 
JUST TO RECAP WHAT WE HAVE 
LEARNED FROM THIS NEWS 
CONFERENCE FROM POLICE AND FROM 
THE MAYOR AND THE GOVERNOR OF 
MARYLAND WAS THERE AS WELL, 
THEY HAVE CONFIRMED THERE ARE 
FIVE PEOPLE THAT ARE DEAD IN 
THIS SHOOTING. 
AT THE CAPITOL GAZETTE. 
THIS HAPPENED IN ANNAPOLIS, 
MARYLAND. 
WE ALSO LEARNED THAT POLICE 
WERE AT THE SCENE IN 60 SECONDS 
AND THAT THEY WERE THE ONES WHO 
ENGAGED IN SHOOTER AND -- THIS 
SHOOTER AND TOOK THIS SHOOTER 
INTO CUSTODY. 
PAUL, WHEN WE WERE WATCHING 
THIS, AND THEY SAID THAT IT WAS 
60 SECONDS BETWEEN THE TIME 
THAT THIS INCIDENT STARTED AND 
POLICE GOT THERE, WHAT DID THAT 
SAY TO YOU? 
>> THAT JUMPED OFF THE PAGE TO 
ME. 
THAT SAYS SO MUCH. 
BECAUSE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 
AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS NOT 
SURROUNDED BY POLICE. 
MINE, WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT, 
GOD FORBID, SOMETHING THAT 
WOULD HAPPEN HERE AND THERE IS 
A PATROL CAR DRIVING BY. 
THIS IS A SUBURBAN ENVIRONMENT, 
A CAMPUS THAT DOESN'T NORMALLY 
HAVE A POLICE PRESENCE. 
IT BEGS THE QUESTION WHY WERE 
POLICE SO CLOSELYBY? 
WHERE DID THIS WHAT HAPPENED? 
WHO NOTICED THIS? 
WAS THERE SECOND QUARTER ON THE 
CAMPUS? 
AND HOW WAS THE RESPONSE 60 
SECONDS? 
I'M GLAD IT WAS AND GRATEFUL IT 
WAS. 
BUT IT RAISES A HUGE QUESTION 
MARK IN MY MIND AS TO HOW THAT 
HAPPENED WITHIN 60 SECONDS. 
>> AND ALSO MIGHT POINT TO THE 
FACT THAT TRAINING HAS CHANGED. 
IT HAS SHORTENED THE RESPONSE 
TIME RIGHT NOW. 
BUT IT ALSO BEGS THE BE, FIVE 
PEOPLE WERE -- THE QUESTION, 
FIVE PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN THAT 
TIME PERIOD. 
>> EXACTLY. 
THINK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT. 
SOMEBODY IS WALKING UP TO A 
CAMPUS, WALKING UP WITH A 
SHOTGUN. 
IF YOU SEE THEM WALKING UP, AND 
THIS COULD BE WHY WE HAD 60 
SECONDS, MAYBE THEY HAVE AND 
THERE IS SO MANY MAYBES AT THIS 
POINT, MAYBE THEY HAVE SECURITY 
THAT ARE ON SITE, AND THEY SAW 
THIS INDIVIDUAL WALKING UP AND 
THEY CALLED 911, AND POLICE 
WERE CLOSE BY AND THEY 
RESPONDED. 
SO BY THE TIME THIS PERSON GOT 
THEIR WAY INTO THE CAMPUS AND 
STARTED SHOOTING, POLICE WERE 
THERE. 
GRANTED, THAT PROBABLY 
HAPPENED. 
BUT CLEARLY THERE WOULD NOT 
HAVE BEEN A RESPONSE TIME THIS 
EXPEDITIOUSLY IF THEY DIDN'T 
NOTICE THIS, UNLESS POLICE WERE 
SITTING IN THE PARKING LOT. 
>> 
>> AND AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED 
BEFORE TO THE FACT HE HAD A 
SHOTGUN AND NOT A PISTOL MAY 
HAVE TIPPED PEOPLE OFF, MAY 
HAVE TIPPED OFF SECURITY. 
I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT 
ABOUT WHAT WE LEARNED FROM 
ANEWS CONFERENCE. 
AS YOU AND I WERE ITSING HERE 
LISTENING, OUR EARS PERKED UP 
WHEN WE HEARD, THEY SAID THE 
BUILDING IS SECURED FROM A 
TACTICAL STANDPOINT, BUT NOT AN 
INVESTIGATION STANDPOINT. 
>> RIGHT. 
SO THEY CLEARED THE BUILDING 
BUT NOT THE Z SO CLEARED THE 
BUILDING MEANS THEY CLEARED THE 
BUILDING FROM PEOPLE. 
SO EVERYONE IS OUT OF THE 
BUILDING, THE BUILDING IS 
CLEAR. 
THERE COULDN'T BE ANOTHER 
SHOOTER, THERE ARE NO POTENTIAL 
VICTIMS, NO POTENTIAL 
WITNESSES. 
BUT THE SCENE HASN'T BEEN 
CLEARED. 
WHICH MEANS IN ALL PROBABILITY, 
THERE IS MORE THAN ONE CRIME 
SCENE. 
INVESTIGATORS WILL NOW COME IN 
AND START PLACING NUMBERS ON 
THE FLOORS AS TO WHERE THEY 
SEASHELL CASINGS, WHERE THEY 
SEE FOOTPRINTS, BLOOD SPATTERS 
AND CRIME SCENE TECHS WILL HAVE 
TO ANALYZE HOW MANY CRIME 
SCENES THEY HAVE. 
WHEN THEY HAVE SAID THEY HAVE 
CLEARED THE BUILDING BUT NOT 
THE CRIME SCENE, THAT IS WHAT 
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT. 
>> THOSE THAT EVIDENCE MARKERS? 
>> THAT IS EXACTLY CORRECT. 
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE 
GOING TO DO. 
START FROM THE GROUND AND GO 
UP. 
WHAT THAT TELLS US IS THERE IS 
PROBABLY MORE THAN ONE CRIME 
SCENE AND THAT IS HOW THEY ARE 
GOING TO PROCESS THAT. 
>> WHY DOES IT INDICATE IT IS 
MORE THAN ONE CRIME SCENE? 
>> WHEN THEY SAID THEY CLEARED 
THE BUILDING BUT NOT THE SCENE, 
THAT TELLS ME THERE WAS 
MULTIPLE SCENES. 
THE INDIVIDUAL PROBABLY FIRED 
HIS WAY IN, AND DISCHARGED 
OTHER ROUNDS IN DIFFERENT PARTS 
OF THE BILGED. 
WHEREVER THAT OCCURRED, THAT IS 
GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT CRIME 
SCENE, DIFFERENT BLOOD SPATTER, 
BROKEN GLASS AND A VARIETY OF 
TRACE EVIDENCE THAT WILL BE 
COLLECTED IN ALL THOSE 
DIFFERENT PLACES. 
THEY HAVE TO TREAT THEM AS 
DIFFERENT CRIME SCENES. 
REMEMBER ONCE THEY DEKYLE DYER 
IT IS CLEAR, THERE IS GOING TO 
BE A UNIFORM OFFICER PLACED ON 
THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING AND 
THEY WILL HAVE A LOG AND 
CONTROL ACCESS. 
SO UNLESS YOU HAVE A NEED TO BE 
IN THE BUILDING NO ONE IS GOING 
TO WALK IN THE BUILDING. 
BECAUSE WE SAW THE STATE 
ATTORNEY GOT INTRODUCED. 
THAT WAS NOT BY ACCIDENT. 
STATE ATTORNEY GOT INTRODUCED 
BECAUSE THEY ARE STARTING TO 
BUILD A CRIMINAL CASE RIGHT 
NOW. 
THEY BROUGHT THE STATE ATTORNEY 
IN, AT THAT TIME, LIKE WE WOULD 
HERE IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK 
WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S 
OFFICE TO MAKE SURE AS WE 
COLLECT EVIDENCE EVERYTHING IS 
DONE SYSTEMATICALLY SO NOTHING 
CAN FALL BETWEEN THE CRACKS. 
>> WHAT ROLE WILL THE FACT HE 
BROUGHT IN A SHOTGUN, NOT A 
PISTOL, WILL THAT PLAY IN THE 
CRIMINAL CASE BUILT AGAINST 
HIM? 
>> IT IS GOING TO COME DOWN TO 
INTENT. 
HE IS DOING BLOCKING, NOT SO 
MUCH TACKLING. 
HE IS NOT GOING TO IDENTIFY 
HIMSELF. 
THEY ARE GOING TO KNOW WHO HE 
IS. 
THE CHOICE OF WEAPON IS GOING 
TO CORRELATE TO THE INTENT 
BEHIND THE INCIDENT HIMSELF. 
HE IS PROBABLY GOING TO COUGH 
THAT UP LATER DURING THE COURSE 
OF AN INTERROGATION AND IF HE 
DOESN'T, IT IS GOING TO BECOME 
PAINFULLY CLEAR. 
REMEMBER WHAT WE ARE DOING 
RIGHT NOW IS WE ARE COLLECTING 
A PLETHORA OF EVIDENCE, 
FORENSICICALLY FROM SEARCH -- 
FORENSICALLY, WE ARE GOING TO 
KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW 
REGARDING THE INTENT OF THIS 
INCIDENT, JUST FROM THAT ALONE. 
>>> WE HAVE JUST HEARD FROM THE 
PRESIDENT ON TWITTER. 
HE TWEETED PRIOR TO DEPARTING 
WISCONSIN, I WAS BRIEFED ON THE 
SHOOTING AT CAPITAL GAZETTE IN 
ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND. 
MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE 
WITH THE VICTIMS AND THEIR 
FAMILIES. 
THANK YOU TO ALL THE FIRST 
RESPONDERS WHO ARE CURRENTLY AT 
THE SCENE. 
>> WE DID JUST LEARN THOSE 
FIRST RESPONDERS WERE THERE 
WITHIN 60 SECONDS. 
>> UNBELIEVABLE. 
INCREDIBLE RESPONSE TIME. 
>> WHICH HAS SAVED LIVES. 
WE WANT TO PAINT A PICTURE FOR 
OUR VIEWERS. 
THERE IS THE TWEET FROM THE 
PRESIDENT. 
WE WANT TO PAINT A PICTURE FOR 
OUR VIEWERS WHAT IT WAS LIKE 
INSIDE THAT ROOM. 
WE HAVE TWEETS, ALSO, FROM A 
REPORTER WHO WAS THERE. 
THIS REPORTER TALKED ABOUT 
WHATND, WHAT HE SAW. 
HE SAID A SINGLE SHOOTER SHOT 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE AT MY OFFICE 
AND WE HAVE ALSO HEARD MORE 
FROM THIS REPORTER FROM A 
BALTIMORE SUN ARTICLE, WHERE HE 
GAVE A QUOTE. 
SO THIS IS A REPORTER WHO WORKS 
FOR THE CAPITAL GAZETTE, WHICH 
IS OWNED BY THE BALTIMORE SUN. 
IN THIS ARTICLE, PUBLISHED BY 
THE BALTIMORE SUN, THIS 
REPORTER, WHOSE NAME IS PHIL 
DAVIS, A CAPITAL GAZETTE CRIME 
REPORTER, SAID THAT IT WAS LIKE 
QUOTE A WAR ZONE INSIDE THE 
OFFICES. 
HE SAID IT WAS A SITUATION THAT 
WOULD BE QUOTE HARD TO 
DESCRIBE, FOR AWHILE. 
HE CONTINUED AND SAID I'M A 
POLICE REPORTER. 
I WRITE ABOUT THIS STUFF. 
NO, SIR NECESSARILY TO THIS 
ACCIDENT, BUT SHOOTINGS AND 
DEATHS ALL THE TIME. 
HE SAID AS MUCH AS I'M GOING TO 
TRY TO ARTICULATE HOW 
TRAUMATIZING IT IS, TO BE 
HIDING UNDER YOUR DESK, YOU 
DON'T KNOW UNTIL YOU ARE THERE 
AND YOU FEEL HELPLESS. 
>> THOSE ARE WORDS FROM SOMEONE 
INSIDE THE WORD, FEARING FOR 
THEIR LIFE, WATCHING THEIR 
FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES BE 
GUNNED DOWN. 
ALL WE KNOW IS HE IS AIRMAIL 
MALE IN HIS 20s AND NOT 
COOPERATING WITH POLICE. 
DOES THAT INDICATE TO YOU, 
PUYALLUP, HE DID THAT TO -- 
PAUL, HE DID THAT PERHAPS TO 
GAIN ENTRY? 
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. 
THE THING WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE 
HERE IS THE INTENT BEHIND THIS 
PARTICULAR SHOOTING TODAY. 
THIS WAS PLANNED. 
YOU KNOW, HE KNEW WHAT HE 
WANTED TO DO AND HE KNEW WHEN 
HE WANTED TO DO IT AND WHERE HE 
WANTED TO DO IT AT. 
SO, BY HIM SHOOTING THROUGH A 
WINDOW, BASICALLY, IT MEANS 
THAT HE GOT TO A PARTICULAR 
POINT IN THAT BUILDING, HE 
COULDN'T GET ACCESS TO AND HE 
SHOT HIS WAY THROUGH IT. 
>> IT IS JUST HARD TO IMAGINE. 
>> AND NOTHING WAS GOING TO 
STOP HIM FROM GETTING WHERE HE 
NEEDS TO BE. 
WHICH SPEAKS TO THE CORE OF WHY 
HE DID WHAT HE DID. 
>> YOU TOLD US EARLIER THE FACT 
HE DOESN'T HAVE AN ID, MEANS HE 
MAY HAVE NOT PLANNED TO WALK 
OUT OF THAT BUILDING. 
>>> FOR THOSE OF YOU JUST 
JOINING US, WHAT WE KNOW SO 
FAR. 
AT LEAST 5 PEOPLE ARE DEAD 
AFTER A SHOOTING AT A NEWSPAPER 
IN ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND. 
THIS HAPPNED IN THE OFFICES OF 
THE CAPITAL AGAZETTE, A GAYLE 
-- GAZETTE, A DAILY PAPER. 
PHIL THOMAS FOUND HIMSELF 
REPORTING ON A CRIME AT HIS OWN 
WORKPLACE. 
HE TWEETED GUNMAN SHOT THROUGH 
THE GLASS DOOR TO THE OFFICE 
AND OPENED FIRE ON MULTIPLE 
EMPLOYEES. 
CAN'T SAY MUCH MORE, DON'T WANT 
TO DECLARE ANYONE DEAD, BUT 
I'S BAD. 
>>> AND THEN A SHORT TIME 
LATER, HE SAID THERE IS NOTHING 
MORE TERRIFYING THAN HEARING 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE GET SHOT WHILE 
UNDER YOUR DESK, AND THEN HEAR 
THE GUNMAN RELOAD. 
ANTHONY MESSENGER, WHO 
IDENTIFIES HIMSELF AS AN INTERN 
TWEETED THIS. 
ACTIVE SHOOTER 888 BEST GATE. 
PLEASE HELP US. 
>> IT IS JUST HORRIBLE TO 
EVERYONE TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT 
THIS PERSON, AN INTERN, A YOUNG 
PERSON, MUST HAVE BEEN FEELING, 
THINKING IN THIS MOMENT. 
AND HE HAD THE WHEREWITHAL TO 
TRY TO ASK 
POLICE DID RESPOND AND SAY A 
SUSPECT IS NOW IN CUSTODY. 
HAD HE NO ID ON HIM AND HE -- 
HE HAD NO ID ON HIM AND HE IS 
REFUSING TO IDENTIFY HIMSELF. 
HE IS WHITE, IN HIS 20s AND HE 
USED A SHOTGUN IN THE ATTACK. 
A COUNTY EXECUTIVE SAYS LAW 
ENFORCEMENT ARRIVED ALMOST 
IMMEDIATELY. 
>> THE SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY 
AND BEING INTERROGATED AT THIS 
TIME. 
I WANT TO COMMEND THE PUBLIC 
SAFETY PROFESSIONALS WHO WERE 
VERY QUICK TO THE SCENE HERE. 
>> MEANWHILE THERE ARE SOME 
VICTIMS OF THE SHOOTING AND WE 
DON'T KNOW HOW. 
SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE WERE 
INJURED IN THE ATTACK. 
WE DON'T YET KNOW THE SEVERITY 
OF THOSE INJURIES. 
WE WERE TOLD SOMEONE WAS TAKEN 
TO A TRAUMA CENTER.  
THE INJURIES WERE DESCRIBED AS 
SERIOUS. 
THE FACT THAT THESE ARE 
INJURIES THAT WERE CREATED BY A 
SHOTGUN ALSO INDICATES HOW 
SERIOUS THESE INJURIES COULD BE 
AND THAT'S WHAT WE WERE JUST 
DISCUSSING WITH PAUL VIOLAS, 
THE CBS NEWS SECURITY ANALYSTS. 
PAUL, AT THIS POINT WITH THE 
INFORMATION WE'VE GOTTEN FROM 
LAW ENFORCEMENT WHAT PICTURE 
DOES THAT PAINT FOR YOU? 
>> WELL, THE SAD PART ABOUT 
THIS IS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT 
WILL BE  AT A STANDSTILL UNTIL 
THEY CAN GET THE SEARCH 
WARRANTS APPROVED AND OBTAIN 
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS 
INDIVIDUAL. 
THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT WE JUST 
WON'T KNOW. 
SIMULTANEOUSLY AS WE MENTIONED 
BEFORE THE BREAK, THERE'S A LOT 
OF INFORMATION THAT WILL COME 
FROM THE CRIME SCENE 
PROCESSING. 
WE'LL KNOW THE SHELLS THAT HE 
USED. 
YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING VERY 
COMPELLING TO ME WHEN YOU WERE 
TALKING ABOUT AS THE REPORTER 
WAS RECANTING THIS PARTICULAR 
INCIDENT. 
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE 
GRAVITY OF THAT STATEMENT AND 
THE PASSION AND THE FEAR BEHIND 
THAT STATEMENT, THINK OF THE 
SOUND AND THAT'S OFTENTIMES 
WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T 
REALLY UNDERSTAND WHEN WE THINK 
OF THIS CRIME SCENE. 
WE SEE IT, BUT WE AREN'T 
HEARING IT. 
WE AREN'T SMELLING IT. 
THIS INDIVIDUAL IS UNDER A 
DESK. 
THE SOUND OF A SHOTGUN RACKING 
IS LOUD. 
IT'S INTIMIDATING AND YOU TAKE 
THESE SHELLS AND WHEN YOU ARE 
PLACING THEM IN THERE, THAT'S 
LOUD. 
IT REVERBERATES AND WHEN YOU'RE 
THINKING OF THIS PERSON UNDER 
THIS DESK THAT'S LISTENING TO 
THAT SOUND, IT'S TERRIFYING, 
NOT TO MENTION HE'S THERE 
SMELLING THE GUNFIRE AND 
LISTENING TO PEOPLE SCREAMING. 
SO AS POLICE PROCESS THIS, 
THEY'RE GOING TO EXAMINE NOT 
JUST THE MULTIPLE CRIME SCENES. 
THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK AT WHERE 
PEOPLE WERE INJURED, HOW CLOSE 
IN PROXIMITY WHICH THEY WILL BE 
ABLE TO ASCERTAIN THE PERSON 
WAS FROM THAT PARTICULAR 
SHOOTING BECAUSE REMEMBER, WHEN 
SOMEONE IS USING A SHOTGUN, 
THIS IS AT THIS DISTANCE, RIGHT 
ABOUT HERE. 
WHEN WE LOOK ABOUT 4, 5, 6 FEET 
AWAY, THAT'S THAT DISTANCE FROM 
A SHOTGUN AND THAT'S 
FRIGHTENING. 
SO WHEN THAT REPORTER WAS 
SAYING NOT ONLY DID THEY SEE IT 
AND HEAR IT, BUT THEY WERE 
LISTENING TO THE RELOAD, IT'S A 
HORRIFYING INCIDENT. 
RIGHT NOW POLICE ARE GATHERING 
THE INFORMATION THAT'S SITTING 
IN FRONT OF THEM IN THAT 
BUILDING, WHICH IS WHY THEY 
SAID WE CLEARED THE BUILDING 
BUT NOT THE SCENE AND AT THE 
SAME TIME THEY'RE GOING TO 
EXPEDITIOUSLY MOVE AND I MEAN 
EXPEDITIOUSLY TO SECURE THOSE 
SEARCH WARRANTS AND START 
PROCESSING AS MUCH AS THEY CAN 
ON THIS INDIVIDUAL. 
>> HOW CAN THEY SECURE THOSE 
SEARCH WARRANTS IF THEY DON'T 
KNOW WHO THIS GUY IS? 
>> THEY'RE GOING TO GET HIS 
PRINTS AND FIND OUT WHO HE IS. 
EVEN THOUGH HE'S TRYING TO 
OBSTRUCT JUSTICE AS MUCH AS HE 
CAN IN THE COURSE OF THIS 
INVESTIGATION BY PREVENTING 
THEM TO KNOW WHO HE IS, THEY 
WILL FIND OUT WHO HE IS. 
>> WHAT IF HE HAS NO RECORD AND 
HIS PRINTS AREN'T IN THE 
SYSTEM? 
>> WELL, THE INDIVIDUAL WILL 
HAVE PRINTS WHETHER OR NOT IT 
WAS FROM THE ACT THAT HE CAME 
THROUGH A SCHOOL SYSTEM OR WHEN 
YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS 
IN OUR SOCIETY TODAY WHERE 
WE'RE FINGERPRINTED FROM WORK 
AND SCHOOL AND PROFESSIONAL 
AFFILIATIONS AND SOCIAL 
AFFILIATIONS, CHANCES ARE THAT 
THOSE PRINTS WILL LEAD TO 
SOMETHING, BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU 
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT A 
PLACE LIKE THIS, THEY ARE GOING 
TO PULL OUT ALL THE STOPS. 
THEY WILL FIND OUT WHO HE IS. 
>> NOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE 
THIS HAPPENED, THIS WAS A 
WORKPLACE. 
THIS IS A NEWSPAPER. 
WHAT ARE THE CLUES THAT ARE 
INDICATING TO YOU WHAT KIND OF 
CRIME THIS IS? 
>> WELL, THE FACT THAT THE 
INDIVIDUAL USED A SHOTGUN TELLS 
ME THAT IT'S PERSONAL. 
THE FACT THAT HE'S COMING INTO 
THE BUILDING, BUT HE DOESN'T 
HAVE -- HE'S TRYING TO REALLY 
SHADE HIS IDENTITY AS MUCH AS 
POSSIBLE TELLS ME ONE OF TWO 
THINGS, ONE, THAT HE HAD 
DISDAIN TOWARDS THE NEWSPAPER, 
THAT HE HAD SOMETHING AGAINST 
SOMETHING IN THAT BUILDING THAT 
HE WAS JUST TAKING THAT 
PERSONAL VENDETTA OUT AGAINST 
OR THE LAST PART ABOUT THAT WAS 
THAT CLEARLY THAT THERE WAS 
SOME TYPE OF DOMESTIC ISSUE 
INVOLVED WITH THIS INDIVIDUAL. 
WHEN YOU THINK OF THAT, WE ALSO 
MARRY TOGETHER HIS AGE. 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT AGE, THE 
PROBABILITY OF A WHITE MALE AT 
THAT AGE HAVING SOME TYPE OF 
DOMESTIC SITUATION IS PRETTY 
HIGH WHEN YOU MARRY DOWN THE 
PROBABILITY OF RISK TO THAT 
DEMOGRAPHIC. 
SO THAT'S WHERE I WOULD LAY 
THAT OUT NOW. 
>> TYPICALLY SPEAKING IN VERY 
GENERAL TERMS WHEN YOU SEE A 
WHITE MALE IN HIS 20s INVOLVED 
IN A SHOOTING, THAT POINTS TO 
YOU, INDICATES TO YOU IF IT'S 
IN A WORKPLACE LIKE THAT IT 
MIGHT BE DOMESTIC. 
>> DOMESTIC RELATED. 
>> SO SOMEONE HE WAS IN A 
RELATIONSHIP WITH OR AN EX-GIRL 
FRIEND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT? 
>> RIGHT. 
OR IF THIS PERSON HAD SOME TYPE 
OF AFFILIATION WITH SOME TYPE 
OF RADICALLIST GROUP AND I'M 
NOT SAYING ISLAMIST AT ALL. 
I'M SAYING A RADICALLIST GROUP 
THAT FELT THERE WAS SOME TYPE 
OF ISSUE THAT WAS COVERED WITH 
THE NEWSPAPER. 
THIS IS WITH EVEN IF IT WAS THE 
NEWSPAPER BECAUSE THERE ARE 
OTHER EMPLOYERS THERE, BUT 
WE'RE KIND OF SPITBALLING AT 
THIS POINT LOOKING AT THIS. 
THAT COULD ALSO BE AN AGENDA 
BEHIND THAT PARTICULAR SHOOTER. 
>> YOU MENTIONED SO 
DEFINITIVELY THE FACT IT WAS A 
SHOTGUN MEANS IT'S PERSONAL. 
>> VERY MUCH SO. 
>> FOR PEOPLE NOT FAMILIAR WITH 
FIREARMS, WHY IS THAT? 
>> OKAY. 
SO A FIREARM, WHEN YOU THINK IF 
SOMEONE COMES IN WITH A 
HANDGUN, THEY HAVE CLEARLY AN 
INTENT BEHIND THAT, AS THEY 
WOULD A SHOTGUN. 
A SHOTGUN IS ALMOST LIKE 
SOMEONE USING A KNIFE IN THE 
COURSE OF A PERSONAL ATTACK, 
WHICH IS WHY WHEN YOU SEE A 
KNIFE USED IN AN ATTACK, IT'S 
CLOSE. 
IT'S IN CLOSE. 
IT'S THAT PERSONAL CONTACT. 
THERE'S DISDAIN. 
THERE'S ANGER AND IT'S REALLY, 
REALLY PERSONAL. 
THE SHOTGUN IS REALLY THE 
EQUIVALENT TO THAT IN A FIREARM 
WHERE THAT PERSON WANTS TO 
CAUSE AS MUCH DAMAGE AND AS 
MUCH PAIN AS POSSIBLE. 
THE LONG GUN WE'VE SEEN USED 
BEFORE IS MORE FOR MASS APPEAL, 
MASS EFFECT, MASS BODY COUNT OR 
FROM A LONGER DISTANCE. 
>> AUTOMATIC WEAPONS? 
>> CORRECT. 
>> AR15 STYLE WEAPONS? 
>> RIGHT. 
WHEN WE COVERED THE SHOOTING IN 
VEGAS AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
THE TYPE OF LONG GUN RIFLE THAT 
PERSON WAS USING FROM THAT 
DISTANCE, IT WAS BECAUSE OF 
MAXIMUM EFFECT, MAXIMUM BODY 
COUNT. 
THE SHOTGUN IS UP CLOSE. 
IT'S PERSONAL AND IT'S NOT JUST 
FOR ONE PERSON. 
IT'S FOR PEOPLE AROUND THAT 
PERSON. 
>> I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME 
INFORMATION WE'VE JUST LEARNED. 
WE HAVE A STATEMENT FROM THE 
NEW YORK POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT 
SAYS THEIR COUNTERTERRORISM 
TEAMS ARE BEING SENT TO MEDIA 
ORGANIZATIONS IN NEW YORK CITY. 
I'M GOING TO READ SOME OF THIS. 
IT SAYS, THE NYPD IS MONITORING 
REPORT OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER AT 
THE CAPITAL GAZETTE IN 
ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND. 
THESE DEPLOYMENTS ARE NOT BASED 
ON SPECIFIC THREAT INFORMATION 
BUT RATHER OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE 
OF CAUTION UNTIL WE LEARN MORE 
ABOUT THE SUSPECT AND MOTIVES 
BEHIND THE MARYLAND SHOOTING." 
IT SAYS HERE, " IT HAS BECOME A 
STANDARD PRACTICE TO SHIFT 
RESOURCES STRATEGICALLY DURING 
ACTIVE SHOOTER OR TERRORIST 
EVENTS." 
TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 
THAT, PAUL. 
WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS IN ONE 
PART OF THE COUNTRY, THE RIPPLE 
EFFECT THAT TAKES PLACE 
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE NATION. 
>> CERTAINLY. 
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING 
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT COULD BE 
CATEGORIZED IN TERMS OF AN 
ATTACK FOCUSED ON A PARTICULAR 
VERTICAL MARKET. 
IF WE'RE LOOKING AT AN ATTACK 
FOCUSED ON THE MEDIA, LET'S 
THINK ABOUT THAT. 
WE IN THE MEDIA, WE'RE SENDING 
MESSAGES OUT WITHOUT AN AGENDA. 
ESPECIALLY HERE AT CBS. 
IT'S PURE JOURNALISM. 
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT 
EVERYBODY IS GOING TO LIKE IT. 
THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GOING 
TO MAKE A LOT OF FANS JUST 
BECAUSE YOU'RE TELLING THE 
TRUTH AND YOU MAY, IN FACT, 
ATTRACT THAT RADICAL TYPE OF 
PERSON. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHO THIS PERSON 
WAS. 
WE JUST KNOW IT WAS IN THAT 
BUILDING, BUT POLICE WILL ERR 
ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION. 
KNOWING THE POLICE COMMISSIONER 
IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK I AM 
NOT SURPRISED THAT THEY'RE 
GOING TO TAKE EVERY PREEMPTIVE 
PRECAUTION THAT IF, IN FACT, 
THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS FOCUSED ON 
THE MEDIA AND IF, IN FACT, AS 
YOU POINTED OUT BEFORE WHICH 
WAS A VERY ASTUTE POINT, IF, IN 
FACT, THIS HAS A COPYCAT 
ATTACHMENT TO IT, THEN POLICE 
ARE GOING TO ACT PREEMPTIVELY 
TODAY AND LOOK AND SEE AND 
REALIZE WE WANT TO GET AHEAD OF 
THE CURVE AND IF THERE'S EVEN A 
SHADOW OF DOUBT THAT THIS MAY, 
IN FACT, CONTINUE TO OTHER 
CITIES, WE'RE GOING TO BE OKAY 
HERE. 
AND I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF 
IT'S NOT JUST HERE IN NEW YORK, 
BUT IF IT'S IN OTHER CITIES 
AROUND THE COUNTRY. 
>> PAUL, YOU JUST SAID THAT AND 
I JUST GOT THIS REPORT RIGHT 
HERE THE CHICAGO POLICE 
DEPARTMENT IS ALSO MAKING 
VISITS TO MEDIA OUTLETS. 
THAT INCLUDES, OF COURSE, OUR 
LOCAL STATION IN CHICAGO WBBM 
AND OTHER STATIONS AND 
NEWSPAPERS BASED IN CHICAGO. 
THIS, I'M SURE, AS YOU 
MENTIONED, IS PROBABLY 
HAPPENING IN OTHER CITIES 
ACROSS THE NATION BECAUSE AT 
THIS POINT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT 
HIS MOTIVE WAS. 
>> NO, WE DON'T KNOW. 
>> WAS IT AN ATTACK ON THE 
MEDIA, ON JOURNALISM? 
WAS IT A DOMESTIC ATTACK WITH 
SOMEONE HE KNEW INSIDE? 
IS THE SUSPECTED SHOOTER A 
FORMER EMPLOYEE? 
WE STILL DON'T HAVE THAT 
INFORMATION AND IT SOUND LIKE 
POLICE DON'T KNOW YET EITHER 
BECAUSE THIS PERSON ISN'T EVEN 
GIVING HIS NAME. 
>> THE INTERESTING PART HERE IS 
THEY STILL HAVEN'T TOLD US HOW 
THEY APPREHENDED HIM AND I 
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE 
NOT RELEASING THAT, BUT THAT'S 
GOING TO TELL US A LOT. 
DID HE SURRENDER? 
DID HE WALK OUT? 
DID HE SEE POLICE? 
DID HE SURRENDER OR DID THEY 
COME UP ON HIM? 
WE DON'T KNOW THAT. 
WE NEED TO KNOW THAT, BUT WE 
HAVE TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF 
CAUTION. 
IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
COMMUNITY AND YOU POINTED OUT 
BEFORE, WE ARE GOING TO ERR ON 
THE SIDE OF CAUTION AND WE'LL 
SEE THIS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 
I'M NOT SURPRISED ABOUT THAT. 
IF THIS WAS FOCUSED ON THE 
MEDIA AND WE DON'T KNOW THAT TO 
BE TRUE, BUT IF IT WAS FOCUSED 
ON THE MEDIA, WE NEED TO 
PREEMPTIVELY PROTECT OUR MEDIA 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW 
AND YEAR GOING TO SEE THAT 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- WE'RE 
GOING TO SEE THAT ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY. 
>> IN THE LATEST POLICE 
BRIEFING THEY SAY POLICE 
ENGAGED THE SUSPECT, BUT THEY 
DON'T KNOW HOW. 
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT WAYS 
THEY COULD HAVE ENGAGED THE 
SUSPECT? 
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY SAW 
HIM. 
FROM SOMEONE THAT'S DONE THIS, 
IT KEEPS COMING BACK TO ME 
ABOUT WHERE DID THEY SEE HIM? 
WHERE WAS HE CONFRONTED? 
WAS HE OUTSIDE OR INSIDE THE 
BUILDING? 
DID HE WALK OUT? 
DID HE DROP HIS GUN? 
DID THEY COME INSIDE THE 
BUILDING? 
IT JUST TELLS US SO MUCH. 
THERE ARE SO MANY UNANSWERED 
QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THAT, 
BUT WHEN THEY SAY WE CLEARED 
THE BUILDING, BUT WE HAVEN'T 
CLEARED THE SCENE, THAT MEANS 
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE SCENE. 
SO WHEN POLICE CAME INTO THE 
BUILDING, DID THEY ENTER THE 
BUILDING AND NOTICE THE 
INDIVIDUAL RIGHT AWAY? 
WERE THEY TOLD THAT HE'S 
UPSTAIRS? 
DID THEY HAVE TO CLEAR 
UPSTAIRS? 
HOW MANY POLICE RESPONDED? 
WAS IT JUST PATROL? 
DID THEY HAVE A TACTICAL UNIT 
AVAILABLE? 
THERE'S A LOT MORE WE DON'T 
KNOW THAN WHAT WE DO KNOW AT 
THIS POINT AND UNFORTUNATELY 
THAT'S JUST WHERE IT IS NOW. 
>> HOW ALL THIS HAPPENED IN 
JUST A MINUTE'S TIME THAT 
POLICE SAY IT TOOK THEM TO GET 
TO THIS SCENE. 
>> 60 SECONDS. 
>> AND WHAT THAT MUST HAVE 
LOOKED LIKE AS OFFICERS WERE 
ENTERING THIS BUILDING AND 
SEEING PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN SHOT 
DEAD, HAVING TO THEN SEE WHO 
COULD BE SAVED AND LOOK FOR THE 
SUSPECT. 
>> RIGHT. 
THINK ABOUT THIS. 
AS WE'RE TALKING THROUGH THIS 
RIGHT NOW, ANY ABOUT WHAT THIS 
LOOKS LIKE. 
AN -- THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS 
LOOKS LIKE. 
AN OFFICER COMES UP AND 
APPROACH THE BUILDING. 
IF, IN FACT, THEY CAUGHT THIS 
PERSON INSIDE THE BUILDING, 
THEY'RE GOING TO SEE BROKEN 
GLASS, TERRIFIED PEOPLE, MAYBE 
BLOOD SPATTERS. 
THEY HAVE TO BE VERY CONSCIOUS 
WHERE THEY STEP. 
THEY'RE LISTENING TO 
EVERYTHING. 
THEY'RE SMELLING FOR GUNPOWDER. 
THE CLOSER THEY GET -- 
>> THE STRONGER THE SMELL. 
>> EXACTLY. 
SO THEY'RE LISTENING, SMELLING, 
OBSERVING EVERYTHING. 
I'VE NOT BEEN IN THIS BUILDING, 
BUT LET'S LOOK AROUND US. 
HOW MANY POINTS OF ENTRY ARE 
THERE? 
IS THERE A STAIRWAY HERE? 
IS AN ELEVATOR THERE? 
ARE THERE TWO POINTS OF ENTRY 
HERE? 
I DON'T KNOW. 
WHERE DO THEY GO? 
SO THEY HAVE TO BE POINTED IN A 
CERTAIN DIRECTION. 
SO ALL OF THAT WHEN POLICE 
APPROACH HERE AND REMEMBER IF 
IT'S 60 SECONDS, IN ALL 
PROBABILITY THOSE ARE PATROL 
OFFICERS THAT ARE RESPONDING. 
SO WOMEN AND MEN IN UNIFORM 
PATROLLING AT THAT POINT PULL 
UP TO THERE. 
THERE'S NO BACKUP AT THIS POINT 
IF IT'S 60 SECONDS. 
THEY'RE LIVE. 
THIS THING IS FLUID. 
SO THEY'RE GOING TO RESPOND TO 
THAT BUILDING AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE. 
CREDIT TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT 
AND TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. 
THINK ABOUT IT. 
SHOTS FIRED, GLASS BROKEN AND 
THEY'RE RUNNING INTO IT. 
SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY 
WERE DOING AT THAT MOMENT. 
>> FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN 
THROUGH THESE TYPES OF 
SITUATIONS, HOW DO YOU MAKE 
THAT DECISION BETWEEN SEEING 
SOMEONE WHO IS HURT AND 
RESPONDING TO THEM VERSUS 
LOOKING FOR THE SHOOTER? 
>> IT'S INSTANTANEOUSLY. 
THE MOMENT THAT YOU CAN SEE 
WHERE SOMEBODY IS AT THAT 
POINT, IF THERE ARE STILL SHOTS 
BEING FIRED, YOU HEAR THAT THE 
SITUATION IS FLUID AND YOU SEE 
PEOPLE AT GROUND, YOU CAN'T 
STOP AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME AS 
MUCH AS YOU WISH YOU COULD TO 
ATTEND TO THAT PERSON. 
LET'S SAY YOU AND I ARE 
PARTNERS IN THAT BUILDING. 
WE CAN'T STOP AT THAT MOMENT 
BECAUSE SHOT ARE BEING FIRED 
AROUND THAT BUILDING. 
OUR JOB, AS MUCH AS WE WOULD 
LOVE TO HELP THAT PERSON AT 
THAT MOMENT, IS TO AS QUICKLY 
AS POSSIBLE GET TO THAT POINT 
WE CAN CONFRONT THIS PERSON AND 
ELIMINATE THE SITUATION. 
>> SO MANY DECISIONS THAT LAW 
ENFORCEMENT MAKES ARE SO 
DIFFICULT AND THEY HAVE TO BE 
MADE IN A SPLIT SECOND. 
>> NO QUESTION. 
>> KNOWING THAT AT ANY TIME A 
SHOOTER COULD BE HIDING AND 
COULD BE TARGETING THEM. 
TO RECAP FOR OUR VIEWERS WHEN 
WE KNOW, THESE ARE -- WHAT WE 
KNOW, THESE ARE PICTURES FROM 
ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND. 
THIS IS AT THE CAPITAL GAZETTE 
BUILDING IN ANNAPOLIS. 
THIS IS A LOCAL NEWSPAPER OWNED 
BY THE BALTIMORE SUN WHERE 
THERE WAS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 
SITUATION THIS AFTERNOON. 
POLICE NOW SAY THAT THE ACTIVE 
SHOOTER SITUATION IS OVER, THAT 
THE BUILDING HAS BEEN 
TACTICALLY CLEARED BUT IS NOT 
JET CLEARED FROM AN 
INVESTIGATORY STANDPOINT. 
SO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS, 
POLICE OFFICERS, DETECTIVES ARE 
GOING THROUGH THAT BUILDING 
RIGHT NOW LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE, 
PUTTING EVIDENCE MARKERS DOWN 
NEXT TO WHERE THEY SEE SHELL 
CASINGS, BLOOD, ANYTHING THAT 
CAN HELP THEM PAINT THE PICTURE 
OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT 
BUILDING. 
WE ALSO HAVE FORMER ASSISTANT 
FBI DIRECTOR RON HOSKO AND CBS 
NEWS SECURITY ANALYST ON THE 
PHONE WITH US. 
RON, WHAT'S YOUR ASSESSMENT AND 
GIVEN EVERYTHING YOU'VE HEARD 
SO FAR FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT, 
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE? 
>> WELL, THIS IS NOT UNLIKE 
OTHER ACTIVE SHOOTER INCIDENTS 
WHERE I JUST HEARD A BRIEF PART 
OF YOUR PRIOR GUEST, THE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT HAS AN OPPORTUNITY 
HERE TO MOVE VERY QUICKLY. 
WE KNOW IN THEIR RESPONSE, 
THEIR TRAINING TO ACTIVE 
SHOOTER INCIDENTS IN THE PAST, 
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS 
ARE VERY LIKELY PATROL 
OFFICERS. 
OFTENTIMES TODAY THOSE PATROL 
OFFICERS HAVE PATROL RIFLES 
THAT THEY ARE TAKING INTO A 
SCENE WITH THEM. 
NOT EVERYONE HAS THAT. 
THEY HAVE TO MOVE VERY QUICKLY 
TO THE THREAT. 
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO PAIR UP OR GET 
INTO A DIAMOND FORMATION WITH 
MULTIPLE OFFICERS THAT CAN 
REALLY SCAN FOR THE THREAT IN 
MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS AND MOVE 
VERY QUICKLY TO THAT THREAT. 
AS YOUR PRIOR GUEST MENTIONED, 
UNFORTUNATELY THAT DOESN'T GIVE 
THE FIRST RESPONDING OFFICERS 
MUCH OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO TEND 
TO THE WOUNDED PEOPLE WHO MAY 
BE CRYING OUT FOR HELP WHO MAY 
BE GRIEVOUSLY WOUNDED. 
THEY HAVE TO MOVE PAST THEM 
BECAUSE THERE IS THE THREAT 
THAT THERE WILL BE MORE 
INJURIES, CERTAINLY THE THREAT 
THAT THERE WILL BE INJURIES OR 
POTENTIALLY FATALITIES IN 
RETURN FIRE TOWARD THE POLICE, 
BUT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT 
THEY'RE GETTING INTO AND THEY 
MOVE VERY SYSTEMATICALLY TO THE 
SOUND OF THE GUNFIRE. 
úTHE GOAL 
THREAT AND THAT MEANS MOVING TO 
CONFRONT THE SHOOTER OR 
SHOOTERS AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE. 
REALLY THE ONLY THING THAT 
COULD POTENTIALLY SLOW THEM 
DOWN IS OBVIOUSLY A RETURN 
GUNFIRE AT THEM OR THE THREAT 
OF AN IED, AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE, 
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO 
PRESENT POTENTIALLY EVEN A 
BIGGER THREAT TO RESPONDING LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AND THAT MAY BE AN 
EXPLOSIVE DEVICE THAT THEY HAVE 
TO ASSESS, MARK OFF AND SOMEHOW 
WORK THEIR WAY AROUND AS 
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET TO THE 
SHOOTER. 
AS YOU KNOW, OFTENTIMES THESE 
SHOOTERS ARE THINKING ABOUT 
SUICIDE IN THEIR FIRST 
CONFRONTATION WITH LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AND IN SOME 
OCCASIONS MOST ASSUREDLY 
THEY'RE NOT PERFECTLY ADEPT IN 
THE USE IN THE FIREARMS THEY 
BRING INTO THE SCENES. 
SO THEY MAY HAVE A JAM OF A 
WEAPON OR DROP MAGAZINES AND 
ALL OF A SUDDEN LAW ENFORCEMENT 
IS THERE AND NOW THEY HAVE A 
HARD CHOICE TO MAKE. 
DO I ENGAGE IN A FURTIVE MOTION 
AND BRING LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE 
TOWARDS ME AND END THIS WITH MY 
OWN DEATH BY POLICE? 
MANY OF THEM CONTEMPLATE 
SUICIDE OR THEY GO SUICIDE WHEN 
THAT CONFRONTATION OCCURS. 
I THINK VERY OFTEN THESE FOLKS 
ARE THINKING OUT THEIR OPTIONS 
BEFOREHAND. 
THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT WHO 
THEIR TARGETS ARE, HOW THEY'RE 
GOING TO GET IN, HOW THEY 
PRESUMABLY MIGHT ESCAPE IF 
THAT'S THEIR INTENT AND I THINK 
SOME OF THEM REALIZE THAT MY 
END WILL COME WHEN LAW 
ENFORCEMENT ARRIVES. 
>> RON, SOMETHING THAT YOU 
MENTIONED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL 
OF AN IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE 
DEVICE, THERE WAS A BOMB THREAT 
AND PAUL VIOLAS WHO IS SITTING 
TO MY LEFT HAS JUST LEARNED 
FROM HIS SOURCES THAT THAT BOMB 
THREAT HAS BEEN CLEARED. 
RON, BACK TO YOU, WE'VE 
REPORTED THAT THE SUSPECT USED 
A SHOTGUN AND ONE WITNESS SAID 
THAT HE FIRED THROUGH A GLASS 
DOOR. 
WHAT DOES THAT TELL US? 
>> WELL, HE WAS DETERMINED TO 
GET INTO HIS TARGETS, WHOEVER 
HIS TARGETS WERE. 
HE HAD A DETERMINATION. 
LOOK. 
YOU DON'T GO INTO A BUSINESS IN 
A CITY IN AMERICA WITH A 
SHOTGUN FOR ANY REAL GOOD 
PURPOSE AT THIS POINT UNLESS 
YOU'RE LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
WE KNOW THAT OVER TIME KIND OF 
WHAT'S BEEN PERCEIVED AS THE 
ULTIMATE WEAPON HAS BEEN THE AR 
STYLE WEAPON, YOU KNOW, THAT 
CAN FIRE MANY ROUNDS, BUT A 
SHOTGUN IS IN MOST STATES, IF 
YOU DON'T HAVE A CRIMINAL 
RECORD OR SOME OTHER PROHIBITOR 
IN YOUR PAST, A SHOTGUN IS A 
COMMONLY USED HUNTING WEAPON 
ACROSS AMERICA, BUT A SHOTGUN 
CAN DO GREAT HARM. 
IN FACT, I'VE SEEN SOME WRITERS 
ARGUE THE CASE A SHOTGUN IS A 
WORSE, MORE DEADLY WEAPON THAN 
AN AR15 STYLE WEAPON BECAUSE IF 
YOU'RE USING 00 BUCK 12 GAUGE 
SLUGS, YOU KNOW, WE'RE TALKING 
ABOUT A SOLID LEAD PROJECTILE 
THAT IS, YOU KNOW, 1/2 INCH IN 
DIAMETER, THAT IS A DEADLY 
WEAPON AND A 00 BUCK ROUND IS 
GOING TO SHOOT MULTIPLE SLUGS 
THAT ARE AROUND .32 CALIBER IN 
SIZE. 
THAT NUMBER OF HIGH SPEED LEAD 
PROJECTILES COMING AT YOU IS 
INTENDED TO KILL. 
PEOPLE DEER HUNT WITH THESE 
WEAPONS. 
IT IS INTENDED TO BRING DOWN A 
BIG ANIMAL AND SO A SHOTGUN IN 
THE RIGHT HANDS UNFORTUNATELY 
HERE IN THE WRONG HANDS, MOST 
SHOTGUNS TYPICALLY CARRY FIVE 
ROUNDS LOADED. 
THEY ARE VERY QUICK TO RELOAD. 
SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOT 
OF PROJECTILES GOING DOWN RANGE 
AND DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF 
THE WEAPON, ANY LENGTH SHOTGUN, 
THE SHORTER IT IS, THE MORE 
QUICKLY THOSE -- LET'S SAY IT 
IS 12 GAUGE BUCKSHOT. 
THOSE PELLETS ARE GOING TO FAN 
OUT INTO A VERY WIDE PATTERN 
RELATIVELY QUICKLY. 
SO IF YOU'RE SHOOTING AT 
SOMEONE DOWN THE END OF A 
HALLWAY, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A 
SPREAD ON THOSE ROUNDS AND 
YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO 
POTENTIALLY TAKE DOWN MULTIPLE 
TARGETS AT THE SAME TIME. 
THESE ARE VERY DANGEROUS 
WEAPONS, BUT MOST COMMONLY ARE 
USED FOR SPORTING, FOR HUNTING, 
NOT USED IN THIS WAY. 
HERE SOMEONE WHO WAS A TWISTED 
SOUL HAD A DEADLIER PURPOSE IN 
MIND. 
>> RON, I'M GOING TO JUST KEEP 
YOU ON THE LINE THERE BECAUSE 
WE NOW HAVE A STATEMENT FROM 
THE METRO EDITOR AT THE CAPITAL 
GAZETTE. 
HIS NAME IS JIMMY DEBUTTS. 
THIS IS SO HARD TO READ. 
HE SAYS, "DEVASTATED AND 
HEARTBROKEN, NUMB. 
PLEASE STOP ASKING FOR 
INTERVIEWS AND INFORMATION. 
I'M IN NO POSITION TO SPEAK. 
JUST KNOW THAT OUR REPORTERS 
AND EDITORS GIVE ALL THAT THEY 
HAVE EVERY DAY. 
THERE ARE NO 40 HOUR WEEKS, NO 
BIG PAYDAYS, JUST A  PASSION 
FOR TELLING STORIES FROM OUR 
COMMUNITY. 
WE KEEP DOING MORE WITH LESS. 
WE FIND WAYS TO COVER HIGH 
SCHOOL SPORTS, BREAKING NEWS, 
TAX HIKES, SCHOOL BUDGETS, 
LOCAL ENTERTAINMENT. 
WE ARE THERE IN TIMES OF 
TRAGEDY. 
WE DO OUR BEST TO SHARE THE 
STORIES OF PEOPLE, THOSE WHO 
MAKE OUR COMMUNITY BETTER. 
PLEASE UNDERSTAND WE DO ALL 
THIS TO SERVE OUR COUNITY. 
WE TRY TO EXPOSE CORRUPTION. 
WE FIGHT TO GET ACCESS TO 
PUBLIC RECORDS AND BRING TO 
LIGHT THE INNER WORKINGS OF 
GOVERNMENT DESPITE MAJOR 
HURDLES PUT IN OUR WAY. 
THE REPORTERS AND EDITORS PUT 
THEIR ALL INTO FINDING THE 
TRUTH. 
THAT IS OUR MISSION, WILL 
ALWAYS BE." 
THOSE ARE POWERFUL WORDS FROM 
THE METRO EDITOR AT THE CAPITAL 
GAZETTE DEFENDING THE MISSION 
AND THEIR PASSION AT THIS 
NEWSPAPER TO BRING A COMMUNITY 
TOGETHER TO SHARE INFORMATION 
WITH THIS COMMUNITY, TO BRING 
TRUTH TO THE COMMUNITY, TO 
REPORT ON THE GOOD AND THE BAD. 
TODAY THE BAD, THE UNSPEAKABLE 
HAPPENED IN THEIR OWN OFFICE. 
THIS IS THE CAPITAL GAZETTE. 
THEY ARE PART OF THE BALTIMORE 
SUN. 
THE CAPITAL GAZETTE IS BASED IN 
ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND. 
ON THE LINE WE HAVE FORMER 
ASSISTANT FBI DIRECTOR RON 
HOSKO. 
RON, WHEN YOU HEAR THAT AND YOU 
KNOW THAT POLICE RESPONDED 
WITHIN 60 SECONDS TO ENGAGE THE 
SHOOTER, HOW UNUSUAL IS THAT TO 
YOU AND WHAT DOES THAT TELL 
YOU? 
>> WELL, LOOK, THIS IS IN A 
CITY LIKE THE SIZE OF ANNAPOLIS 
OR IN A MAJOR CITY AROUND THE 
COUNTRY, NOT THAT ANNAPOLIS IS 
THAT BIG, THIS IS THE 
EXPECTATION OF THE AMERICAN 
PATROL OFFICER, THAT YOU GET A 
CALL LIKE THIS. 
IT IS THE WORST CALL IMAGINABLE 
AND YOU'RE EXPECTED TO GET TO 
THAT SCENE AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE, MAKE SENSE OF IT AS 
BEST YOU CAN, IDENTIFY THE 
THREAT AND MOVE TOWARDS IT 
KNOWING THAT THIS COULD BE YOUR 
LAST DAY IN THAT POSITION 
YOURSELF. 
THIS IS THE UNFORTUNATE REALITY 
OF SICK PEOPLE, OF WEAPONS IN 
AMERICA, OF ANGER PERHAPS. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ULTIMATE 
MOTIVATION HERE WAS. 
WAS IT ANTI-MEDIA? 
WAS IT REALLY A WORKPLACE 
VIOLENCE SITUATION WHERE YOU 
HAD A DISAFFECTED EMPLOYE, 
SOMEBODY WHO WAS TERMINATED 
RECENTLY? 
TODAY PERHAPS WE'LL HAVE SOME 
SENSE OF MOTIVATION IN HOURS OR 
CERTAINLY BY TOMORROW WE'LL 
PROBABLY HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF 
WHO THIS PERSON WAS, WHAT THEIR 
HISTORY WAS, BUT THIS IS THE 
SAD REALITY IN AMERICA TODAY 
WHERE THESE INCIDENTS SEEM TO 
BE COMING AND ACCORDING TO FBI 
STUDIES THEY ARE COMING WITH 
INCREASING FREQUENCY AND 
UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE PROBABLY 
GOING TO HEAR MORE OF THESE. 
THOSE COMMENTS BY THAT 
NEWSPAPER MEDIA PERSON, AS YOU 
WERE READING THEM, IT STRUCK ME 
THE PARALLELS BETWEEN WHAT 
THESE REPORTERS ARE DOING AND 
WHAT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE 
THAT CAME TO STOP THIS TRAGEDY 
TODAY DO EVERY DAY AS WELL, 
LONG HOURS, LOW PAY, TRYING TO 
MAKE SENSE OF MADNESS IN THEIR 
COMMUNITIES, IN ONE CASE REPORT 
ON IT, IN THE OTHER CASE 
RESPOND TO IT. 
SO IT STRUCK ME HOW MANY 
úPARAL 
FOLKS WHO UNFORTUNATELY LOST 
THEIR LIVES TODAY AND THE 
RESCUERS THAT CAME TO THEIR AID 
TODAY. 
SO MANY PARALLELS THAT THEY 
HAVE. 
>> SO MANY COURAGEOUS FIRST 
RESPONDERS WHO RAN INTO HARM'S 
WAY AND GOT THERE IN ABOUT A 
MINUTE. 
THEY PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE 
LINE TO TRY TO SAVE LIVES. 
WE CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MANY LIVES 
WERE SAVED HERE. 
WE KNOW FIVE PEOPLE ARE KILLED, 
BUT IF LAW ENFORCEMENT HADN'T 
ARRIVED SO QUICKLY, IT COULD 
HAVE BEEN MORE. 
RON, STAY ON THE LINE WITH US. 
I WANT TO BRING IN JANE 
SCHLEGEL, THE NEWS DIRECTOR 
WITH WNAV RADIO IN ANNAPOLIS 
AND SHE IS AT THE SCENE. 
JANE, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING RIGHT 
NOW? 
>> Reporter:  I SEE MANY, MANY 
CAMERAS LINED UP WITH NEWS 
ORGANIZATIONS FROM ALL ACROSS 
EVERY LEVEL OF MEDIA AND 
ENTERTAINMENT ACROSS THE REGION 
AND PROBABLY REACHING BEYOND. 
BESIDES THAT I SEE OUR TREE 
LINED STREETS WITH NOTHING BUT 
EMERGENCY RESPONDERS LINED UP 
AND THEIR LIGHTS FLASHING. 
THIS ROAD THAT WE'RE SITTING ON 
ACTUALLY TURNS INTO THE 
BOULEVARD WHICH IS THE GATEWAY 
INTO OUR HISTORIC CAPITAL CITY 
OF ANNAPOLIS. 
WE'RE WITHIN 2 MILES OF THE 
STATEHOUSE WHERE WE'RE LOCATED 
NEAR THE WESTFIELD ANNAPOLIS 
MALL. 
>> JANE, WHAT KIND OF A 
NEIGHBORHOOD IS THIS? 
IS THIS SOMEWHERE -- IT LOOKS 
FROM WHAT WE CAN SEE FROM THE 
HELICOPTER SHOT, THIS LOOKS 
LIKE A SUBURBAN AREA, A PRETTY 
QUIET AREA. 
>> Reporter:  IT GENERALLY IS. 
GENERALLY THE WORST THING THIS 
TIME OF DAY IS RUSH HOUR 
TRAFFIC WHERE IT DOES PICK UP 
BECAUSE WE HAVE A HUGE COMMUTER 
COMMUNITY. 
ANNAPOLIS IS THE CAPITAL CITY 
OF MARYLAND. 
WE'RE WITHIN HALF AN HOUR OF 
BALTIMORE, WITHIN HALF AN HOUR 
OF WASHINGTON D.C., BUT I CAN 
TELL YOU IN OUR LOCAL CRIME 
REPORT WHICH WE BROADCAST EVERY 
MORNING FROM THE ANNAPOLIS 
POLICE DEPARTMENT, WE STILL 
MAKE MENTION OF STOLEN BIKES. 
SO IF THAT GIVES YOU ANY KIND 
OF A CONCEPT OF OUR REALITY 
NORMALLY, THIS IS NOT IT. 
>> JANE, WAS THERE ANY OTHER 
INFORMATION YOU WERE ABLE TO 
GLEAN FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT 
THERE? 
I KNOW THAT THEY GAVE TWO PRESS 
BRIEFINGS SO FAR. 
THERE WASN'T MUCH INFORMATION 
THAT WE HADN'T ALREADY HEARD. 
ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU'VE BEEN 
ABLE TO GATHER FROM EITHER LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OR WITNESSES YOU'VE 
BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK WITH? 
>> Reporter:  WE KNOW THAT 
THERE ARE FIVE FATALITIES. 
THERE ARE ADDITIONAL INJURIES. 
THEY HAVE SET UP A 
REUNIFICATION FOR FAMILY AND 
FRIENDS AT THE MALL THAT YOU 
CAN PROBABLY SEE, THE WESTFIELD 
ANNAPOLIS MALL. 
ONE THING YOU MAY NOT HAVE 
HEARD IS FROM OUR MAYOR GAVIN 
BUCKLEY. 
JUST LAST WEEK ON THURSDAY THEY 
COMPLETED AN ACTIVE ASSAILANT 
EXERCISE AT A LOCAL SCHOOL 
CAMPUS FOR THIS EXACT TYPE OF 
RESPONSE NEVER IMAGINING THAT 
WITHIN A FEW DAYS LATER WE'D BE 
TALKING ABOUT REAL FATALITIES. 
>> IS THIS WITH THE SAME POLICE 
FORCE THAT RESPONDED TO THIS 
SITUATION TODAY? 
>> Reporter:  THIS IS ONE OF 
THE MANY POLICE FORCES. 
THIS ROAD ACTUALLY IS ON THE 
CITY OF ANNAPOLIS AND COUNTY, 
ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY POLICE 
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE PRIMARY 
RESPONSE UNIT WITH THE 
ANNAPOLIS POLICE LITERALLY 
RIGHT BEHIND THEM. 
THEN WE'VE SEEN AGENCIES 
INVOLVED. 
I'VE BEEN TOLD 10 PLUS AGENCIES 
TO INCLUDE THE FBI, ATF AND 
OTHERS ARE INVOLVED. 
FROM WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TOLD, IT 
MAY HAVE BEEN A LONG GUN. 
THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS AN 
ASSAULT WEAPON THAT WAS USED 
AND AGAIN THERE ARE -- THEY ARE 
NOW ACTIVELY INTERVIEWING THE 
ONE AND THEY BELIEVE THE ONLY 
SUSPECT THIS HOUR. 
>> JANE, FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE 
COVERING CRIME IN THIS AREA IT 
SEEMS GIVEN THE FACT THERE WAS 
AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SCENARIO JUST 
RECENTLY THAT THIS WAS 
SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY ON 
THE MINDS OF LOCAL OFFICIALS. 
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT 
COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAD BEEN 
WORRIED ABOUT THAT THIS COULD 
HAPPEN IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD? 
>> Reporte:  I THINK THAT 
EVERY COMMUNITY HAS TO WORRY 
THAT THIS CAN HAPPEN IN THEIR 
OWN BACKYARD BASED ON WHAT 
WE'VE SEEN HAPPEN IN RECENT 
MONTHS IN, RECENT YEARS AND 
THESQUE -- MONTHS, IN RECENT 
YEARS AND THE ESCALATING 
VIOLENCE, PEOPLE VIOLENCE. 
I'M NOT SURE WE CAN BLAME IT ON 
THE GUNS ANYMORE, BUT WE'VE GOT 
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON 
WITH OUR PEOPLE. 
>> JANE SCHLEGEL, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH FOR JOINING US. 
WE'RE GOING BACK TO RON HOSKO, 
THE FORMER ASSISTANT FBI 
DIRECTOR AND CBS NEWS SECURITY 
ANALYST WHO IS ON THE PHONE 
WITH US. 
RON, WE'VE JUST LEARNED FROM A 
SENIOR FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICER THAT THE SUSPECT HAD 
FAKE GRENADES. 
WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? 
>> WELL, WHETHER HE WAS LOOKING 
TO USE DEVICES, WHETHER IT WAS 
SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING TO 
SOUND LIKE AN EXPLOSION OR MORE 
LIKELY SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING 
TO EMIT SMOKE. 
WAS HE GOING TO DO THAT IN A 
WAY TO COVER HIS EGRESS, HIS 
POTENTIAL ESCAPE? 
WAS HE GOING TO DO IT TO CREATE 
ADDITIONAL CONFUSION TO DEFEAT 
LAW ENFORCEMENT'S EFFORTS TO 
LOCATE HIM WITHIN THE BUILDING? 
HOPEFULLY WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT 
DOES HEAR HIS SIDE OF THE 
STORY, HOPEFULLY THEY WILL BE 
ABLE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH 
HIM AND UNDERSTAND IT AND 
EXPLOIT HIS DEVICES WHETHER 
IT'S COMPUTER, SOCIAL MEDIA, 
THAT THEY'LL GET A BETTER 
UNDERSTANDING OF HIS DRIVERS 
HERE, BUT IT COULD BE ANY OF 
THOSE THINGS. 
I THINK, AS I MENTIONED 
EARLIER, IF SOMEONE WERE TO 
BRING A DEVICE IN, THAT'S GOING 
TO AUTOMATICALLY HAVE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT DOUBLE THEIR 
WARINESS OF WHERE THEY GO, OF 
HOW THEY GO THERE, HOW QUICKLY 
THEY GO THERE BECAUSE SUDDENLY 
YOU HAVE TO ASSESS IS THERE A 
TRAP LAID FOR US THAT WILL TAKE 
DOWN MANY OF THE RESCUERS, 
BASICALLY HARM THE LAW 
ENFORCEMENT RESCUERS COMING IN? 
SO THAT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS 
THAT WILL SLOW DOWN A LAW 
ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE TO AN 
ACTIVE SHOOTER HERE. 
SO IT COULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING 
AS. 
>>> AS THAT, MAYBE JUST TO 
CREATE SOME -- AS SIMPLE AS 
THAT, MAYBE JUST TO CREATE SOME 
ADDITIONAL CONFUSION, BUY SOME 
TIME OR COVER AN ESCAPE. 
>> IT SEEMS SOMETHING LIKE 
THESE FAKE GRENADES WOULD BE 
LIKE A FLASH BANG THAT WOULD 
CREATE CONFUSION, SMOKE, CHAOS 
WHERE THERE UNFORTUNATELY WAS 
PLENTY OF CHAOS. 
RON, EARLIER YOU MENTIONED 
THERE HAVE BEEN FBI STUDIES ON 
THESE SHOOTINGS. 
WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED FROM 
THESE STUDIES? 
WHAT PATTERNS ARE YOU SEEING? 
>> WELL, FIRST THERE WAS ONE  
THAT JUST CAME OUT VERY 
RECENTLY WHERE THE FBI AND 
OTHERS ARE LOOKING AT WHAT'S IN 
THE MINDS OF THESE MORE RECENT 
ACTIVE SHOOTERS? 
THEIR STUDIES CERTAINLY SHOW AN 
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER, THE 
FREQUENCY OF ACTIVE SHOOTING 
EVENTS. 
10 OR 15 YEARS AGO YOU MIGHT BE 
TALKING ABOUT A HANDFUL OF 
THESE PER YEAR, MAYBE FEWER 
THAN 10 AND NOW I THINK WE'RE 
TALKING MULTIPLES OF THAT. 
THEY'RE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO 
EVALUATE AND COMPARE IN KIND OF 
A CROSS-CUTTING WAY A STUDY OF 
MULTIPLE OFFENDERS TO LOOK FOR 
COMMONALITIES, TO LOOK FOR 
TRENDS. 
WE'VE SEEN THE TREND OF MENTAL 
ILLNESS THAT TRACKS THROUGH SO 
MANY OF THESE FOLKS, JARED 
LOUGHNER AND IN THE AURORA 
SHOOTING, AARON ALEXIS AT THE 
WASHINGTON NAVY YARD AND OTHERS 
WHO WERE ACTIVELY MENTALLY ILL. 
YOU COULD SEE IT AS SOON AS YOU 
SAW THE PICTURES OF THEM IN 
CUSTODY THAT THIS WAS SOMEBODY 
WHO IS SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL 
OR WHEN THEY TALKED TO THE 
FIRST RELATIVE, THEY KNEW THIS 
WAS MENTAL ILLNESS, BUT THERE 
ARE OTHERS, TOO. 
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ANGRY 
OUT THERE, WHO ARE DISAFFECTED. 
WE SAW IT IN FLORIDA, THAT YOU 
JUST HAVE SOMEBODY WHO OVER 
TIME APPEARS TO START TO BE 
SOCIOPATHIC AND THERE IS A LONG 
TREND AND A LONG WARM-UP, MAYBE 
WEEKS LONG OR LONGER AS THEY 
STUDY THEIR TARGET, AS THEY 
CONTEMPLATE WHO THEIR  TARGETS 
ARE GOING TO BE. 
SO THERE IS CERTAINLY NO ONE 
PERSON. 
OR DESCRIPTOR OF AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER -- NO ONE PERSON OR 
DESCRIPTOR OF AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER. 
THAT'S WHY WE KEEP HEARING FROM 
LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE ARE 
SIGNS. 
FOR THOSE AROUND THESE PEOPLE 
THERE ARE SIGNS. 
WE SAW IT, OF COURSE, IN THE 
FLORIDA SHOOTING. 
IT'S COMMON IN SO MANY OF THESE 
SHOOTINGS. 
I THINK THE FBI'S ESTIMATES ARE 
AS MANY AS 80% OR EVEN HIGHER 
WHERE THERE ARE INDICATORS OF, 
YOU KNOW, NOT ONLY MENTAL 
ILLNESS, BUT GATHERING STEAM, 
GATHERING WEAPONS, STARTING TO 
CONTEMPLATE THEIR TARGETS, 
TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE IN A WAY 
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS A 
POTENTIAL ATTACKER. 
SO WE CONSTANTLY HEAR FROM LAW 
ENFORCEMENT THAT WE ALL HAVE A 
RESPONSIBILITY HERE AND THAT'S 
TO BE LOOKING OUT OVER OUR 
NEIGHBORS, OUR FRIENDS, OUR 
FAMILY MEMBERS AND SAYING LOOK, 
AM I IN CONTACT WITH SOMEBODY 
WHO LITERALLY IS TICKING, WHO 
IS FLASHING RED LIKE THE 
FLORIDA SHOOTER WAS? 
AND WHAT'S MY OBLIGATIONS? 
SOMEHOW TALK TO LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
IN THAT CASE OBVIOUSLY LAW 
ENFORCEMENT FAILED ON MANY 
LEVELS, BUT IT IS THE GOAL TO 
SPOT THESE FOLKS BEFORE IT 
HAPPENS, SOMEHOW GET TO THEM 
WHETHER IT'S WITH AN ARREST FOR 
SOMETHING ELSE, WHETHER IT'S 
PSYCHOLOGICAL HELP, WHETHER 
IT'S HELPING A SCHOOL, HOW YOU 
HANDLE AN EMPLOYEE THAT YOU'RE 
GOING TO TERMINATE AND TRY TO 
GET IN FRONT OF THESE EVENTS 
BEFORE THEY TURN OUT TRAGIC 
LIKE TODAY DID. 
>> THE RESPONSIBILITY FALLS ON 
US ALL. 
RON, THE SUSPECT REPORTEDLY HAS 
NOT BEEN COOPERATING WITH 
POLICE. 
WHAT WILL LAW ENFORCEMENT BE 
LOOKING FOR AS THEY TRY TO FIND 
OUT MORE ABOUT HIM? 
>> WELL, THEY BY NOW I WOULD 
THINK HAVE HIM FINGERPRINTED 
AND VERY LIKELY IDENTIFIED. 
VERY OFTEN THESE FOLKS HAVE A 
CRIMINAL HISTORY AND THERE ARE 
PLATFORMS. 
I KNOW THAT THE FBI USES THAT 
POLICE HAVE THAT CAN CAPTURE 
FINGERPRINTS DIGITALLY, RUN 
THEM OFF KNOWN DATABASES AND 
VERY LIKELY IDENTIFY SOMEONE IF 
THEY EVEN NEED TO DO THAT. 
IT COULD BE THIS IS A FORMER 
EMPLOYEE THERE, SOMEBODY FROM 
THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND PEOPLE 
KNOW WHO THIS IS. 
EVERY, BUT THEY ARE CERTAINLY 
GOING TO BE -- THIS IS, BUT 
THEY ARE CERTAINLY GOING TO BE 
EXECUTING SEARCH WARRANTS AT 
HIS RESIDENCE, ON HIS DEVICES, 
ANY I.T. 
THAT HE'S TOUCHED IN WEEKS OR 
MONTHS TALKING TO FRIENDS, 
FAMILY, CO-WORKERS AND TRYING 
TO PAINT A PICTURE WITHOUT HIS 
COOPERATION. 
IT COULD BE -- 
>> I'M GOING TO JUST JUMP IN 
THERE, RON. 
WE'RE HEARING NOW FROM LAW 
ENFORCEMENT FOR THE THIRD 
BRIEFING OF THE DAY. 
>> A BRIEF UPDATE FOR SOME OF 
THE INFORMATION, THAT WE COME 
OUT AND GIVE YOU GUYS A BRIEF 
UPDATE FOR SOME OF THE 
INFORMATION THAT WE'VE LEARNED 
OR COME TO KNOW THROUGH 
INVESTIGATION, SOME OF THE 
QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAD EARLIER 
WE'LL HAVE SOME ANSWERS FOR. 
UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL HAVE 
SOME THAT WE CAN'T ANSWER, BUT 
WE DO HAVE AN UPDATE. 
WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER. 
>> I'M COUNTY EXECUTIVE STEVE 
SCHU. 
AS WE REPORTED EARLIER TODAY, 
THERE'S BEEN A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY 
HERE IN ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY. 
THERE WAS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER 
INCIDENT. 
FIVE PEOPLE ARE DEAD. 
SEVERAL MORE ARE WOUNDED IN 
CARE. 
THE SHOOTER IS IN CUSTODY BEING 
INTERROGATED AS WE SPEAK. 
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE 
TREMENDOUS WORK OF OUR PUBLIC 
SAFETY PROFESSIONALS TODAY, 
PARTICULARLY THE ANNE ARUNDEL 
POLICE DEPARTMENT, THE 
ANNAPOLIS CITY POLICE 
DEPARTMENT AND THE ANNE ARUNDEL 
SHERIFF'S OFFICE. 
THEY WERE ON THE SCENE IN ABOUT 
60 SECONDS, BUT BEYOND THAT 
THEY WENT IMMEDIATELY INTO THAT 
BUILDING WITHOUT A MOMENT'S 
HESITATION AND DEMONSTRATED 
INCREDIBLE COURAGE AND WE ARE 
SO DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE OF THEIR 
GREAT WORK. 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE. 
GOVERNOR HOGAN. 
>> WELL, I WANT TO THANK YOU 
ALL FOR BEING HERE. 
OBVIOUSLY OUR HEART GOES OUT TO 
THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES 
AND I JUST WANT TO REITERATE, 
IT'S ALL THREE COUNTY AGENCIES, 
THE CITY POLICE FORCE, COUNTY 
POLICE, THE SHERIFF'S 
DEPARTMENT. 
WE HAVE 10 DIFFERENT OTHER 
AGENCIES BACKING THEM UP. 
ALL THE STATE POLICE AGENCIES 
ARE HERE AS WELL, FEDERAL 
PARTNERS. 
IT'S A TRAGIC SITUATION, BUT 
THERE WERE SOME VERY BRAVE 
PEOPLE THAT CAME IN AND KEPT IT 
FROM BEING WORSE AND THE 
RESPONSE TIME WAS INCREDIBLE. 
SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. 
>> CHIEF? 
>> GOOD AFTERNOON. 
I PROMISED YOU GUYS AN UPDATE. 
DEPUTY CHIEF WILLIAM CRANSTON 
WITH THE ANNE ARUNDEL POLICE 
DEPARTMENT. 
SO THE BUILDING AS WE SPEAK IS 
NOW TACTICALLY SECURED AND WHAT 
THAT MEANS IS OUR S.W.A.T. 
TEAM AND OUR QUICK RESPONDERS 
HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE BUILDING. 
IT IS SECURE AS FAR AS THERE 
ARE NO MORE PERSONS IN THE 
BUILDING THAT ARE A THREAT TO 
ANYONE ELSE. 
WE DID RECOVER WHAT WE THOUGHT 
MAY HAVE BEEN AN EXPLOSIVE 
DEVICE. 
THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF. 
WE HAVE MEMBERS OF THE BOMB 
SQUAD ON SCENE. 
WE DON'T ANTICIPATE HAVING ANY 
MORE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES. 
WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW THAT YOU 
SEE BEHIND ME IS THAT OUR 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 
DIVISION, THE ACTUAL 
INVESTIGATORS ARE NOW TAKING 
OVER THE SCENE. 
WE HAVE RELEASED IT TO OUR 
MEMBERS OF THE CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATION DIVISION SO THEY 
CAN START THE PROCESS OF 
IDENTIFYING WHAT OCCURRED AND 
HOW IT OCCURRED AND WHY IT 
OCCURRED. 
SO AT THIS TIME WE HAD OVER 170 
INDIVIDUALS IN THE BUILDING 
THAT WERE ESCORTED OUT SAFELY. 
THEY WERE TAKEN TO A 
REUNIFICATION AREA OVER AT THE 
ANNAPOLIS MALL. 
WE BROUGHT JEN CORBIN IN FROM 
OUR CRISIS INTERVENTION TEAM 
WHO IS GOING TO SAY A FEW WORDS 
IN A MOMENT TO TALK WITH THE 
WITNESSES, SOME OF THE VICTIMS 
AND THE POLICE OFFICERS WHO 
RESPONDED. 
AT THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO 
CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION AND 
WE'LL HAVE AN UPDATE FOR YOU 
LATER ON THIS EVENING AND I 
BELIEVE RYAN IS GOING TO GIVE 
YOU A TIME FOR THAT. 
>> JEN? 
>> HI. 
I'M JEN CORBIN WITH ANNE 
ARUNDEL COUNTY CRISIS RESPONSE. 
WE HAVE BEEN ON SEVERAL 
DIFFERENT SITES WORKING WITH 
BOTH WITNESSES AND POLICE 
OFFICERS FOLLOWING THE 
INCIDENT. 
WE WILL BE WORKING CONTINUOUSLY 
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT BOTH TO ON 
A PHONE LINE AND THROUGHOUT TO 
-- BOTH ON A PHONE LINE AND 
THROUGHOUT TO ASSIST. 
WE WILL BE WORKING WITH BOTH 
THE WITNESSES AND OFFICERS THE 
NEXT DAY OR SO. 
THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE AVAILABLE 
FOR THROUGHOUT. 
>> THANK YOU, JEN. 
I HAVE ONE MORE ITEM. 
THIS AREA, THE AREA OF THE MALL 
AND THE ROAD WILL BE CLOSED FOR 
AN INDEFINITE AMOUNT OF TIME. 
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHEN IT'S 
GOING TO REOPEN AT THIS POINT. 
SO IF YOU'VE RECEIVED CALLS, 
PLEASE LET THEM KNOW WHAT 
OCCURRED AND WHY WE HAVE IT 
SHUT DOWN. 
THE INVESTIGATION IS GOING TO 
CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING HOURS 
AND AT THAT TIME WHEN WE GET 
MORE INFORMATION, I WILL HAVE 
ANOTHER UPDATE FOR YOU. 
>> Reporter:  DID YOU OR THE 
STATE'S ATTORNEY FEEL THE 
SUSPECT WAS COOPERATIVE? 
>> THE SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY. 
THEY'RE INTERVIEWING HIM NOW. 
THE ONLY OTHER INFORMATION I 
HAVE FROM QUESTIONS ASKED 
EARLIER IS WE DON'T HAVE AN 
IDENTIFICATION ON HIM YET. 
HE'S A WHITE ADULT MALE AND THE 
GUN USED IS DESCRIBED AS A LONG 
GUN. 
I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFICS ON 
THAT, BUT WE DO KNOW IT IS A 
LONG GUN. 
AS WE CONTINUE TO GET 
INFORMATION, WE WILL CONTINUE 
TO PUT THAT OUT. 
>> Reporter:  WHAT ABOUT THE 
MOTIVE? 
>> WE HAVE NO INFORMATION. 
HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY BY 
OFFICERS. 
THERE WAS NO GONE FIRE 
EXCHANGED BETWEEN OFFICERS AND 
THE SUSPECT. 
SINCE WE WERE ABLE TO GET HERE 
VERY QUICKLY AND SOMETHING FOR 
YOU GUYS TO KNOW, WE HAVE A 
UNIFIED TRAINING HOW TO RESPOND 
TO ACTIVE SHOOTERS. 
THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR THINGS 
THAT MADE THIS A HUGE SUCCESS. 
SO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES 
AROUND THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES 
TRAINED THE SAME WAY FOR THESE 
ACTIVE SHOOTERS SINCE WE'VE HAD 
CRITICAL INCIDENTS LIKE THIS. 
I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT'S VERY 
EASY, BUT IT'S VERY EASY FOR 
OFFICERS TO GET TOGETHER FROM 
OTHER JURISDICTIONS, LINK UP, 
KNOW THE TERMINOLOGY THAT'S 
NEEDED TO GO IN AND EFFECTIVELY 
LOCATE A SUSPECT IN AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER SITUATION AND TAKE CARE 
OF THAT TARGET INSIDE THERE 
DURING AN ACTIVE SHOOTER. 
SAY THAT AGAIN. 
>> Reporter:  DID HE SHOOT 
THROUGH WINDOWS OR DOORS? 
HOW DID HE ENTER THE BUILDING? 
>> I CAN'T ANSWER THIS RIGHT 
NOW. 
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL BE 
DETERMINED BY OUR INVESTIGATORS 
AS THEY PROCESS THAT CRIME 
SCENE. 
WE ANTICIPATE HAVING ANOTHERUP 
DATE AT 8:00. 
ANY NEW INFORMATION I'LL GIVE 
OUT THEN AND MAKE SURE YOU GUYS 
HAVE ALL THAT INFORMATION AND 
ANY UPDATES WITH. 
>> Reporter:  HOW MANY ARE IN 
THE HOSPITAL? 
-- UPDATES. 
>> Reporter:  HOW MANY ARE IN 
THE HOSPITAL? 
>> WE CAN CONFIRM FIVE ARE 
DECEASED. 
WE'RE WORKING ON INJURIES TO 
GET A GOOD NUMBER, BUT IT'S 
ESTIMATED AROUND THREE. 
>> Reporter:  HOW MANY WERE IN 
THE NEWSROOM WHEN THIS 
HAPPENED? 
>> I DON'T KNOW, BUT WE HAD 
APPROXIMATELY 170 WE SAFELY 
EVACUATED OUT OF THAT BUILDING 
AND TRANSPORTED TO MEET WITH 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS AT THE 
ANNAPOLIS MALL. 
8:00 WILL BE OUR NEXT UPDATE. 
I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER ANSWERS 
FOR YOU. 
ANY OTHER UPDATES WE'LL GET OUT 
AT 8:00. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> THAT CONCLUDES THE THIRD 
PRESS BRIEFING OF THE DAY FROM 
ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND, OUTSIDE 
THE CAPITAL GAZETTE IN 
ANNAPOLIS, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE 
BALTIMORE SUN NEWSPAPER. 
THERE WAS A SHOOTER THAT 
ENTERED THAT BUILDING THIS 
AFTERNOON, OPENED FIRE WITH A 
SHOTGUN. 
HE SHOT THROUGH A GLASS WINDOW 
OR DOOR AND I SAY HE BECAUSE WE 
KNOW HE'S A MAN. 
WE KNOW HE'S IN HIS 20s. 
WE KNOW HE'S WHITE. 
WE KNOW HE'S CURRENTLY BEING 
INTERROGATED BY DETECTIVES, BUT 
HE'S NOT GIVING HIS NAME. 
HE'S NOT COOPERATING AND HE HAS 
NO ID ON HIM. 
POLICE HAVE JUST SAID THAT IN 
ADDITION TO THE FIVE PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE BEEN KILLED, THERE ARE AN 
ESTIMATED THREE WHO HAVE BEEN 
HURT. 
THEY'VE BEEN TAKEN TO AREA 
HOSPITALS. 
WE'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT A 
POTENTIAL EXPLOSIVE DEVICE 
WHICH WAS ON THE SCENE HAS BEEN 
"TAKEN CARE OF," HAS BEEN 
NEUTRALIZED. 
CBS NEWS ALSO LEARNED THAT 
THERE WERE FAKE GRENADES AT THE 
SCENE, FLASH BANGS THAT EMIT 
SMOKE, CREATE CONFUSION. 
THOSE WERE ALSO RECOVERED AT 
THE SCENE. 
THERE WERE MULTIPLE LAYERS OF 
LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO HAVE BEEN 
THERE THROUGHOUT THE DAY, 
LOCAL, FEDERAL, COUNTY, STATE 
POLICE ALL THERE WORKING TO TRY 
TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER. 
SITTING TO MY LEFT IS PAUL 
VIOLAS, A CBS NEWS SECURITY 
ANALYSTS. 
PAUL, AS WE WERE WATCHING THIS  
WATCHING THIS PRESS BRIEFING, 
YOU SAID SEVERAL TIMES THIS 
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. 
>> IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND 
GRANTED WE HAVE LIMITED 
INFORMATION, BUT WHEN WE START 
LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION WE 
HAVE ON THIS PARTICULAR 
INDIVIDUAL, THE SHOOTING, WHERE 
IT OCCURRED, WHEN IT OCCURRED, 
THE FACT HE'S A WHITE MALE IN 
HIS 20s, THE FACT THAT HE'S NOW 
TRYING TO WITHHOLD HIS 
INFORMATION FROM LAW 
ENFORCEMENT BUT YET NOW WE 
UNDERSTAND THAT HE'S TRYING TO 
NOT DISCLOSE OR HE'S DONE 
SOMETHING TO PREVENT THEM FROM 
OBTAINING AS YOU WERE 
MENTIONING -- 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM OUR 
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM HERE AT CBS 
IS THAT THE SUSPECT DAMAGED HIS 
FINGERTIPS SO LAW ENFORCEMENT 
CANNOT IDENTIFY HIM. 
SO THESE ARE EXTREME MEASURES 
THAT HE TOOK TO HIDE HIS 
IDENTITY. 
>> RIGHT. 
AND THIS IS THE PART THAT 
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE WHEN 
WE HAVE THIS LIMITED 
INFORMATION, WE START BREAKING 
DOWN WHAT WE HAVE AND CLEARLY 
THIS DOES NOT SOUND LIKE A 
WORKPLACE VIOLENCE INCIDENT 
FROM A FORMER EMPLOYEE OR A 
CURRENT EMPLOYEE. 
>> WHY NOT? 
>> BECAUSE A WORKPLACE VIOLENCE 
INCIDENT IS GOING TO OCCUR FROM 
AN ACT FROM A SHOOTER THAT'S 
GOING TO HAVE AN AXE TO GRIND, 
IS GOING TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF 
DISDAIN TOWARDS THE WORKPLACE 
WHETHER IT'S CURRENT OR FORMER. 
I HAVE NEVER AND I'VE BEEN 
SPECIALIZING IN THAT SINCE THE 
MID-'80s, I HAVE NEVER ONCE 
SEEN THAT HAPPEN. 
A WORKPLACE VIOLENCE OFFENDER 
WANTS TO GET A POINT ACROSS, IS 
LOOKING FOR SPECIFIC 
INDIVIDUALS, SEEKS THEM OUT IN 
ORDER TO SEND A MESSAGE, HAS 
TOLD PEOPLE WHAT HE WAS GOING 
TO DO BEFORE HE DOES IT AND TO 
WHO HE WAS GOING TO DO IT TO, 
SO JUST THE OPPOSITE. 
HE'S NOT AT THAT POINT LOOKING 
TO HIDE HIS IDENTITY. 
HE WANTS PEOPLE TO KNOW WHO HE 
IS BECAUSE HE WANTS TO GET A 
MESSAGE ACROSS. 
A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BARTER 
THAT'S COMING INTO THE 
WORKPLACE THAT FOUND OUT THAT A 
FORMER PERSON, A GIRL FRIEND, A 
WIFE, WHATEVER, A SIGNIFICANT 
OTHER, IS NOW WITH SOMEBODY 
ELSE IS ANGRY AT THAT 
INDIVIDUAL, BUT THEY'RE ANGRY 
AT THE ENTIRE WORKPLACE. 
THEY WANT TO GET A MESSAGE 
ACROSS THAT THAT WAS THE ONE 
INDIVIDUAL, THAT WAS THE ONE 
GROUP, THE ONE PLACE HE 
COULDN'T CONTROL AND HE WANTS 
TO GET THE MESSAGE ACROSS THAT 
HE WAS SETTING THE RECORD 
STRAIGHT. 
SO HE'S NOT GOING TO 
INTENTIONALLY HIDE HIS 
IDENTITY. 
>> HE WANTS TO BE SEEN. 
>> HE WANTS TO BE SEEN AND HE 
WANTS TO BE HEARD. 
SO NOW WHEN WE SEE AN 
INDIVIDUAL THAT COMES INTO A 
WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE 
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND WE STILL 
DON'T KNOW WHERE THE SHOOTING 
OCCURRED, IF I'M CORRECT. 
WE DON'T KNOW THAT IT WAS A 
NEWSROOM. 
WE KNOW IT WAS IN A BUILDING 
THAT THEY'RE IN, BUT WE DON'T 
KNOW THAT IT WAS THERE AND WE 
KNOW THAT HE'S A WHITE MALE IN 
HIS 20s AND THAT'S ALL WE KNOW. 
NONE OF THAT MAKES SENSE OF WHY 
AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD WANT TO 
INTENTIONALLY HIDE THEIR 
IDENTITY, JUST THE OPPOSITE. 
>> WHAT KIND OF SUSPECTS HAVE 
YOU SEEN DAMAGE THEIR 
FINGERTIPS TO HIDE THEIR 
IDENTITY? 
I PRESUME TRYING TO RUB OFF THE 
SKIN SO THAT THE PRINTS DON'T 
COME THROUGH. 
>> RIGHT. 
GANG-RELATED INDIVIDUALS THAT 
I'VE WORKED IN THE PAST WITH 
THAT HAVE INTENTIONALLY TRIED 
TO USE ACIDIC TYPE OF SOLUTIONS 
TO MASQUERADE THEIR IDENTITY SO 
THEY COULDN'T BE FINGERPRINTED. 
THAT'S A GANG. 
THAT'S NORMALLY AFFILIATED WITH 
A GANG AND A VARIETY OF 
TERRORIST GROUPS. 
THE IRA USED TO DO IT AND I 
DON'T WANT TO CAST ASPERSIONS 
OR MAKE SPECULATIONS, BUT I CAN 
SAY CLEARLY WHAT I DO KNOW IS 
THIS IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH AN 
INDIVIDUAL THAT WOULD GO INTO A 
WORKPLACE FOR A WORKPLACE 
SHOOTING OR A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE-
RELATED INCIDENT OR EVEN 
SOMEBODY WITH AN AXE TO GRIND 
AGAINST THE MEDIA. 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO THAT 
EXTENT. 
THE FACT THIS INDIVIDUAL MADE 
THAT STEP AS YOU REPORTED, THAT 
THEY WERE DAMAGING THEIR 
FINGERTIPS TO WITHHOLD THEIR 
IDENTITY FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT, 
THAT PUTS US INTO AN ENTIRELY 
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. 
>> WHEN YOU HEAR THIS, IT MAKES 
ME THINK OF THE FACT THAT YOU 
POINTED OUT BEFORE IS HE 
BROUGHT IN A SLOT GUN INDICATED 
TO YOU THIS WAS PREMEDITATED. 
NOW WE KNOW HE DAMAGED HIS 
FINGERTIPS TO CONCEAL HIS 
IDENTITY BECAUSE HE KNEW HE 
WOULD BE FINGERPRINTED JUST 
UNDERLINES THE FACT THAT HE 
REALLY PLANNED THIS. 
>> NO QUESTION. 
AND THE OTHER PART OF THIS THAT 
WE STILL DON'T KNOW AND THIS IS 
THE PART GNAWING AT ME RIGHT 
NOW, WHERE DID THE SHOOTING 
OCCUR? 
WHERE DID THEY CAPTURE HIM? 
THEY GOT THERE IN 60 SECONDS, 
WHICH THANK GOD THEY DID, BUT 
WHERE DID THEY CAPTURE HIM? 
HE DOES ALL THIS AND THEN JUST 
LAYS HIS GO UP DOWN? 
I DON'T KNOW. 
THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO 
ME. 
DID THEY CATCH HIM WALKING OUT 
OF THE BUILDING. 
DID HE FULFILL HIS MISSION BY 
GOING TO A PARTICULAR PART OF 
THAT BUILDING, SHOOTING THE 
PEOPLE HE INTENDED TO AND AS HE 
EXITED THE POLICE CAUGHT HIM 
AND SURRENDERED. 
THAT'S A BIG ELEMENT OF OUR 
DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW. 
WE JUST DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER. 
>> WE SPILL HAVE RON HOSKO ON 
THE LINE, FORMER ASSISTANT FBI 
DIRECTOR AND CBS SECURITY 
ANALYST. 
RON, WERE YOU ABLE TO HEAR THAT 
PRESS BRIEFING? 
I THINK WE MAY HAVE JUST LOST 
RON. 
PAUL, WHAT I WAS GOING TO ASK 
RON IS WHAT DOES THE LOCATION 
OF THIS INCIDENT SAY TO YOU? 
THIS IS A NEWS ORGANIZATION. 
DOES THAT SUGGEST ANYTHING 
ABOUT A POSSIBLE MOTIVE? 
>> YES, IT CERTAINLY DOES. 
I DON'T WANT TO USE WORDS RIGHT 
NOW THAT COULD HAVE OUR VIEWERS 
GOING OFF IN A DIRECTION WE 
DON'T WANT THEM TO GO OFF INTO 
INTO THE EVENING, BUT REMEMBER 
SOMETHING. 
WHEN WE LOOK AND WE STUDY THE 
ATTACK AND BREAK DOWN THE 
BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS OF A 
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL THAT'S A 
SHOOTER, THERE ARE A LOT OF 
COMPONENTS FROM A BEHAVIORAL 
SIDE. 
YOU'RE BREAKING THIS DOWN IN 
FINE COMPONENTS. 
THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE SITTING 
WITH RIGHT NOW. 
WE HAVE THIS INDIVIDUAL 
INTENTIONALLY THAT HAS GONE TO 
THE EXTENT OF MASQUERADING HIS 
FINGERPRINTS, PICKED A 
WORKPLACE, BUT PICKED A 
BUILDING WHERE THE MEDIA IS SO 
HE GETS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE. 
I DON'T WANT TO GO FORWARD AND 
DROP THE BIG WORD, BUT I'M 
STARTING TO WONDER RIGHT NOW 
WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEANS WITH 
RESPECT TO THINK OF THE 
EXPOSURE. 
THINK OF THE BIG DROP IN THE 
BUCKET WITH RESPECT TO THE 
MESSAGE THAT IT'S SENDING. 
WE JUST HEARD FROM A CBS 
CORRESPONDENT ON THE GROUND 
TALKING ABOUT THE MASSIVE NEWS 
COVERAGE THIS IS GETTING. 
THIS IS MAKING ME START TO 
WONDER RIGHT NOW WHAT DIRECTION 
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WITH 
RESPECT TO THIS PARTICULAR 
INDIVIDUAL ESPECIALLY WITH THE 
FACT OF HOW EVASIVE HE IS WITH 
LAW ENFORCEMENT RIGHT NOW. 
>> THERE'S SO MANY QUESTIONS 
STILL THAT NEED ANSWERS. 
JUST TO RECAP WHAT WE KNOW SO 
FAR. 
THERE ARE FIVE PEOPLE DEAD IN 
ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND. 
THIS FOLLOWS A SHOOTING THAT 
HAPPENED THIS AFTERNOON WHERE A 
GUNMAN OPENED FIRE USING A 
SHOTGUN IN THE BUILDING THAT 
HOUSES THE CAPITAL GAZETTE. 
WE AND THE WORLD RECEIVED 
TWEETS FROM PEOPLE THERE WERE 
THERE, WHO ASKED FOR HELP. 
THERE IS A MAN WHO IDENTIFIES 
HIMSELF AS AN INTERN. 
SO IMAGINE HOW YOUNG HE MUST BE 
WHO SAID, " ACTIVE SHOOTER." 
HE GAVE THE ADDRESS WHERE THEY 
WERE AND WROTE, " PLEASE HELP 
US." 
TO IMAGINE THE FEAR HE MUST 
HAVE BEEN FEELING AT THAT TIME 
AND YET HAD THE PRESENCE OF 
MIND TO TRY TO SEND A SIGNAL 
ASKING FOR HELP. 
WE'VE ALSO RECEIVED DIRECT 
REPORTS FROM ONE OF THE 
REPORTERS IN THAT ROOM. 
HE IS A CRIME REPORTER WHO 
TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE 
SHOOTER SHOT THROUGH THE GLASS 
TO ENTER THE ROOM AND THAT HE 
SAW HIS COLLEAGUES GUNNED DOWN, 
THAT HE WASN'T COMFORTABLE 
ASCERTAINING WHETHER OR NOT 
PEOPLE WERE DEAD OR ALIVE. 
HE ALSO GAVE A QUOTE TO THE 
BALTIMORE SUN THAT SAID, "I'M A 
POLICE REPORTER. 
I WRITE ABOUT THAT STUFF, NOT 
NECESSARILY TO THIS EXTENT, BUT 
SHOOTINGS AND DEATH ALL THE 
TIME, BUT AS MUCH AS TIME GOING 
TO TRY TO ARTICULATE HOW 
TRAUMATIZING IT IS TO BE HIDING 
UNDER YOUR DESK, YOU DON'T KNOW 
UNTIL YOU'RE THERE AND YOU FEEL 
HELPLESS." 
WE HAVE HEARD HEARTWRENCHING 
REPORTS FROM PEOPLE AT THIS 
NEWSPAPER. 
THE METRO EDITOR FOR THE 
CAPITAL GAZETTE RELEASED A 
STATEMENT THAT REALLY TALKED 
ABOUT THE MISSION AND THE 
PASSION OF REPORTERS AT THIS 
PAPER AND HE SAID, " WE TRY TO 
EXPOSE CORRUPTION. 
WE TRY TO GET ACCESS TO PUBLIC 
RECORDS TO BRING LIGHT TO THE 
INNER WORKINGS OF GOVERNMENT 
DESPITE MAJOR HURDLES IN OUR 
WAY. 
THE REPORTERS AND EDITORS PUT 
ALL INTO FINDING THE TRUTH. 
THAT IS OUR MISSION." 
HE IS REALLY DEFENDING WHAT 
THEY DO.  
HE SAYS IN THIS STATEMENT THERE 
ARE NO 40 HOUR WORKWEEKS HERE. 
THERE ARE NO BIG PAYDAYS. 
THESE ARE PEOPLE COMMITTED TO 
JOURNALISM WHO ARE TRYING TO 
BRING TRUTH TO THEIR COMMUNITY 
AND NOW THE BIGGEST STORY IN 
THE COUNTRY IS UNFOLDING IN 
THEIR OWN BUILDING. 
THE CRIME REPORTER WHO IS SO 
USED TO REPORTING ON SHOOTINGS 
THAT HAPPEN ELSEWHERE REALLY 
SPOKE ABOUT THE DISBELIEF THIS 
WAS HAPPENING WHERE IT DID 
HAPPEN. 
AGAIN WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT 
THERE ARE FIVE FATALITIES. 
THE INFORMATION THAT WE GOT 
FROM A POLICE BRIEFING THAT 
ENDED MINUTES AGO IS THEY SAY 
AT LEAST THREE PEOPLE ARE 
INJURED. 
WE SAW ONE OF THOSE INJURED 
EVACUATED BY A HELICOPTER TO A 
NEARBY HOSPITAL. 
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE VICTIMS 
AT AT LEAST TWO AREA HOSPITALS. 
WITH ME NOW IS PAUL VIOLAS. 
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO BREAK DOWN 
THE MOTIVATION AND POSSIBLE 
MENTALITY OF THE SHOOTER. 
HE IS IN POLICE CUSTODY AND 
BEING INTERROGATED AS WE SPEAK 
BY DETECTIVES. 
WHAT ARE THOSE KEY QUESTIONS 
THAT THEY'RE ASKING HIM? 
>> THEY'RE GOING TO REALLY TRY 
TO SET HIM AT EASE RIGHT NOW.
THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE 
HIM AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE 
AND DEVELOP A RAPPORT. 
THE SUPERVISOR NOW IN CHARGE OF 
THE DETECTIVES THAT ARE 
INTERVIEWING IS GOING TO 
CAREFULLY SELECT THE RIGHT 
PERSON, THE RIGHT INVESTIGATOR, 
THE RIGHT DETECTIVE THAT'S 
GOING TO HAVE THE BEST RAPPORT, 
THAT'S GOING TO CLICK WITH THIS 
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL. 
THE KEY QUESTIONS THEY WANT TO 
UNDERSTAND IS MORE ABOUT THE 
PERSON'S BACKGROUND, WHO HE IS, 
WHERE HE'S FROM, WHY HE CAME 
THERE, HOW HE CAME THERE, DID 
HE DRIVE THERE. 
THEY'RE GOING TO ASK HIM 
QUESTIONS THAT ARE NOT GOING TO 
SOUND TO THE PERSON WHO IS 
BEING INTERVIEWED AS BEING 
INVASIVE, BUT THEY ARE ACTUALLY 
INVASIVE. 
HOW DID YOU GET THERE TODAY OR 
WHERE ARE YOU FROM ORIGINALLY, 
BENCHMARK QUESTIONS TO HELP 
IDENTIFY HIM. 
WHENEVER YOU HAVE A SITUATION 
WHERE YOU HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL 
THAT IS NOT DISCLOSING THEIR 
IDENTITY, THAT'S OBSTRUCTING 
THE INVESTIGATION BY PREVENTING 
THAT, THEY'RE GOING TO ASK MORE 
OBSCURE QUESTIONS THAT WILL NOT 
ALERT THEM TO THAT FACT BUT 
BRING THEM TO THE POINT WHERE 
THAT WILL ASSIST THEM IN 
IDENTIFYING WHO THIS PERSON IS. 
THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO 
GO RIGHT NOW. 
>> IF THEY CAN'T RUN HIS 
FINGERPRINTS BECAUSE WE KNOW 
THAT HE'S DONE SOMETHING TO TRY 
TO DAMAGE HIS FINGERTIPS SO 
THAT HIS FINGERPRINTS CAN'T BE 
DETECTED AND CAN'T BE RUN 
THROUGH THE SYSTEM, HOW ARE 
THEY GOING TO FIGURE OUT WHO 
THIS GUY IS? 
>> BELIEVE IT OR NOT, SOONER OR 
LATER AND PROBABLY SOONER 
THEY'LL COME TO THE MEDIA AND 
PUT THIS PERSON'S FACE ON THE 
TELEVISION AND IT WON'T TAKE 
LONG AFTER THAT BEFORE HE'S 
IDENTIFIED. 
THEY'RE GOING TO USE THAT. 
THEY'RE GOING TO TELL THEM 
LOOK, WE DON'T WANT TO PUT YOUR 
FACE OUT THERE. 
IF YOU HAVE FAMILY, IF YOU HAVE 
FRIENDS, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO 
EMBARRASS THEM, IF YOU DON'T 
WANT TO HUMILIATE THEM, LET US 
KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND WE'LL TRY 
TO WORK THROUGH THIS. 
THEY'LL TRY TO ESTABLISH THAT 
RAPPORT, BUT THE MEDIA WILL BE 
THEIR BEST FRIEND BECAUSE IF 
HE'S GOING TO PLAY HARDBALL, 
THEY'LL PUT HIS FACE OUT THERE. 
HE'S NOT A MINOR. 
HE'S IN HIS 20s. 
THEY CAN PUT HIS FACE OUT THERE 
AND PUTTING HIS FACE OUT THERE 
AND USING TWO THINGS, FACIAL 
RECOGNITION, ARTIFICIAL 
INTELLIGENCE SOFTWARE AND USING 
THE MEDIA, THEY'LL FIND OUT WHO 
HE IS. 
IT'S NOT GOING TO TAKE THAT 
LONG. 
>> SPEAKING OF TECHNOLOGY, 
EARLIER WE DISCUSSED HOW 
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS USED 
TO SCAN THROUGH SECURITY VIDEO 
AT THE SCENE. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 
THAT TO US AND ALSO IN THE AGE 
OF CELL PHONES, HOW HAS THAT 
CHANGED THE GAME IN THESE TYPES 
OF SCENARIOS? 
>> AI IS PRETTY FASCINATING. 
THINK ABOUT TEACHING A CAMERA 
HOW TO THINK AND HOW TO 
REMEMBER AND HOW TO PROCESS. 
IT ACTUALLY TAKES SOMETHING, AN 
OBJECT, A PICTURE, A SOUND, A 
MOTION AND IT MAKES IT LEARN 
WHEN IT HEARD IT BEFORE, WHERE 
IT HEARD IT BEFORE AND IT MAY 
NOT JUST BE A FACE. 
IT COULD BE CLOTHING. 
IT COULD BE THIS PARTICULAR 
OUTFIT. 
IT COULD BE ANYTHING ABOUT THAT 
PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL AND IT 
WILL PROCESS THAT THROUGH 
HUNDREDS OF COMPUTERS LOOKING 
TO PROCESS WHERE THAT 
INDIVIDUAL WAS SEEN BEFORE. 
IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE FASCINATING 
AND YOU KNOW IN A METRO AREA 
THAT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS 
DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT THIS 
PARTICULAR AREA IN PUBLIC 
FACING CAMERAS. 
SO YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT 
THAT INFORMATION WHICH IS BEING 
PROCESSED RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE 
GOING THROUGH THAT TO LOCATE 
ANYTHING THAT THEY CAN WITH 
RESPECT TO THIS INDIVIDUAL, 
WHERE HE CAME FROM, WHERE HE 
LEFT FROM, CARS THAT HE GOT IN, 
PLATES THAT WERE BEHIND THAT, 
ANYBODY HE ASSOCIATED WITH, WHO 
THEY WERE, ET CETERA. 
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT 
NOW. 
THAT'S THE KEY BEHIND THAT 
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, QUITE 
FASCINATING. 
>> MY MIND KEEPS GOING BACK TO 
THE DECEASED. 
THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS ARE 
PROBABLY RUSHING TO THAT 
LOCATION THAT POLICE HAVE TOLD 
PEOPLE TO GO TO BE REUNITED 
WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND I 
REMEMBER WHEN WE COVERED THE 
PARKLAND SHOOTING HOW MANY 
FAMILIES TOLD US THEY DIDN'T 
HAVE ANSWERS AND THEY WERE 
WAITING AT THAT MEETING POINT 
IN PARKLAND WHICH WAS THE LOCAL 
MARRIOTT HOTEL TO FIND OUT 
WONDER. 
HOW LONG DOES IT USUALLY TAKE 
IF THERE IS A USUAL AMOUNT OF 
TIME, FOR PEOPLE AND POLICE TO 
BE ABLE TO GET TO THE POINT 
WHERE THEY CAN INFORM FAMILY 
MEMBERS OF THE WORST? 
>> UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T 
TAKE TOO LONG, ESPECIALLY IN A 
SITUATION LIKE THIS. 
NOW WE HAVE COVERED SO MANY 
THINGS HERE AT CBS TOGETHER, 
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING HERE, FIVE 
FATALITIES, WHICH IS HORRIFIC, 
IT'S NOT LIKE WE WERE LOOKING 
AT SOMETHING LIKE WHEN WE 
COVERED LAS VEGAS OR WHEN WE 
COVERED PARKLAND OR, YOU KNOW, 
A VARIETY OF OTHER SHOOTINGS, 
BUT STILL THOSE INDIVIDUALS 
WILL BE IDENTIFIED. 
THERE'S A STAGING AREA. 
IF YOU CAN KIND OF PICTURE 
THIS. 
THERE'S A STAGING AREA WHERE 
FAMILY AND FRIENDS WILL BE 
BROUGHT TO AND THEY'LL BE HELD 
TO THE SIDE. 
ANYBODY ASKING QUESTIONS, 
THEY'LL HAVE A POLICE 
PSYCHOLOGIST AND A VARIETY OF 
OTHER PEOPLE RELATED TO THE 
CITY THAT WILL BE THERE 
SPEAKING WITH THEM UNTIL BODIES 
ARE IDENTIFIED. 
ONCE THE CRIME SCENE IS SECURE, 
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO IDENTIF 
WHETHER THOSE ARE THEIR FAMILY  
IT COULD BE AN INDIVIDUAL FOUND 
THAT'S DECEASED HAS 
IDENTIFICATION ON THEM AND AN 
INDIVIDUAL THAT'S IN A TENT 
THAT'S WAITING AND THEY'LL KNOW 
THAT YES, IN FACT, I JUST LEFT 
THERE AND I'VE BEEN THROUGH 
THIS. 
I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO TELL YOU 
THE PIT THAT YOU GET IN YOUR 
STOMACH WHEN YOU'VE LEFT HA 
SCENE AND YOU WALK OUTSIDE -- 
THAT SCENE AND YOU WALK OUTSIDE 
AND YOU JUST SAW THAT PERSON 
AND YOU SEE AN INDIVIDUAL AND 
THEY'RE HOLDING UP A PICTURE 
SAYING I'M LOOKING FOR MY MOM 
OR I'M LOOKING FOR MY SON OR 
I'M LOOKING FOR MY DAUGHTER. 
HAVE YOU SEEN THEM AND YOU LOOK 
THEM STRAIGHT IN THE FACE AND 
THEY'RE SHOWING UP THAT PICTURE 
AND YOUR HEART IS GOING TO 
EXPLODE ND I DON'T CARE IF YOU 
HAVE THE BEST POKER FACE IN THE 
WORLD, IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE 
NOT TO SHOW THAT PERSON EMOTION 
THAT YOU JUST SAW THAT. 
POLICE HAVE A VERY ORGANIZED 
SYSTEM AS TO WHO CAN SPEAK TO 
THE VICTIMS AND WHO CAN DEAL 
WITH FAMILY. 
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT 
NOW, BUT I CAN TELL YOU 
UNQUIVOCALLY THIS IS THE WORST 
PART OF IT IS DELIVERING THAT 
MESSAGE. 
THERE IS NO GOOD WAY OF DOING 
IT. 
I HAVE BEEN IN THIS A LONG 
TIME. 
I WILL TELL YOU I'VE BEEN THE 
HEAD OF ONE OF THE LARGEST 
POLICE ACADEMIES IN THE 
COUNTRY. 
THERE IS NO RIGHT WAY TO TEACH 
SOMEBODY HOW TO DELIVER THAT 
MESSAGE. 
THAT IS WHAT'S GOING ON NOW AS 
WE SPEAK. 
>> LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS 
TAKING ON THAT BURDEN TO TALK 
TO FAMILY MEMBERS OF THOSE WHO 
HAVE BEEN KILLED, FIVE PEOPLE 
WHO LOST THEIR LIVES INSIDE A 
BUILDING THAT HOUSES THE 
CAPITAL GAZETTE IN ANNAPOLIS, 
MARYLAND. 
IT IS JUST -- THERE ARE NO 
WORDS. 
>> NO, THERE AREN'T, ABSOLUTELY 
NOT. 
>> FOR THOSE OF YOU JUST 
JOINING US, I'M ADRIANA DIAZ IN 
NEW YORK. 
WE WANT TO RECAP WHAT WE KNOW 
SO FAR. 
AT LEAST FIVE PEOPLE ARE DEAD 
AND AT LEAST THREE ARE WOUNDED 
AFTER A SHOOTING AT A NEWSPAPER 
IN ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND. 
WE'RE NOW LEARNING MORE ABOUT 
THE GUNMAN DESPITE HIS BEST 
EFFORTS. 
HE'S APPARENTLY GONE TO GREAT 
LENGTHS TO CONCEAL HIS 
IDENTITY, EVEN DAMAGING HIS 
FINGERTIPS TO AVOID 
FINGERPRINTING. 
POLICE A SHORT TIME AGO 
DESCRIBED HIM. 
>> WE KNOW HE'S A WHITE MALE, 
ADULT MALE, AND THE GUN USED IS 
DESCRIBED AS A LONG GUN. 
I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFICS ON 
THAT, BUT WE DO KNOW IT WAS A 
LONG GUN. 
AS WE CONTINUE TO GET 
INFORMATION, WE'LL CONTINUE TO 
PUT THAT OUT. 
WE'RE STILL DOING INTERVIEWS. 
>> Reporter:  HOW DID THEY 
CATCH HIM? 
>> HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY BY 
OFFICERS. 
THERE WAS NO GUNFIRE EXCHANGED 
BETWEEN OFFICERS AND THE 
SUSPECT. 
>> CBS NEWS KNOWS WHAT KIND OF 
GUN THAT WAS. 
IT WAS A SHOTGUN. 
THIS HAPPENED AT THE OFFICES OF 
THE CAPITAL GAZETTE, A DAILY 
PAPER OWNED BY THE BALTIMORE 
SUN MEDIA GROUP. 
PHIL DAVIS IS A CRIME REPORTER 
AT THE GAZETTE. 
TODAY HE FOUND HIMSELF 
REPORTING ON A CRIME AT HIS OWN 
WORKPLACE. 
HE TWEETED, "GUNMAN SHOT 
THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR TO THE 
OFFICE AND OPENED FIRE ON 
MULTIPLE EMPLOYEES, CAN'T SAY 
MUCH MORE AND DON'T WANT TO 
DECLARE ANYONE DEAD, BUT IT'S 
BAD," AND A SHORT TIME LATER HE 
WROTE, " THERE IS NOTHING MORE 
TERRIFYING THAN HEARING 
MULTIPLE PEOPLE GET SHOT WHILE 
YOU'RE UNDER YOUR DESK AND HEAR 
THE GUNMAN RELOAD." 
ANTHONY MESSENGER WHO DESCRIBES 
HIMSELF AS AN INTERN AT THE 
PAPER TWEETED THIS. 
"ACTIVE SHOOTER,  888 
BESGATE, THAT'S THE ADDRESS. 
>> WE ARE SO DEEPLY 
APPRECIATIVE OF THEIR GREAT 
WORK. 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE. 
>> MEANWHILE THERE ARE SOME 
VICTIMS OF THIS SHOOTING WHO 
ARE STILL NOT IN THE CLEAR. 
THEY'RE BEING TREATED AT LOCAL 
HOSPITALS. 
AS A PRECAUTION, POLICE IN NEW 
YORK AND CHICAGO HAVE ALSO BEEN 
DEPLOYED TO MEDIA ORGA WHILE 
THE NATURE OF THIS ATTACK IS 
BEING INVESTIGATED RIGHT NOW, 
ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO SPECIFIC 
THREAT AT THIS TIME TO OTHER 
MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS. 
WE'RE NOW JOINED BY MARYLAND 
CONGRESSMAN JOHN SARBINS. 
THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE IN YOUR 
DISTRICT. 
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP AND HOW 
ARE THE PEOPLE YOU'VE BEEN 
SPEAKING TO WHO HAVE BEEN 
AFFECTED BY THIS? 
>> WELL, THE FIRST THING TO SAY 
IS THAT THE RESPONSE TO THIS 
TRAGEDY WAS VIRTUALLY 
IMMEDIATE. 
IT WAS 60 SECONDS AND LAW 
ENFORCEMENT AND FIRST 
RESPONDERS WERE ON THE SCENE. 
THEY VERY QUICKLY GOT THE 
SITUATION UNDER CONTROL AND 
TOOK THE SHOOTER INTO CUSTODY 
WHICH MEANS THEY COULD TURN TO 
THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS 
IMPACTED BY THIS TRAGIC 
SHOOTING AND THAT'S WHERE THE 
ATTENTION REMAINS RIGHT NOW, 
MAKING SURE WHATEVER 
INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE GETS 
TO THE FAMILIES AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE. 
THERE'S A REUNIFICATION CENTER 
SET UP NEARBY. 
THERE'S A CRISIS HOTLINE THAT 
THE ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY 
GOVERNMENT HAS SET UP TO ANSWER 
QUESTIONS COMING IN FROM 
FAMILIES. 
THAT'S NOW THE FIRST ORDER OF 
BUSINESS NOW THAT THE SHOOTING 
SCENE HAS BEEN LOCKED DOWN AND 
IS UNDER CONTROL. 
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE 
FAMILIES ARE GETTING ALL THE 
INFORMATION THAT THEY CAN. 
>> CONGRESSMAN, THIS IS YOUR 
DISTRICT. 
THESE ARE YOUR PEOPLE. 
TELL US ABOUT THIS NEWSPAPER, 
ITS ROLE AND WHAT THAT MEANS 
FOR YOUR COMMUNITY. 
>> SO ANNAPOLIS IS A SMALL, 
VERY TIGHTLY KNIT COMMUNITY. 
PEOPLE KNOW EACH OTHER HERE. 
PEOPLE KNOW THE REPORTERS THAT 
REPORT FOR THE GAZETTE. 
SO THE IMPACT OF THIS IS GOING 
TO RIPPLE OUT IN ALL 
DIRECTIONS. 
THIS IS A HOMETOWN NEWSPAPER. 
THEY PUBLISH ARTICLES AND 
FEATURE STORIES ABOUT THINGS 
THAT ARE GOING ON AROUND TOWN. 
IT'S ALWAYS HAD THAT FEEL TO IT 
AND IT'S BEEN AROUND FOR A 
LONG, LONG TIME, DECADES AND 
DECADES. 
SO THERE'S REALLY A 
RELATIONSHIP THAT EXISTS 
BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE 
NEWSPAPER. 
SO TO HAVE THIS SHOOTING OCCUR 
RIGHT ON THE PREMISES OF THE 
NEWSPAPER OBVIOUSLY IS GOING TO 
SEND SHOCK WAVES. 
>> CONGRESSMAN, I'M SURE NO 
DOUBT YOU'VE HAD DEALINGS WITH 
THIS NEWSPAPER. 
I'M SURE THEIR REPORTERS HAVE 
INTERVIEWED YOU. 
DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO WAS IN 
THE BUILDING? 
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT YET 
BECAUSE THE IDENTITY OF THOSE 
AFFECTED IS STILL SOMETHING 
THAT HASN'T BEEN RELEASED. 
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO 
LEARN IN THE COMING DAYS THAT 
THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT I HAVE 
INTERACTED WITH AND ON MANY 
OCCASIONS I'VE HAD THE TUNE TO 
SIT WITH REPORTERS FROM THE 
GAZETTE. 
>> CONGRESSMAN, DO WE KNOW IF 
THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED INSIDE 
THE NEWSROOM OF THE GAZETTE? 
>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT 
DID HAPPEN ON THE PREMISES AT 
THE NEWSROOM. 
SO OBVIOUSLY YOU'LL HAVE MORE 
INFORMATION AS TO EXACTLY WHAT 
TRANSPIRED. 
AGAIN I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE 
HOW QUICK THE RESPONSE WAS HERE 
AND COMMEND LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
NOT ONLY WAS THE RESPONSE VERY 
TIMELY, ALMOST IMMEDIATE, AS I 
SAY, BUT IT WAS VERY 
COORDINATED. 
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF 
DIFFERENT LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICIALS AND JURISDICTIONS 
THAT CAME TOGETHER AND RIGHT 
BEHIND THAT A CRISIS 
INTERVENTION AND CRISIS 
RESPONSE TEAM SET UP THE 
REUNIFICATION CENTER AND MADE 
SURE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE 
DONE TO HELP THE FAMILIES IS 
BEING DONE. 
>> WE UNDERSTAND FROM THE MAYOR 
THAT THERE WAS AN ACTIVE 
SHOOTER TRAINING AS RECENT AS 
LAST WEEK. 
SO THIS IS SOMETHING LOCAL LAW 
ENFORCEMENT REALLY TRAINED FOR 
AND WAS REALLY AWARE OF TRYING 
TO PLAN FOR HOW THEY WOULD 
RESPOND TO THIS KIND OF EVENT. 
IN ONE OF YOUR TWEETS YOU SAID 
THAT YOUR OFFICE HAS 
ESTABLISHED LINES OF 
COMMUNICATION WITH THE FBI AND 
THE ATF. 
WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING FROM 
THEM? 
>> I THINK THEY HAVE THE SAME 
ANALYSIS AS THE LOCAL LAW 
ENFORCEMENT DOES. 
THEY WANT TO BE READY TO 
PROVIDE WHATEVER SUPPORT THEY, 
CAN BUT I CAN SAY THE LOCAL AND 
COUNTY OFFICIALS AND STATE 
OFFICIALS AND THEIR TEAMS HAVE 
REALLY DONE A TERRIFIC JOB IN 
TERMS OF WORKING TOGETHER TO 
MEET THE EMERGING NEEDS FROM 
THE SITUATION. 
SO I THINK THE SITUATION IS NOW 
UNDER CONTROL AND AGAIN THE 
IMPORTANT THING IS WE GET 
INFORMATION TO FAMILIES AS 
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. 
>> CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH FOR CHECKING IN WITH US. 
WE WANT TO BRING IN NOW 
MARYLAND DEMOCRATIC SENATOR BEN 
CARDIN. 
SENATOR, WE'VE SEEN YOUR TWEET. 
YOU WROTE THAT YOU ARE 
DEVASTATED AND REMAIN GRATEFUL 
TO FIRST RESPONDERS. 
WE WERE TOLD BY POLICE FIRST 
RESPONDERS WERE THERE WITHIN 60 
SECONDS. 
WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU 
HEARD THAT? 
>> WELL, FIRST WE ARE VERY 
GRATEFUL FOR THE FIRST 
RESPONDERS BECAUSE THEY GO INTO 
HARM'S WAY IN ORDER TO SAVE 
LIVES AND THEY CLEARLY 
RESPONDED IN A VERY 
PROFESSIONAL WAY. 
THIS IS SUCH A TRAGIC 
SITUATION. 
I KNOW THE ANNAPOLIS GAZETTE. 
IT'S A LOCAL PAPER THAT COVERS 
THE COMMUNITY. 
THE COMMUNITY IS VERY PROUD OF 
THE NEWSPAPER. 
THIS HAPPENING ANYWHERE IS 
TRAGIC, BUT IT'S SO HARD TO 
UNDERSTAND SOMEONE USING A 
SHOTGUN TO BREAK INTO THIS 
OFFICE AND KILLING PEOPLE. 
THE FIRST RESPONDERS CLEARLY 
ACTED VERY, VERY QUICKLY AND 
PROFESSIONALLY  AND GOT THE 
SITUATION, CONTROL AS QUICKLY 
AS POSSIBLE. 
UNFORTUNATELY SOME PEOPLE LOST 
THEIR LIVES AND OTHER PEOPLE 
ARE STILL AT RISK. 
>> SENATOR, WHEN YOU LAWMAKERS 
WHEN YOU'RE BACK ON CAPITOL 
HILL, WHAT MESSAGE WILL YOU 
BRING WITH YOU? 
>> WELL, THIS SHOULD NOT BE 
HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. 
WE'VE ALL GOT TO COME TOGETHER. 
THERE'S TOO MUCH VIOLENCE HERE 
IN AMERICA. 
WE MUST HAVE A STRATEGY TO HELP 
DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE. 
INACTION IS NOT AN OPPOSITE. 
WE DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS, 
THE MOTIVATION BEHIND THIS, BUT 
WE KNOW THERE'S JUST TOO MANY 
OF THESE SHOOTINGS. 
ONE IS TOO, BUT THE NUMBER -- 
IS TOO MANY, BUT THE NUMBER OF 
FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THIS IS 
CONCERNING SHOULD AFFECT ALL 
AMERICANS. 
>> DO YOU THINK GUN DEBATE WILL 
COME FROM THIS? 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
WE KNOW FROM PREVIOUS SHOOTINGS 
AND GUN VIOLENCE THAT, YOU'RE 
SO MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE A 
VICTIM OF GUN VIOLENCE IN THE 
UNITED STATES THAN ANY OTHER 
INDUSTRIAL NATIONS IN THE 
WORLD. 
WE KNOW THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT 
WE CAN DO. 
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD HAVE 
AN IMPACT ON THIS EPISODE, BUT 
CLEARLY WE NEED UNIVERSAL 
BACKGROUND CHECKS AND NEED TO 
GET RID OF THE MILITARY ASSAULT 
RIFLES AND PRIVATE OWNERSHIP. 
THOSE ARE TWO BASIC THINGS THAT 
CAN GET DONE THAT WOULD 
CERTAINLY HELP THE SITUATION. 
WE DO NEED A NATIONAL DIALOGUE 
AND WE NEED TO TAKE MULTIPLE 
STRATEGIES IN ORDER TO ADDRESS 
VIOLENCE IN OUR COMMUNITY. 
>> SENATOR, DO YOU THINK 
LAWMAKERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE 
AISLE CAN GET BEHIND THOSE 
POINTS? 
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY 
ATTEMPTS AT GUN REFORM IN THE 
PAST THAT HAVE FAILED. 
>> I UNDERSTAND THERE'S LIKE A 
90% PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR 
UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND 
THERE'S STILL OVERWHELMING 
SUPPORT FOR GETTING RID OF 
MILITARY STYLE WEAPONS. 
SO YES, I THINK WE CAN AND WE 
SAW FROM THE STUDENTS OF 
PARKLAND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO 
STAY ENGAGED IN OUR PROCESS TO 
GET ADULTS TO ACT AS ADULTS. 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL HAPPEN 
THIS YEAR, BUT I DO BELIEVE 
YOU'LL SEE PROGRESS ON THESE 
ISSUES. 
>> SENATOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
WE KNOW YOU'RE VERY BUSY TRYING 
TO HELP YOUR CONSTITUENTS. 
WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> LET'S GO BACK NOW TO PAUL 
VIOLAS, THE CBS NEWS SECURITY 
ANALYST. 
WE JUST STEPPED BACK AND LOOKED 
AT THE NATIONAL IMPLICATIONS 
SPEAKING TO THE NATIONAL 
LAWMAKERS WHO CALL MARYLAND 
HOME. 
LIKE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID, 
YOU NEVER THOUGHT THIS WOULD 
HAPPEN IN YOUR BACKYARD. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> I HAVE TO SAY THE MORE THIS 
HAPPENS, THE MORE WE'RE 
STARTING TO HEAR PEOPLE SAY WE 
KNEW IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF 
TIME. 
>> YOU KNOW THE FRIGHTENING 
PART ABOUT THIS IS THOSE 
RESPONSES HAVE RESONATED FROM 
COMMUNITY TO COMMUNITY TO 
COMMUNITY FOR THE LAST 20 OR 30 
YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING 
THIS CONVERSATION. 
THIS IS NOTHING NEW. 
I REMEMBER MANY, MANY YEARS AGO 
WHEN WE HAD THAT MASS SHOOTING 
IN BUCKHEAD, GEORGIA, AND 
YOU'VE GOT THIS MASS CASUALTY 
AND THE HEADLINES READ, "NOT 
HERE IN BUCKHEAD," AND IF YOU 
THINK BACK, EVERY TIME THERE'S 
A MASS SHOOTING, EVERY TIME 
THERE'S A SITUATION LIKE THIS, 
TOMORROW'S NEWSPAPER WILL READ 
THE SAME THING AND IT'S GOING 
TO READ SHOCK IN ANNAPOLIS, 
SHOCK HERE AND I WONDER WHAT 
IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOR US TO 
GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE 
REALIZE THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE 
SHOCKED, THAT THIS HAPPENS 
EVERYWHERE. 
THAT IT SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING  
WITH MORE AND MORE FREQUENCY. 
>> I AGREE. 
>> WE JUST RECEIVED A REPORT 
FROM OUR INVESTIGATIVE TEAM 
HERE AT CBS NEWS THAT SAYS 
INVESTIGATORS ARE NOW USING 
FACIAL RECOGNITION TO TRY TO 
IDENTIFY THE SUSPECT. 
AS WE DISCUSSED, THE SUSPECT 
HAS GONE TO MANY LENGTHS TO 
HIDE HIS IDENTITY. 
HE SOMEHOW DAMAGED HIS 
FINGERTIPS TO MAKE IT HARDER 
FOR HIM TO BE FINGERPRINTED. 
HE DIDN'T CARRY ANY ID WITH 
HIM. 
WE'RE SAYING HE BECAUSE WE KNOW 
HE'S A MAN IN HIS 20s AND IS 
WHITE AND USED A SHOTGUN. 
BEYOND THAT WE KNOW VERY LITTLE 
ABOUT THIS MAN. 
IT SOUNDS LIKE DETECTIVE ITS 
DON'T EITHER. 
THEY'RE INTERROGATING HIM NOW 
AS WE SPEAK ACCORDING TO 
POLICE. 
HOW EFFECTIVE IS FACIAL 
RECOGNITION SOFTWARE? 
>> IT'S ACTUALLY VERY 
EFFECTIVE. 
THIS IS THE THING WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT THE LAST HOUR OR 
SO, ABOUT ARTIFICIAL 
INTELLIGENCE. 
THIS INFORMATION IS INVALUABLE. 
THE TOOLS THAT DETECTIVES AND 
LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE AVAILABLE 
TO THEM TODAY IS QUITE 
SIGNIFICANT. 
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS 
INDIVIDUAL'S PICTURE AND IF WE 
BREAK THIS DOWN, TAKE THIS úIND 
IT INTO HUNDRED OF THOUSANDS 
OF CAMERAS, SERVERS THROUGHOUT 
THE ENTIRE AREA AND THAT FACIAL 
RECOGNITION SOFTWARE IS GOING 
TO LET THEM KNOW WHERE THAT 
PERSON'S BEEN SEEN. 
WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY MEAN? 
THINK ABOUT YOU AND I, ALL OF 
OUR VIEWERS AND WHAT WE DO ON A 
DAILY BASIS, WALKING TO GET A 
COUPLE OF COFFEE, GOING OUT TO 
DINNER, WALKING TO THE SUBWAY, 
GETTING INTO OUR CAR, GOING TO 
THE MALL. 
EVERYWHERE HAS CAMERAS. 
>> SO YOU'RE SAYING A PHOTO 
THEY TAKE OF HIM TODAY IS GOING 
TO REGISTER WITH JUST SECURITY 
CAMERAS FOOTAGE THAT'S CAPTURED 
HIM IN THE PAST? 
>> CORRECT. 
>> WE HAVE THAT TECHNOLOGY? 
>> WE HAVE THAT TECHNOLOGY. 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS PICK 
OF HIM AND RUN IT THROUGH EVERY 
AVAILABLE FACIAL RECOGNITION 
DATABASE THAT THEY HAVE IN THE 
ENTIRE AREA TO SEE WHERE HE'S 
BEEN BEFORE, WHO HE WAS WITH, 
WHAT HE WAS WEARING, WHAT HE 
WAS DRIVING, WHERE DID HE GO. 
SO AS MUCH AS THIS GUY THINKS 
THAT HE'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO 
NOT DISCLOSE THIS INFORMATION 
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE USE OF 
THIS TIME OF SOFTWARE IS GOING 
TO ENABLE US TO GET TO THE 
POSITION WHERE WE'LL KNOW WHO 
HE IS. 
>> IT WILL ALSO RUN THROUGH 
SYSTEMS THAT HAVE DRIVER'S 
LICENSE PHOTOS, MUGSHOTS, 
PASSPORT PHOTOS. 
>> PEOPLE HE'S ASSOCIATED WITH, 
CARS THAT HE'S DRIVEN, PLACES 
HE'S BEEN AND GO AFTER THOSE 
PEOPLE. 
I SAW YOU WERE WITH THIS 
PARTICULAR PERSON. 
WHO IS THIS PARTICULAR PERSON? 
>> SO IT CREATES A STORY. 
>> IT CREATES A BIG STORY AND 
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THAT 
IS WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. 
>> WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON 
HIS POSSIBLE MOTIVE BASED ON 
THE THINGS WE HAVE LEARNED SO 
FAR AND FOR OUR VIEWERS JUST 
JOINING US, WE KNOW THIS IS A 
SHOOTING AT THE CAPITAL GAZETTE 
NEWSROOM. 
IT HAPPENED IN THE NEWSROOM 
ACCORDING TO A CONGRESSMAN WE 
JUST HAD ON THE PHONE. 
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TALKING, 
WE THOUGHT MAYBE THAT MEANT HE 
MIGHT HAVE BEEN A DISGRUNTLED 
FORMER EMPLOYEE, IT MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN A DOMESTIC VIOLENCEISSUE, 
BUT THE FACT HE IS TRYING TO 
CONCEAL HIS IDENTITY BY 
DAMAGING HIS FINGERTIPS, WHAT 
DOES THAT TELL YOU, PAUL? 
>> IT TAKES ME AWAY FROM THE 
CONVERSATION WE HAD BEFORE. 
IF, IN FACT, WHAT THE SENATOR 
SAID IS CORRECT -- HE WAS 
SPECULATING. 
HE DIDN'T SAY IT WAS CONFIRMED, 
THAT IT HAPPENED IN THE 
NEWSROOM. 
LET'S JUST SAY IT DID. 
IF IT HAPPENED IN THE NEWSROOM, 
THAT'S GOING TO TELL US THAT 
PARTICULAR SHOOTER WANTED GRAND 
RECOGNITION. 
INITIALLY ONE MAY THINK IF IT 
HAPPENED IN THE NEWSROOM, IT 
MAY HAVE BEEN LIKE WE TALKED 
ABOUT IN 2015. 
IT MAY HAVE BEEN A DISGRUNTLED 
EMPLOYEE THAT CAME INTO THE 
NEWSROOM TO PERPETRATE SOME ACT 
OF VIOLENCE AS A FORM OF 
RETRIBUTION. 
>> THAT CASE OF THE SHOOTER WHO 
KILLED A REPORTER AND ANOTHER 
EMPLOYEE IN VIRGINIA. 
>> WHILE THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE 
OF BROADCASTING. 
>> YES. 
>> HE WAS SENDING A MESSAGE. 
REMEMBER HE WANTED EVERYONE TO 
KNOW WHO HE WAS. 
SO THAT WORKPLACE VIOLENCE 
OFFENDER COMING INTO THE 
NEWSROOM, IT'S UNLIKELY THEY 
WOULD DO ANYTHING TO SHIELD 
THEIR IDENTITY BECAUSE THAT 
DETRACTS FROM THEIR AGENDA WHY 
THEY WENT THERE IN THE FIRST 
PLACE. 
THAT'S THE REASON I DON'T SEE 
THAT BEING THEM. 
THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PIECE, 
THE KEY INFORMATION YOU 
REPORTED ON ABOUT HIM DAMAGING 
HIS FINGERTIPS, THAT DOESN'T 
FIT FOR THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
BARTER COMING -- BATTERER 
COMING TO THE WORKPLACE. 
IT JUST DOESN'T FIT. 
COULD IT BE AN INDIVIDUAL THAT 
HAD AN AXE TO GRIND WITH THIS 
PARTICULAR NEWS AGENCY ABOUT 
SOMETHING THEY REPORTED 
RECENTLY OR IN THE PAST THAT HE 
FELT SO COMPELLED THAT HE FELT 
THAT HE NEEDED TO MAKE A 
MESSAGE, SOMETHING THAT WAS 
OFFENSIVE TO HIM OR OFFENSIVE 
POSSIBLY TO HIS RELIGION OR HIS 
CULTURE OR A GROUP THAT HE'S 
AFFILIATED WITH. 
COULD THAT BE IT? 
IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE. 
COULD IT BE -- AND I THINK THAT 
WE'LL FIND -- COULD IT BE THAT 
HE'S AFFILIATED WITH SOME TYPE 
OF ORGANIZED GROUP? 
I BELIEVE THAT. 
I BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU 
LOOK SPECIFICALLY -- AND I'M 
NOT SAYING IT IS -- BUT WHEN 
YOU LOOK AT GANG VIOLENCE, IT'S 
NOT UNCOMMON WHERE GANG MEMBERS 
WILL DO EXACTLY WHAT THIS 
INDIVIDUAL DID TO PREVENT LAW 
ENFORCEMENT FROM IDENTIFYING 
THEM ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. 
SO THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE IT, 
BUT I TRULY BELIEVE WE'LL FIND 
THIS INDIVIDUAL WAS AFFILIATED 
WITH SOME TYPE OF ORGANIZED 
GROUP. 
IT JUST DOESN'T FIT WITH THE 
THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. 
>> IT IS A DARK DAY WHEN 
NEWSROOMS ARE UNDER ATTACK. 
I, OF COURSE, THINK OF CHARLIE 
HEBDO IN PARIS. 
>> EXACTLY. 
>> AND SO MANY COUNTRIES WHERE 
NEWSROOMS AND JOURNALISTS ARE 
UNDER ATTACK. 
WE WILL HOPEFULLY FIND MORE 
INFORMATION ON WHY THIS SUSPECT 
ENTERED THIS NEWSROOM AND 
OPENED FIRE. 
WE DO KNOW RIGHT NOW FIVE 
PEOPLE ARE DEAD. 
THREE ARE WOUNDED. 
PAUL, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THIS STORY 
WHEN WE RETURN AS WELL AS THE 
REST OF THE DAY'S NEWS. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
>>> DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD 
ROSENSTEIN AND CHRISTOPHER WRAY 
ARE ANSWERING TOUGH QUESTIONS 
ON THE HILL TODAY. 
THEY ARE TESTIFYING BEFORE THE 
HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ABOUT 
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT 
INTO THE FBI'S CONDUCT DURING 
THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
AND ALLEGATIONS OF WITHHOLDING 
INFORMATION. 
REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS HAVE 
SEIZED ON THE REPORT'S FINDINGS 
THERE WERE A SERIES OF FAILINGS 
WITHIN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
DURING ELECTION SEASON. 
BOTH VOWED SWIFT ACTION TO 
ADDRESS THE CONDUCT. 
>> THE INSPECTOR GENERAL 
CONDUCTED A THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION AND FOUND SOME 
FBI EMPLOYEES DEVIATED FROM 
IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES IN 2016 
AND 2017. 
EVERYONE KNEW ABOUT SOME OF 
THOSE DEPARTURES WHEN THEY 
OCCURRED SUCH AS DISCUSSING 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AND 
ENCROACHING ON PROSECUTORIAL 
DECISIONS. 
WE LEARNED ABOUT OTHERS THROUGH 
THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATION SUCH 
AS LEAKING TO THE NEWS MEDIA 
AND EXHIBITING POLITICAL BIAS. 
WE NEED TO CORRECT ERRORS, HOLD 
WRONGDOERS ACCOUNTABLE AND 
DETER FUTURE VIOLATIONS. 
>> ALTHOUGH THE IG REPORT DID 
NOT FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF 
POLITICAL BIAS OR IMPROPER 
CONSIDERATION ACTUALLY 
IMPACTING THE INVESTIGATION 
UNDER REVIEW, THAT REPORT DID 
IDENTIFY ERRORS OF JUDGMENT, 
VIOLATIONS OF OR DISREGARD FOR 
POLICY OR DECISIONS THAT 
CERTAINLY WERE NOT THE BEST 
CHOICES. 
I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE 
THE STEPS WE'RE TAKING TO 
ADDRESS THE REPORT'S 
RECOMMENDATIONS. 
FIRST WE'RE GOING  TO BE 
HOLDING EMPLOYEES ACCOUNTABLE 
FOR MISCONDUCT. 
WE'VE FILED A REPORT WITH THE 
OFFICE OF RESPONSIBILITY WHICH 
IS THE FBI'S INDEPENDENT 
DISCIPLINARY ARM AND ONCE THE 
NECESSARY PROCESS IS COMPLETE 
WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO HOLD 
PEOPLE STRICTLY ACCOUNTABLE. 
>> SEAN SULLIVAN IS A 
CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER FOR THE 
WASHINGTON POST AND JOINS US 
NOW FROM CAPITOL HILL. 
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ARE 
CLEARLY COMING AT THIS IG 
REPORT AND THE HEARINGS FROM 
DIFFERENT ANGLES. 
ONE DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKER CALLED 
TODAY'S HEARING AN 
INVESTIGATION OF AN 
INVESTIGATION OF AN 
INVESTIGATION. 
SAY THAT THREE TIMES FAST. 
BREAK THAT DOWN FOR US. 
WHY DID HE CHARACTERIZE IT LIKE 
THAT? 
>> Reporter:  IT'S INTERESTING 
WHEN WE SEE TODAY'S HEARING AND 
WE SEE THE QUESTIONS THAT 
ROSENSTEIN HAS GOTTEN FROM 
LAWMAKERS, HE'S GETTING A LOT 
OF HEAT FROM REPUBLICAN 
LAWMAKERS AND IT LOOKS LIKE 
THINGS GOT TENSE IN THIS 
HEARING AT
