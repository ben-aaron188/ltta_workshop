“When he comes up,
keep your hands on the wheel.”
We’ve seen police violence
against black people depicted
in films and TV shows
for years now.
Everything from
“Sweet Sweetback's
Baadasssss Song,” a film
from the 1970s directed by
Melvin Van Peebles.
You have “Do the Right Thing,”
Spike Lee’s very important
film of the 1980s.
And even a sitcom
like “Family Matters”
dealt with the subject
of police harassment.
“Is that why you made
him get out of his car?
Is that why you
forced him to lie down?
Is that why you cuffed him?”
I think the difference
that we’re seeing now
is that because of the
media attention and the fact
that now we’re able to
actually oftentimes see
these shootings and
killings in our social media
feeds as they’re happening,
as a filmmaker, you
have to consider
that the viewer might be
coming with that baggage
especially if your targeted
audience is people of color.
When a show or movie
does not take care
of its audience or
doesn’t consider
what the audience may feel
it becomes a huge problem.
And it could border on
exploitative or even sort of
wallowing in the suffering
that is happening on screen.
An example of a work
that does not carefully
consider the
audience’s reactions
to seeing these images
on screen is “Detroit.”
The focus on the suffering and
the way in which the camera
really zooms in on that,
even though it’s effective,
can also just feel very
uncomfortable and icky
to experience.
I think for those
artists who are wrestling
with the subject, especially
those who are black,
it’s important for
them not to dwell
on the suffering or
the horrific moments.
It’s also very
important to focus
on the recovery, the
aftermath, the emotional toll
that comes along after
the incident has happened.
And I think one of the
better examples of this
has been “Queen Sugar.” In
Season 2 of “Queen Sugar,”
one of the characters,
Micah, who’s in high school,
gets pulled over while
riding in a very
expensive new birthday
present from his parents.
“Let me see your registration —
now.”
It’s not until later in
the season when we learn
what happened to Micah.
And we don’t have
to see it to know
how harrowing it is for him,
and that’s what makes
it really powerful.
“He takes out his gun,
pushes me down
and he puts the
gun in my mouth.
And he pulled the trigger, Dad.”
Another trend that’s been very
interesting to see among film
and TV shows has been
narratives that explore
the idea of police violence,
but not in a very
explicit way.
The interaction doesn’t
lead to any grand moment
or any shocking moment.
Instead, it’s just a very
awkward moment
and a couple of shows
that have done that well
have been “Insecure”
and “The Chi.”
With “Insecure” there’s
a scene in Season 2 —
“You in a rush?”
“Uh, no, sir.”
“You must be, making your illegal U-turn.”
Watching Lawrence's
body language
and the way in which
he uncomfortably
chats with a police officer
is part of what makes it
so visceral and feel so
grounded and real.
“Uh, here you go.”
And in “The Chi” there is a
similar instance where Brandon
is stopped by two police officers,
one black and one white.
“What are you stopping me for?”
“Get over the car.”
The threat of police
violence is something
that probably even more
people can relate to
than the actual
actions of them.
So when you think
of these projects
that are selective
with what they show,
I think we’re looking at works
that are really interrogating
and going deep into the way
in which these experiences
can affect us on both
an emotional level
and a psychological level.
“When an officer tells you
to stop, you stop.”
“Yes, sir.”
