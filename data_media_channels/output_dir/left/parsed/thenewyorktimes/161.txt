“Seven billion people inhabit
planet Earth.”
When I saw this video,
I was reminded of a phrase
that Milan Kundera came up with
in ”The Unbearable
Lightness of Being,”
which is “totalitarian kitsch.”
This sort of
cartoony, idealized aesthetic
using very broad,
what you might
call corny, images.
And you see this in
the aesthetics of a lot
of authoritarian regimes.
Vladimir Putin
being photographed shirtless,
it’s a corny,
ridiculous image.
And yet these corny,
ridiculous images
are often powerful
in strongman regimes.
Looking at it objectively,
as a piece of film
and a video being
used in diplomacy,
it’s kind of hilarious.
There are so many cornball,
cliché images.
“ — to be the future — ”
But in political kitsch, often
corniness and cliché is the point.
Clichés are images that
everybody has seen before.
They're images that
everybody recognize
and therefore, they’re images
that you can count on
to have broad mass appeal,
even if it’s not
sophisticated appeal.
“Their story is well known,
but what will be
their sequel?”
One thing this video
tells us
is the
kind of arguments
that the Trump administration
is making
to the North Korean
government:
"Make this deal and
you will look good.
You’ll be the protagonist
of the world.
You will live like a lottery winner."
What I saw, when I look at
the trailer,
was the Trump administration
trying to speak
to Kim Jong-un
the way the administration
speaks to Donald Trump.
“Be part of that world.”
Donald Trump is, shall
we say, a visual learner.
He prefers to get
his briefing material
in the form of
pictures, videos,
images, graphics.
Preferably the
material references his name
as much as possible in
order to keep his interest.
One thing that’s a constant
in Donald Trump’s career
is his use of big,
broad cartoony symbols
to get across big, broad
cartoony messages.
“Bradford, you’re fired.”
How do you make yourself a
celebrity as a businessman?
How do you create
the idea that you’re
the most successful
businessman in the world,
whether you are or not?
Well, you build a giant skyscraper
with your name on it
in three-foot-tall, brass
golden letters.
And that’s what
made Donald Trump
so fitting for
reality TV.
Reality TV, likewise, communicates
in big broad symbols:
desert islands, roses.
There’s this
theme with him
of sort of seeing himself
as the protagonist of a show
that he and other
people are watching.
“It comes down to a choice.”
So this video is reaching
out a hand to Kim Jong-un
and saying, “Work with me. You
can be my co-star
in this show that everybody
else is watching."
“Will this leader choose
to advance his country
and be part of a new world?”
What you have in
this video
are a lot of garish
symbols of importance.
This montage at the
beginning, for example,
where a big image of
the North Korean flag
is equated with the
Colosseum and the pyramids.
It’s a way of communicating
that, “Work with us,
and you will be regarded as
one of the greats of history."
“ — or more isolation — ”
This seems like the
kind of kitschy picture
that in a weird way is fitting
for a regime like Kim’s.
It’s surreal but
it’s no more surreal
than the host of
“The Apprentice”
negotiating a nuclear deal
with the head of North Korea.
This is the world
we live in now.
“One moment.
One choice.”
