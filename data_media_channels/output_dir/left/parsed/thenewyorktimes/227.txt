What’s astonished me
about Donald Trump
is how effectively he’s
managed to take his opponents'
strengths and turn
them against them.
It’s a type of political
jujitsu that we saw back in 2004
when John Kerry was
being "Swift-boated."
John Kerry is no war hero.
I know John Kerry is lying
about his first Purple Heart.
-It was shocking at the time.
And what we’re seeing now is, is
that on steroids.
John McCain, he is a war hero.
He’s a war hero
’cause he was captured.
I like people that
weren’t captured, O.K.?
I hate to tell you.
The world
has turned upside down
if Donald Trump
is accusing people
like this of not
having integrity.
Whether it’s Jim Comey –
He’s a showboat.
He’s a grandstander.
– or Rod Rosenstein
These people have the biggest
conflicts of interest I’ve ever seen.
Or Robert Mueller, who
have spent their lives working
to uphold the rule of law,
he doesn’t care.
It’s not to say that
James Comey is a saint
or that Rod Rosenstein has never
made a mistake in his life.
It’s to say that I don’t
think anyone can dispute
that these men are people
who have devoted their lives
and their careers
to upholding the law.
And they are being
attacked on those grounds
by the least law abiding
president we’ve ever had.
Should Donald
Trump be impeached?
I hope not. Because I think
impeaching and removing
Donald Trump from office
would let the American people
off the hook.
There’s just no way,
short of Donald Trump
eating live babies
in the Oval Office,
There is no way he’s
going to be impeached.
There aren’t the
votes in Congress.
The American people are going to
have to deal with this problem
by showing up at the polls,
by expressing their values,
and by voting in people who
will uphold those values.
