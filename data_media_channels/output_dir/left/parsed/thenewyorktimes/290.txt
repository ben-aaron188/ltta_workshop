“We want change,
we want change ...”
“I don’t understand why
I could still go in a store
and buy a weapon of war.”
“There’s no better time than
now to talk about gun control.”
These are calls the
American public has heard before.
After Orlando —
“Democrats and Republicans
we spoke with agree,
suspected terrorists,
like the Orlando shooter,
should not be allowed
to purchase firearms.”
After Sandy Hook —
“90 percent of Americans support
universal background checks.”
After each mass
shooting, there’s
a surge of public support
for stricter gun control.
“A new poll from
Quinnipiac University
shows record high support
for stricter gun laws.”
So why hasn’t Washington put
stricter gun laws on the books?
There are several factors,
ranging from partisan divides
to gun owner activism to
the N.R.A.'s political clout.
No. 1: There’s
broad support, but also
big divisions on gun control.
The most comprehensive
data is from 2017,
and it shows that
60 percent of Americans
say they want
stricter gun laws.
Support is even higher for
things like
a 30-day waiting period for gun sales
and universal background checks.
But dig deeper, and you find
the devil is in the details —
and the divides.
Most Democratic voters
want stricter gun laws.
But less than 1 in 4
Republicans agree.
Most Americans who
don’t own firearms
say easy access to legal
guns fuels gun violence.
Fewer than half
of gun owners agree
Non-owners want to ban
assault-style weapons,
while most gun owners don’t.
“The person is the criminal,
not the weapon.”
Gun owners may be a
minority, but they’re
a very focused and
vocal minority.
Only about 3 in 10
Americans own a gun.
But to them, gun control is
not merely a policy issue —
it’s personal.
Nearly 40 percent say they always
have a loaded firearm
at the ready in their home.
74 percent say the
right to own a gun
is “essential” to their freedom.
Gun owners are much more
likely to contact lawmakers
about gun policy,
compared to non-owners,
and far more likely to donate
to gun advocacy and policy groups.
No. 3: The N.R.A. is a
formidable force in politics.
Less than 20 percent of gun
owners in America
say they belong to the N.R.A.,
but it’s big enough,
and disciplined enough,
to turn elections and to
end political careers.
Part of what makes the N.R.A.
so formidable
is the money it spends
helping friendly
politicians
and attacking those deemed enemies.
“Ross voted against your gun rights.”
The N.R.A.'s vast
marketing efforts
have helped turn gun
ownership into a badge
of cultural identity.
“It is not about politics.
It is a way of life.
I feel like we should be able
to express that.”
And their catchphrases
have become ubiquitous.
”You know, the guns don't kill people,"
people kill people.”
No. 4: The N.R.A.'s
leaders are more hard-line
than its members.
Polls show the N.R.A. members
do support some gun control policies,
like outlawing sales
to the mentally ill,
and people on terror watch lists.
Most also favor
universal background checks.
But time and time again,
N.R.A. leaders in Washington
work to kill these proposals.
After Sandy Hook,
N.R.A. leaders flipped the
script on mass shootings.
Instead of combating calls
for new gun control,
they actually demanded
more gun rights.
“The only thing that stops
a bad guy with a gun
is a good guy with a gun.”
And finally, no. 5.
Are Americans really clamoring
for more gun control?
Maybe not.
We see spikes and public
support for stricter laws
in the wake of mass shootings
like Columbine, Sandy Hook
and Las Vegas.
But in a matter of weeks,
the bumps fade.
In fact, overall Americans
have actually less supportive
of gun control over the past 25 years.
The shootings, meanwhile,
continue.
