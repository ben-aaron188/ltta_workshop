My husband was an
activist from El Salvador.
One time, he left on a
trip in about November
and I didn’t hear a word
from him until February.
Finally, he called and
asked me to meet him
in Mexico City the next day.
We had about one day
and one night together.
I knew that going
back to El Salvador
would be really dangerous.
I also knew that if he
couldn’t do the one thing that
was the most important
to him, that it would be
like he wasn’t really living.
A few weeks after I got home, 
I found out that I was pregnant.
A few weeks after
that, I found out
that Wilfredo had been killed.
I was just so glad that he
was leaving part of himself
with me.
I named him Daniel, a
pseudonym that his father used.
Having Danny in my life
was like having a light.
I was grieving and then I
had this beautiful baby.
I thought about, even
though Wilfredo isn’t here,
how can I raise Danny in a
way that would make him proud?
But on the other hand, 
I didn’t want Danny
to feel like he had to
replace his father in any way.
And so I wrote him a
letter and I promised him
that I was going to
let him be who he was
and allow him to
walk his own path.
That promise turned out
to be really important.
A few weeks before
Danny’s fourth birthday,
he told me that he wanted to
be a princess for Halloween.
This wasn’t really a
big surprise to me.
From the time he was
1 and 1/2 years old,
he had this Barbie that he took
with him everywhere he went
and he loved purple and pink.
I usually let him do
his thing at home,
but in public, I was worried
about judgment and teasing.
I didn’t know if I was doing
something wrong as Danny’s mom.
And I also kind of
wondered what Wilfredo
would have said or done.
I say to Danny, 
“How about Peter Pan instead?”
But Danny was really
clear on what he wanted.
I had to make a choice.
Would I try to pressure
him to be like other boys?
We found this big purple lacy
dress that had jewels on it
and I cut it down
to size for Danny
and I also found a
pink shimmery gown
because I decided I
could be a princess, too.
I had a dream that Wilfredo
came back to meet Danny.
I thought, oh no,
what if he sees
Danny in his princess dress?
And what if he doesn’t
accept him for who he is?
But I also believe in
something pretty fundamental.
Parents don’t get to decide
who their children are.
What we get to do
is to support them.
I do believe that
Wilfredo would have
seen that honoring Danny for
who he is was important to him.
Danny is really full
of love and heart —
something that he
got from his dad.
I would tell him, Danny
has not followed exactly
in your footsteps, but I can’t
imagine that you wouldn’t
be incredibly proud of our son.
He’s one of the bravest people
I’ve ever met, just like you.
My mother Nina —
I don't know a lot about her.
I remember that she was
profoundly sad.
It was sad being around sadness.
