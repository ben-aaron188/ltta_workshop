Ants are great tunnelers.
That’s how they make
their nests underground.
But even they run into traffic
jams, like this one here.
That’s not surprising.
But the solution is.
Experiments with fire ants
showed that the key to
avoiding jams and
solving ones that do
occur is idleness —
30 percent of the ants do
70 percent of the work.
And that turns
out to be ideal.
Add more ants to
the working pool,
and productivity suffers.
It’s not that any
particular ants are lazy,
or that they know how to
avoid jams completely.
Ants do pile up.
But they’re easily
discouraged by a jam
and good at backing
up and turning around,
allowing the remaining
workers to continue digging.
Some of the ants don’t
even go near the tunnel.
The researchers tested
their ideas
about optimal ant behavior
using robots
and magnetized spheres.
With simple instructions
to gather the spheres,
the robots all rushed to
work at the same time.
The result: gridlock.
But with some idleness
programmed in,
the robots were
more productive.
Here you can see the original
group versus ones programmed
to think more like ants.
In the real world, this
kind of programming
could make robot swarms
more effective
at searching disaster sites
or delivering drugs
inside the body.
So why don’t ants just
make wider tunnels
with more room for digging?
Well, here’s what happens
in a wider tunnel.
Sometimes, it’s hard
to hang onto the sides.
And sometimes, they
completely lose their grip.
How embarrassing.
