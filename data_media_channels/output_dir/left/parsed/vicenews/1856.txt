we're outside the village of petit which
is right next to the demarcation line
between Georgia and South Ossetia and
just yesterday two shepherds were
actually captured by troops from the
other side may have been Russian troops
actually who took them for allegedly
crossing the line South Ossetia is one
of two regions of Georgia that Russia
took over in a war in 2008 but this
summer Russia took things a step further
it posted fresh border markers and laid
claim to a mile-long section of a major
US backed BP operated oil pipeline so
now Russia has the capability to
sabotage its operation anytime it wants
to Moscow now controls about a quarter
of Georgia's total territory they arrest
anyone who strays across this new
defacto border Georgians are calling it
the creeping occupation the entire world
considers the land on both sides of this
fence to belong to Georgia only Russia
says that the land over here is part of
an independent country known as South
Ossetia
but the fence actually only goes up to
here and it ends which is why it's not
entirely clear for the local villages
hurting their sheep where they're
allowed to go and where they're not
supposed to be hi how are you
the wrathful et a shepherd agreed to
show us around the area his friends were

in South Ossetia alone
Russia's built 19 border bases like this
and one of them is a mere 40 miles from
Georgia's capital to Alesi we can see a
jeep moving inside the Russian base and
these guys say that usually when people
come up to the fence they come to check
out what's happening our guide was
getting nervous about being so close to
the fence so we headed down to the
village to meet the detained Shepherds

self-centered these detentions are a
huge issue for people along the new de
facto border line according to rebel
South Ossetia zone statistics more than
320 people have been detained so far for
what they call illegal crossings but
Russia's border creation policy is
causing other problems as well one of
the consequences of the so-called border
is Asian policy the creation of this new
border is that it doesn't always follow
the boundaries even of villages this
barbed-wire fence was put right in the
middle of a village called quality fact
it even goes through the yard of a
georgian man who's ended up on the other
side the last - it's here me neither

we now we reacted the defense's that was

creeping occupation the other side
caused it building the state border
infrastructure these things in people's
daily lives
can they visit their graveyard big
sometimes cannot do that we cost the
grave errors across then people cannot
get irrigation which they used the
previous years they cannot Bisset
relatives so it has direct impact on
their daily lives
in some parts is hundreds of families
affected these incidents we went and
investigated one of them that took place
yesterday to two shepherds were detained
what do you think is going to happen to
them usually people spent one or two
nights in detention they pay fine about
two thousand rubles and they released
within 48 hours 90% of cases but by now
the shepherds were missing for three
days we went to check with the family to
see if they'd heard any news are you
worried about what's gonna happen or do
you think that everything's going to be
okay that many employees do that what
the girl she was at all but I pick I got
taken in with her it's two thousand
rubles a lot of money for a typical

today to tell us what's been happening
here recently in front of us can see the
IDP camp another Buzzelli and left from

from the IDP camp you can see the Xhosa

meters now from highway and that's the
main IRA close to this buckos observe
the pipeline right this is the
southernmost point that the Russians and
the Isetta ins have claimed it's just a
couple hundred yards from the main
highway that goes through Georgia and
it's also south of the pipeline the Baku
soups a pipeline which was a major
us-backed project back in 1999 when the
560 million dollar Baku soups a pipeline
was inaugurated the u.s. hailed it as a
major breakthrough for the independence
of Georgia and oil-producing Azerbaijan
president Park Linton oyster Ostia not

accessibility was a livable for now
Russia has simply marked the area as its
own but if it were to disrupt the
pipeline or the highway
it'd be a catastrophe for Georgia
giorgia used to be a staunch US ally
they even named one of the streets of
their capital after george w bush but
after the war with russia in 2008 it
seems like their pro-western result may
be wavering they still go through the
motions of being in the western camp
they put hue flags on everything and
they send troops out on NATO missions
around the world but their response to
Russia's expanding territorial claims
inside Georgia it's been so weak that
some people think the current leadership
may have actually sold out to Russia
speaking of NATO the Alliance was about
to open a facility in Georgia so we went
there to meet top officials to ask them
what they were gonna do about Russia's
expanding border
all of the country's top political
leadership including the Prime Minister
the president as well as the defense
minister are here and they've invited
NATO's top commander the
secretary-general to attend to so NATO
is trying to show that it's still
committed to a relationship with Georgia
even though Russian troops are just
about a hundred kilometers away from
here

his son solution with Russian troops so
close Georgia's leader felt it was
important to say the training center
wasn't meant as a threat to them
is this a higher level of cooperation
that you have with Georgia now is it a
reaction to the recent measures that
Russia has been taking in South Ossetia
putting up border signs and taking over
a major infrastructure like oil pipeline
in the region this is something which is
planned and decided for those events
this is part of what we call the
comprehensive packaged they increase
cooperation between NATO and Georgia
even NATO's leader didn't want to anger
Russia
why have Georgian forces taken no action
against the recent territorial claims
that the Russian and South Ossetia
forces have been making near major
infrastructure of Georgia including the
pipeline and the highway Georgia is
taking every action there's possible
States responsible for the security of
its own country and responsible for not
allowing war on its territory we'll be
making these our diplomatic actions that
we are taking and this is actuation of
the world community for the cause of
Georgia and we're not gonna allow Russia
to provoke us into another world many of
those governments critics say that this
is a pro-russian policy that you have do
you agree with them to not counter
Russia I'm not responsible for every
craziness that I hear to answer any
questions there is no human being in
this country you will find and you can
go out in the street and ask my name who
will say what you've just said all of
the Georgian officials we spoke to seem
to be pushing the line that it was
dangerous to provoke Russia by reacting
to its latest moves but not everybody in
Georgia sees things that way we've come
to the National Movement headquarters
there the avowedly anti Russian party
which is now in opposition and you can
see what they think of the Russian
border posts do you consider the Defense
Minister to be pro-russian or anti
Western the fence Minister represents
the fracture of coalition who is
rhetorically the most Pro Western so
they play a fig lever role in that I
mean they opened up this NATO training
facility just the other way we welcomed
the new training facility after Russian
invasion in Ukraine and after there is
finally awakening to
put in challenge there were certain
steps made by the Alliance and generally
the west and one of its steps with
respect of Georgia was the center good
but not sufficient so what is your
criticism of their policy you cannot
have a concept that your goal is to say
we are just doing nothing and we're good
guys and our Western friends will tell
us well good you're not creating another
headache for us don't they have a point
when they say that Russia could crush
Georgia I mean when your government was
in power in 2008 Russia wiped the floor
with the Georgian army and just under a
week repeating every day day in and day
out Russia will crush you Russia will
pressure makes no point we all know that
this is a danger and Georgia will never
be able on its own to win a war against
Russian we don't want the war but what
we should do is this issue should be
higher on international agenda and this
is completely not now and secondly on
the ground there should be much more
reserved but the resistance by law
enforcement towards kidnappings towards
movement of occupation line
so what has George's go softly approach
towards Russia actually achieved I
invited the minister of reconciliation
to the borderlands to ask him his job is
to make the ethnic minorities living
under Russian control want to return to
Georgia

are South Ossetia and Russians picked up

did Russia build the new fences to keep
