that's another one an estimated 5,000
people leave Eritrea every month and
almost as many men women and children
left that country last year as fled
Syria it is a human exodus that is all
the more staggering when you consider
that this is a country of just six
million people and one that is not
presently at war Eritrea is officially
the world's most censored country
president Esaias F workman has ruled the
country since its independence from
neighboring Ethiopia more than 20 years
ago
access to information is limited just 1%
of the population have access to the
Internet and only 6% have a mobile phone
the law does not allow independent media
to operate and the government controls
all media outlets foreign access to the
country is heavily restricted with
independent footage being extremely rare
in June 2015 the UN published a
commission of inquiry on human rights in
Eritrea the Commission found that
systematic widespread and gross human
rights violations have been and are
being committed with impunity in Eritrea
all eretrians are conscripted into the
army for national service that can last
their lifetime a policy which
international organizations and
politicians have equated to slavery

2015 figures from the UNHCR report that
there are just under 400,000 Eritrean
refugees in East Africa a figure which
equates to around 6 percent of the
country's total population we traveled

investigate why such huge numbers are

critic of the government are considered
traitors in Eritrea with imprisonment
and disappearances common because of
this threat oppositional movements and
independent journalism are coordinated
outside of the country there's no
freedom of expression that's as brief as
it gets there are no independent
newspapers where we're saying that the
people inside the country are voiceless
we are their own Salaam Kodama is a
co-founder of the freedom Friday
movement a group that remotely
coordinates underground activists living
inside Eritrea
the Eritrean diaspora community are
using satellite technology and phones to
get information back into their homeland
I've had death threats I've had threats
of physical violence against me we're
not a political organization that have
got a specific political end per se we
are just we want the people to recognize
that they need they ought to have a
voice they're entitled to their voice
they're entitled to express it so what
we are faced with is a very limited way
of working so we're whereby you can text
message for instance a lot of people you
cannot do that in Eritrea or you cannot
use the internet because it's monitored
we use telephones as our primary form of
contact the robo calls as we call them
that's a one minute message but that
goes out to sometimes five thousand
three thousand or 10,000 people every
information could like a freedom fighter
the movement into trouble
this video shows activists writing
campaign messages on banknotes to
encourage people to stop fleeing the
country and stay and fight for freedom
here activists write graffiti and post
stickers in phone booths spreading word
of the freedom Friday movement in their
four years of trying freedom Friday have
managed to smuggle just 15 minutes of
footage outside of the country any
footage from inside the country that is
smuggled out is is newsworthy it's it's
it's a very rare thing we've got to
smuggle everything into the country and
then getting those pictures and that
footage out of the country
another very very big and very risky
operation there is only the
government-owned TV station so they've
they've been brought up in this
propaganda filled atmosphere where they
have never been people got a very
paranoid worldview so they did they're
not sure of themselves they don't know
who to trust and who not to trust we put
quite a lot of people at risk they could
get tortured masses and masses of people
have been taken to prison and questioned
specifically on working for freedom
Friday so these are people who are
risking their lives literally with no
independent press in Eritrea and all
journalists working for the Ministry of
Information in manually Yasu aims to
provide the country with an independent
source of information via satellite the

before I was the journalists become in
Eritrea the minister of information I
used to interview the president himself
Allah you have freedom here to do
whatever you want to do I mean but in
Eritrea that is censorship you have
there is a government line that you have
to follow you know I mean somehow
recently it became very popular people
are buying satellite this is in order to
access information and this shows you
probably the hunger they have for
information the geography limits you I
mean if you are going to bring about
real change in your own country but
fortunately we are lucky to have this
internet and we can communicate we can
connect with the people back home I
think I'm using my my the freedom I have
on the availability of the digital
processes you know to my people
this undercover footage was acquired by
another opposition radio station in
November 2015 after being smuggled
across the border although they are
unable to access the country Amnesty
International have used satellite
imagery to map the location of prisons
in Eritrea a dr beta is located just
outside the capital Asmara
the prison is where national service
deserters are those that have been
caught trying to cross the border ascent
without trial on his radio show emmanuel
an interview with the prison
interrogator who worked there and it's
easier for a refugee like me to get lost
in the new environment because you can
work and earn money you can do whatever
you want but it's the love of the people
that is encouraging me to do what I'm
doing you know I don't do the things
that I would like to do as a normal
person I don't give time to my family
you know they are missing out a lot
because I'm doing this work if I went
back to Eritrea I would be killed
because I'm an enemy of the state
they've called a lot of names like
traitor CIA agents or Ethiopian agents
things like that but you don't care that
much about it you know because we know
what we are doing and when it is a big
picture I am doing it for
out of the love of my people and country
you know
you
