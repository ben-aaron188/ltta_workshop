108
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,578

UBER IS IN PITTSBURGH SO SOON.

112

I'M REALLY IMPRESSED BY THAT,

113
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,428
THOUGH I'M NOT SURE IF I WOULD

114
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,830
WANT TO BE ONE OF THE PEOPLE TO

115
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:29,101
RIDE IN THEM.

116
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:29,936
UBER HAS PUT ALL THIS MONEY INTO

117
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:33,639
ITS PITTSBURGH LABS, WHERE THEY

118
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,407
HIRE THESE PEOPLE AWAY FROM

119
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,843
CARNEGIE MELLON.

120
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,311
IT FEELS TO ME THAT THEY MAY BE

121
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:39,779
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE OUTCOME OF

122
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,613
THAT AND THAT'S WHY THEY FELT

123
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:47,353
THEY HAD TO BUY AUTO.

124
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,087
IT LOOKS LIKE FROM THE WAY

125
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,523
THEY'RE DESCRIBING IT THAT AUTO

126
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:51,791
WILL BE THE CENTER OF GRAVITY OF

127
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,161
UBER'S SOME DRIVING EFFORTS,

128
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,062
WHICH MIGHT BE A NEGATIVE FOR

129
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:56,796
THOSE PEOPLE ALL THE WAY IN

130
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,766
PITTSBURGH.

131
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,368
MAYBE THEY ARE SALVAGING THEIR

132
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,169
SELF-RESPECT BY DEPLOYING CARS

133
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:03,703
IN THEIR HOMETOWN.

134
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:07,173
EMILY: YOU SPECIFICALLY RESEARCH

135
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:07,974
DECISION-MAKING BY HUMANS VERSUS

136
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,808
MACHINES.

137
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,778
I WE LETTING -- ARE WE READY TO

138
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:15,214
LET ROBOTS TAKE THE WHEEL?

139
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:15,982
OUR ROBOTS READY FOR THE

140
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:16,415
CHALLENGE?

141
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:20,086
>> THIS IS REALLY ALL ABOUT

142
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,988
ESTABLISHING TRUST.

143
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,357
I'VE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS

144
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,157
EXTENSIVELY, WHEN SHOULD WE

145
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:26,792
TRUST MACHINES WITH DECISIONS.

146
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:31,331
THIS IS A BOLD MOVE BY UBER.

147
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,064
THEY ARE GOING OUT OF THE

148
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:36,035
SIMULATION MODE AND PUTTING THIS

149
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:39,405
OUT THERE INTO THE REAL WORLD.

150
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,074
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO ESTABLISH

151
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:44,277
TRUST WITH CONSUMERS AND EVEN

152
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,446
MORE IMPORTANTLY, TRUST WITH

153
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,181
REGULATORS WHO REALLY NEED TO BE

154
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,485
CONVINCED THAT THIS THING WORKS

155
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,419
AND IT'S BETTER FOR SOCIETY AND

156
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:55,321
IT DOESN'T IMPOSE HUGE RISKS ON

157
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,590
INDIVIDUALS.

158
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,292
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO DO IT,

159
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,059
WHICH IS TO PUT IT OUT THERE.

160
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,194
THIS IS BRILLIANT BECAUSE IT

161
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:05,131
PUTS THEM IN A POSITION WHERE

162
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,933
THEY GATHER REALLY VALUABLE DATA

163
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:07,800
THAT OTHERS DON'T HAVE, SO IT

164
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,305
GIVES THEM THAT FIRST MOVER

165
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:13,172
ADVANTAGE OF GATHERING DATA FROM

166
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:13,940
VEHICLES OPERATING IN THE REAL

167
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,875
WORLD.

168
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,543
AND THAT'S DIFFERENT, AND THEY

169
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,711
NEED TO DO THAT TO ESTABLISH

170
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,880
TRUST, WHICH IS KEY FOR THESE

171
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,447
KINDS OF SYSTEMS.

172
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,316
EMILY: HOW WILL THIS WORK?

173
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:28,921
DO USERS OPT INTO WANTING TO BE

174
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:29,956
PICKED UP BY A SELF DRIVING CAR,

175
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:30,556
OR DOES ONE SHOW UP?

176
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,558
>> YOU OPT IN, AND USE THE

177
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,928
PLATFORM NORMALLY.

178
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,530
IT'S LIKE BEING CALLER NUMBER

179
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,799
100.

180
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:41,968
YOU GET AN ALERT SAYING, YOU

181
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:42,835
WILL BE IN A SELF DRIVING CAR.

182
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:46,939
HOPE YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

183
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:47,640
LUGGAGE, BECAUSE THE SELF

184
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,307
DRIVING CARS HAVE GIANT

185
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,143
COMPUTERS IN THE TRUNK.

186
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:50,776
THERE ARE PRACTICAL

187
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:51,778
CONSIDERATIONS AS WELL.

188
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,881
ONE THING THAT'S REALLY

189
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:59,452
INTERESTING ABOUT THIS UBER SELF

00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,753
DRIVING THING IS THE DATA ANGLE,

191
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,789
WHICH IS THAT UBER HAS DRIVEN

192
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:04,523
MANY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS, I

193
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:06,692
GUESS ILION'S OF -- BILLIONS OF 

194
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,861
MILES.

195
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:12,465
THEY ARE SAYING THEY MAY BE ABLE

196
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:13,332
TO USE THE DATA THEY'RE HUMAN

197
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,166
DRIVERS ARE COLLECTING TO TRAIN

198
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,068
THE ROBOTS, WHICH IS KIND OF AN

199
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:16,836
EXCITING THING FOR PEOPLE WHO

200
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:17,837
ARE DEEP IN THE SPACE.

201
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:23,009
>> THTA'S KEY -- THAT'S KEY.

202
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,044
IN THE WORLD WORLD, YOU GET EDGE

203
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:25,478
CASES.

204
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:30,116
OTHER PEOPLE REFER TO THEM AS

205
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:34,187
RUMSFELDIAN UNKNOWNS.

206
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,221
YOU HAVE TO HAVE THESE MACHINES

207
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,956
EXPERIENCE AS MUCH OF THAT AS

208
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,458
POSSIBLE, AND IT'S ONLY POSSIBLE

209
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,192
WHEN THEY DRIVE IN THE REAL

210
00:07:40,192 --> 00:07:41,294
WORLD.

211
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,228
THE OTHER THING THAT HASN'T BEEN

212
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,563
TALKED ABOUT, THIS IS UBER

213
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:45,531
GETTING BACK INTO CHINA, IN A

214
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:52,872
WAY, BECUASE -- BECAUSE VOLVO IS

215
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,007
REALLY OWNED BY KEELEY.

216
00:07:55,007 --> 00:08:00,513
EMILY: INTERESTING POINT, ON THE

217
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,380
BACK OF THEM SELLING THEIR CHINA

218
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,181
BUSINESS TO THEIR BIGGEST RATTLE

219
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:06,185
-- RIVAL IN CHINA.

220
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,020
WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND

221
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,754
ME WHO MAY NOT OPT INTO THIS

222
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,823
RIGHT AWAY WHO ARE ON THE ROAD

223
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,191
AND DID NOT CHOOSE TO BE DRIVING

224
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:13,326
NEXT TO A SELF DRIVING UBER

225
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:13,759
VOLVO?

226
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,298
>> THAT'S RELATED TO THE

227
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,266
QUESTION RUNNING THROUGH MY

228
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,067
HEAD, WHICH IS THAT THEY BETTER

229
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,369
HOPE NOTHING GOES WRONG HERE.

230
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,137
TESLA WAS CLAIMING THEY HAD MORE

231
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,672
DATA ABOUT SELF DRIVING BECAUSE

232
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,506
THEY HAVE ALL THESE CARS ON THE

233
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:29,175
ROAD.

234
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,378
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN TESLA

235
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:33,078
HAD ONE ACCIDENT THAT WAS

236
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:34,746
PROBABLY QUITE PREDICTABLE, BUT

237
00:08:34,746 --> 00:08:39,351
THESE OVERLY VALUED COMPANIES,

238
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,152
WHETHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE, THEY

239
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,986
ALMOST HAVE THIS EXTRAORDINARY

240
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:42,788
PRESSURE TO PROVE THEY CAN DO

241
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:43,322
THESE THINGS.

242
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:46,692
THAT MEANS THEY ARE IN A

243
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:52,431
PERILOUS POSITION IF THEY GO

244
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:52,832
WRONG.

245
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:53,666
FROM EVERYTHING I HEAR, THEY'RE

246
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,434
NOT GOING TO GET THOSE TWO

247
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:56,202
PEOPLE OUT OF THE FRONT SEAT

248
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:56,669
ANYTIME SOON.

249
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:57,336
IF THEY DID, THEY MIGHT BE

250
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:58,938
INVITING DISASTER.

ANGEL INVESTOR BEFORE THE

GRADE BLOOMBERG SAT DOWN WITH

267
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,572
HIM IN BERLIN AND ASKED WHAT HE

268
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:34,373
WAS THINKING WHEN HE BET ON THE

269
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:34,974
COMPANY WAY BACK THEN.

270
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,577
>> IT WAS NOT A HOT DEAL WHEN I

271
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,378
INVESTED IN IT.

272
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:45,684
RYAN GRAVES, THE FIRST EMPLOYEE,

273
00:09:45,684 --> 00:09:46,452
WAS MENTORING TECH STARTERS.

274
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,754
IT WASN'T HARD TO GET INTO.

275
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,456
IT WAS JUST AN IDEA, LIKE ANY

276
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,792
OTHER, BUT YOU ARE EXCITED BY

00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:53,559
THE PEOPLE AND THE VISION THEY

00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,764
OF THE OTHER INVESTMENTS I'VE

00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,832

335
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,179
THE CELLULAR CHIPS OF TODAY'S

336
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,982
AGE CONSUME TOO MUCH POWER FOR

AN APPLE WATCH, A SMALL SIZED

338
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:12,751
WATCH.

339
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,286
THE TRADE-OFF WAS TOO LARGE TO

340
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,988
HAVE THAT IN THERE BECAUSE THE

341
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:16,755
BATTERY WOULD DRAIN TOO QUICKLY

342
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:17,256

344
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,795
>> I THINK IT'S NOT SHOCKING.

345
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:23,595
ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE BEEN

346
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:25,831
LOOKING AT IS, WHAT IS THE MODEM

347
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:26,765
TECHNOLOGY GOING TO BE BEHIND

348
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,034
THIS RATE WE HAVE BEEN HEARING

349
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:29,835
APPLE IS WORKING ON THEIR OWN

350
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:30,870
MODEM TECHNOLOGY.

351
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,640
THE COMPUTER ON THE WATCH IS --

352
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,374
THEY WOULD NEED TO DESIGN A

353
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,943
MDOEM ONTO THAT -- MODEM ONTO

354
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:42,448
THAT.

355
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,215
I HAD BEEN HEARING THAT WAS

356
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:43,982
DELAYED FOR SOME OF THE REASONS

357
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:45,651
THAT MARK SAID, WE WERE NOT ON

358
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:49,889
THE SAME TRACK.

359
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,991
WE SEE WITH EXISTING WATCH

360
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:53,792
OWNERS, WE HAVE RESEARCH DATA

361
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:57,162
THAT SUGGESTS THAT THEY WANT

362
00:14:57,162 --> 00:14:57,729
THAT FEATURE.

363
00:14:57,729 --> 00:14:59,031
IT'S A REALLY QUESTION, LIKE

364
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,468
WHERE IS THE VALUE IN IT, IS IT

365
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:02,968
A NECESSITY.

366
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:03,769
GPS MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO BE

367
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,571
IN THE PRODUCT.

368
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,539
THE MODEM, I'M NOT SURE.

369
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,975
HE WOULD BE A NICE FEATURE, BUT

370
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:10,876
I'M NOT SURE THAT IS WHY SOMEONE

371
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:11,477
WOULD GO OUT AND BUY.

372
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,979
EMILY: WILL THE NEW WATCHES BE

373
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:14,713
UNVEILED AT THE SEPTEMBER 7

374
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:15,080
EVENT?

375
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,984

376
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:19,651
WATCH UNVEILED THIS FALL,

377
00:15:19,651 --> 00:15:20,285
WITHOUT THE CELLULAR.

378
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:22,888
EMILY: WHAT WILL BE NEW ABOUT

379
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:23,255
THEM?

380
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:27,393
>> NEW HEALTH TRACKING FEATURES.

381
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,227
PARTLY THAT WILL BE BECAUSE OF A

382
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,061
NEW GPS CHIP.

383
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:33,499
GPS RIGHT NOW IS IN THE IPHONE.

384
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,299
IF YOU WANT THE MOST ACCURATE

385
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:39,004
DATA FOR RUNNING AND WALKING,

386
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:39,872
YOU HAVE TO EITHER CALIBRATE FOR

387
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:40,706
A 20 MINUTE PROCESS OR BRING THE

388
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:41,206
PHONE WITH YOU.

389
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,543
NOW THE GPS WILL BE BUILT INTO

390
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,410
THE WATCH SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO

391
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,478
WORRY ABOUT THAT.

392
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:47,179
YOU CAN GET CONSISTENTLY

393
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:47,913
ACCURATE DATA WITH EVERY

394
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:48,280
WORKOUT.

395
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,350
EMILY: WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT HOW

396
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,487
THE WATCH IS ACTUALLY SELLING?

397
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:56,288
YOU'VE HAD MORE POSITIVE

398
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,390
ANALYSIS THAN SOME OTHERS.

399
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,124
HOW ARE WATCHES SELLING?

400
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:04,796
>> IT'S INTERESTING, BECAUSE

401
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:05,597
THEY ARE WAITING TO THE FALL TO

402
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,199
UPDATE THIS PRODUCT THAT HAS

403
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,233
BEEN ON THE MARKET FOR OVER A

404
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,802
YEAR, VERSUS IF THEY HAD DONE A

405
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:12,237
REFRESH IN THE SPRING WE WOULD

406
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,071
SEE MORE OPTIMISTIC SALES GOING

407
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:15,274
INTO THE MOMENTUM OF THIS YEAR.

408
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,577
IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THIS

409
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:19,244
CATEGORY IN GENERAL BUT

410
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,080
PARTICULARLY WATCHES, CLEARLY

411
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,715
IT'S A HOLIDAY PRODUCT.

412
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:24,416
IT MAKES SENSE TO DO THAT

413
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,751
REFRESH.

414
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:26,552
FOR ME, THIS IS ALL ABOUT CAN

415
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,288
THEY GROW SALES TO NEW

416
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:29,721
CUSTOMERS.

417
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:31,156
THERE'S A LOT OF TECHIES AND

418
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,524
EARLY ADOPTERS.

419
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:35,527
CAN THEY BRING IT TO NORMAL

420
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,629
PEOPLE?

421
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,064
WHAT PRICE POINTS DO THEY GET

422
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,599
TO?

423
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:44,603
DO THEY DO MUCH ON DESIGN?

424
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,805
THESE ARE THE THINGS STRAIGHT WE

425
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:47,573
STILL SEE MOST OF THIS BEING A

426
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:52,710
FITNESS AND HEALTH MARKET.

427
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,480
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT EXPANDED

428
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,615
IS SOME OTHER USE CASES.

429
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:57,516
THAT'S WHERE THE NEW SOFTWARE,

430
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,719
NEW DEVELOPERS MIGHT EXPAND IT.

431
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,653
WE STILL THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

432
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:05,022
HEADROOM IN THIS MARKET, AND

433
00:17:05,022 --> 00:17:05,757
THERE'S AN EVOLUTION FOR

434
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:06,959
WATCHES.

435
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,759
I DO THINK IT IS GOING SLOWER

436
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,063
THAN WE THOUGHT.

437
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:11,997
THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION, WHAT IS

438
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,665
THE SIZE OF THE MARKET.

439
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,233
EMILY: DAVID?

440
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:20,705
>> I ALWAYS THOUGHT APPLE

441
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:21,607
OVERPLAY THE FASHION PART OF THE

442
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,174
WATCH.

443
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,075
ONE OF THE REASONS THERE ISN'T

444
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:27,079
THAT MUCH DEMAND FROM NON-TECH

445
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,947
IES IS THAT THEY HAVEN'T

446
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:34,019
EXPLAINED IT VERY WELL.

447
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,188
I WENT TO THE DINNER LAST NIGHT

448
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,056
I WAS HOSTING, VERY BUSY.

449
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:41,093
SOMEBODY WAS UNHAPPY SOMEWHERE

450
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,694
IN THE ROOM AND I GOT A TEXT

451
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:43,996
MESSAGE ON MY WATCH AND IT

452
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:44,796
REALLY HELPED ME DO MY JOB IN A

453
00:17:44,796 --> 00:17:46,965
WAY I COULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE.

454
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:51,503
I THINK ISRAEL BENEFITS TO THE

455
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,840
WATCH -- THERE'S REAL BENEFITS

456
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,241
TO THE WATCH THAT ARE NOT

457
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,343
UNDERSTOOD.

458
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:00,045
IT SEEMS TO ME MORE THAN IT WAS

459
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:04,083
WORTH OF TO THAT POINT.

460
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:08,053
ABOUT THE BATTERY, THIS IS THE

461
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:08,954
THING THAT'S HOLDING BACK THIS

462
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,156
ENTIRE INDUSTRY, WHEN OF THE

463
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:12,024
REASONS IT'S A PROBLEM WITH THE

464
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:14,226
WATCH.

465
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,061
IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE A FAIRLY

466
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:16,528
BIG SCREEN.

467
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,263
THERE ARE WATCHES OUT THERE THAT

468
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,064
CONNECT TO CELL PHONE NETWORKS

469
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,133
PERFECTLY FINE.

470
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:23,902
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE AS MANY

471
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:24,369
FEATURES.

472
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,104
IT'S APPLE'S DESIRE TO HAVE IT

473
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:27,506
ALL AT A TIME WHEN BATTERY

474
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:28,373
TECHNOLOGY IS NOT MOVING FORWARD

475
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,174
QUICKLY ENOUGH.

476
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:34,813
IT'S THE ONE THING I KEEP

477
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:35,580
FINDING DISAPPOINTING ABOUT

478
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,315

BE, IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE

DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS IN BATTERY

482

483
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:44,222
THAT PEOPLE REALLY WANT.

484

EMILY: BATTERY TECHNOLOGY HAS

485
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:48,327
NOT IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN A

00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:48,694
CENTURY.

487
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,263

THE BATTERY LIFE, TO HELP YOU

492
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,339
MANAGE THE BATTERY, THAT I THINK

493
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,039
WILL GIVE SOME PHONES AND

494
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,374
ADVANTAGE.

495
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:03,975

00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:04,682
VERY DIFFERENT, AND B, CHINA

752
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:06,083
WILL BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF ITS

753
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:06,417
DNA.

754
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,218
WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO BUILD A

755
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,086
COMPANY THAT TRIED TO PUSH ITS

756
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:11,822
PRODUCT INTO CHINA, WE INSTEAD

757
00:33:11,822 --> 00:33:13,958
ARE GOING TO HAVE IT AS SORT OF

758
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:18,329
A BRIDGE WHERE IT IS LITERALLY

759
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:18,863
PART OF THE DNA.

760
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:21,432
EMILY: HOW ARE YOU DOING THINGS

761
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:22,333
DIFFERENTLY FROM TRADITIONAL

762
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:22,767
STUDIOS?

763
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:27,338
>> THE MAIN THING IS TO DO WITH

764
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,441
THE PRODUCT MIX.

765
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,210
THE SIX MAJOR STUDIOS HAVE

766
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:36,314
CHANGED THEIR FILMS TO BEING

767
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,282
FEWER BUT MORE EXPENSIVE,

768
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:39,016
CLASSIC SEQUELS, REMAKES AND

769
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:41,986
FRANCHISE FILMS, WHICH IS

770
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:43,788
EXACTLY WHAT THEY SHOULD BE

771
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:44,222
DOING.

772
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:44,989
THEY CREATED THIS INTERESTING

773
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:45,690
VACUUM IN THE MIDDLE, $20

774
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:50,494
MILLION TO $80 MILLION PRICE

775
00:33:50,494 --> 00:33:51,329
RANGE WHERE YOU HAVE A STAR IN A

776
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:51,829
SIGNATURE ROLE.

777
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:52,597
WE KNOW THAT TO BE A PROFITABLE

778
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:53,231
AREA.

779
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:56,367
GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE WEREN'T

780
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,169
BURDENED WITH LEGACY DEALS OR

781
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:58,936
MASSIVE OVERHEAD, WE WERE ABLE

782
00:33:58,936 --> 00:33:59,604
TO GO AFTER THAT SPACE.

783
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:04,542
"BAD MOMS" IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT

784
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,276
WE HOPE TO DO OVER AND OVER

785
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:05,610
AGAIN.

786
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,846
EMILY: IS "BAD MOMS" A GOOD

787
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:09,614
EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING YOU ARE

788
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:10,214
DOING DIFFERENTLY?

789
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,516
IF NOT, WHAT ARE THE MOVIES THAT

790
00:34:13,516 --> 00:34:14,217
EXEMPLIFY THIS STRATEGY?

791
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:17,255
>> "BAD MOMS" IS EXACTLY WHAT WE

792
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,156
ARE TRYING TO DO, A $20 MILLION

793
00:34:19,156 --> 00:34:22,059
FILM THAT SHOULD DO $200 MILLION

794
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:25,730
BOX OFFICE WORLDWIDE.

795
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,630
IT'S A NUMBER OF IDENTIFIABLE

796
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,766
COMEDIANS IN A COMEDY.

797
00:34:29,766 --> 00:34:30,568
IT IS THESE ACTRESSES THE WAY

798
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:36,072
YOU WANT TO SEE THEM.

799
00:34:36,072 --> 00:34:36,907
AS A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT

800
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:39,043
OFFSHOOTS, TV AND SHORT FORM WE

801
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:41,379
CAN DO.

802
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:44,482
>> THE OTHER THING I WOULD ADD

803
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:48,819
TO THAT, WHICH ISN'T NECESSARILY

804
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:49,620
IS OBVIOUS WHEN YOU SEE A MOVIE

805
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,556
LIKE "BAD MOMS," WE BUILT THIS

806
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:53,357
COMPANY FROM THE BEGINNING WITH

807
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,190
AN EYE TO CHINA.

808
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:57,495
CHINA WILL WITHIN FOUR YEARS BE

809
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:58,663
THE LARGEST MEDIA MARKET IN THE

810
00:34:58,663 --> 00:34:59,063
WORLD.

811
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:05,703
WE BROUGHT IN THIS -- SOME OF

812
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:06,404
THE MOST IMPORTANT CHINESE

813
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,940
PARTNERS.

814
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,674
FROM THE BEGINNING WE HAD

815
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,576
CHINESE PARTNERS WE BROUGHT IN.

816
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:14,211
THE NOTION WAS TO BUILD CONTENT

817
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:15,680
THAT WAS LEVERAGED MORE GLOBALLY

818
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,914
FROM THE OUTSET WITH PARTNERS

819
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:17,715
THAT COULD HELP INFORM ON THE

820
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:19,684
CHINA SIDE, WHEN THEY WERE

821
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:20,484
LOOKING FOR IN MEDIA AS WELL.

822
00:35:20,484 --> 00:35:21,519
EMILY: THE ENTERTAINMENT

823
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,287
OPPORTUNITY IN CHINA AS WELL IS

824
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:26,691
CLEAR.

825
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,859
THERE ARE A LOT OF CHALLENGES,

826
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:29,927
AND DEALING WITH THE CHINESE

827
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:30,695
GOVERNMENT AND THE THINGS THEY

828
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:31,762
WANT THEIR PEOPLE TO SEE.

829
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:36,567
HOW DO YOU NAVIGATE THAT BALANCE

830
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:37,368
BETWEEN MAKING COMPROMISES TO

831
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:38,135
GET YOUR STUFF INTO CHINA AND

832
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:38,736
BEING TRUE TO THE ART?

833
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:43,674
>> THE KINDS OF CONTENT WE ARE

834
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:46,077
MAKING, WHETHER MOVIES, TV, IT'S

835
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:47,979
DESIGNED FOR GLOBAL AUDIENCE.

836
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:48,913
IT'S NOT DESIGNED EXPLICITLY FOR

837
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,715
CHINA.

838
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,550
WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE MOVIES FOR

839
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,784
THE WHOLE WORLD.

840
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:54,552
AS FOR BEING ABLE TO CRACK THE

841
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:57,989
CHINESE MARKET, AS BILL SAID,

842
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:58,956
TPG GROWTH INCUBATED THIS

843
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,925
COMPANY.

844
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:04,562
IT WAS LITERALLY JUST AN IDEA

845
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:05,363
THAT TWO YEARS LATER WE WILLED

846
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,798
INTO BEING, BUT ONE OF THE FIRST

847
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:12,904
PEOPLE WE WENT TO WAS ONE OF

848
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:13,738
CHINA'S LARGEST PE SHOPS.

849
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,741
HE'S BEEN A SPECTACULAR PARTNER

850
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:17,575
IN HELPING TO TEST AND NAVIGATE

851
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,912
HOW THINGS SHOULD WORK THERE.

852
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:24,248
TPG IS ALSO REALLY SUCCESSFUL,

853
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:25,049
ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL

854
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:26,050
PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS IN CHINA.

855
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,586
THIS IS WHERE COMPANIES LIKE 10

856
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:34,591
SENT COME IN.

857
00:36:34,591 --> 00:36:35,393
WHILE WE HAVE TRIED TO DO IS

858
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,795
ALIGN OURSELVES WITH THE BEST

859
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:43,067
THINKERS WHO CAN -- UNLIKE A

860
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:43,868
NORMAL AMERICAN COMPANY THAT IS

861
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:48,305
TRYING TO RETROACTIVELY PUSH

862
00:36:48,305 --> 00:36:49,240
THEIR STUFF IN, WE PROACTIVELY

863
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,141
TRY TO ALIGN OURSELVES WITH

864
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:53,411
PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND THE

865
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:54,178
MARKET, AND THAT'S WHAT

866
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:54,879
HOPEFULLY GIVES US AN EDGE.

867
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,182
EMILY: A LOT OF THIS NEW FUNDING

868
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:01,152
WILL BE USED TOWARDS NEW TV

869
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:01,585
PROJECTS.

870
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:02,353
WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES YOU

871
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,454
SEE IN TV WHEN HE HAVE AMAZON,

872
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:04,255
NETFLIX SPENDING SO MUCH ON

873
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:06,424
ORIGINAL CONTENT?

874
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,291
YOU HAVE PEOPLE SAYING, WE ARE

875
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:11,162
IN A TV BUBBLE.

876
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,731
WE ARE BALLOONING INTO

877
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,532
OVERSUPPLY AND THAT BALLOON WILL

878
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:16,500
EVENTUALLY DEFLATE.

879
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,602
I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THERE IS

880
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:18,436
GREATER SUPPLY OF TV THAN CAN BE

881
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:19,069
PRODUCED PROFITABLY.

882
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:24,442
>> JUST LIKE THE MOVIE BUSINESS,

883
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:25,409
THERE'S TELEVISION CONTENT THAT

884
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,210
WOULD NOT BE PROFITABLE AND IF

885
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,011
YOU PRODUCE THE RIGHT TELEVISION

886
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,212
CONTENT, IT CAN BE WILDLY

887
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:29,180
PROFITABLE.

888
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:35,319
HULU, AMAZON, NETFLIX ARE DOING

889
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,288
THE DOUBLING IN INVESTMENT

890
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,189
THEY'VE MADE BETWEEN LAST YEAR

891
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,423
AND THIS YEAR IN ORIGINAL

892
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,257
CONTENT SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT

893
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:41,259
THE WAY WE CONSUME TV IS

894
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,994
DIFFERENT RIGHT WHEN WE GREW UP,

895
00:37:43,994 --> 00:37:45,529
IT WAS A LINEAR BROADCASTING

896
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:45,963
MODALITY.

897
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,431
THE ONLY THING LEFT THAT IS

898
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,334
LINEAR IS SPORTS.

899
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,069
PEOPLE WILL SIGN ON TO THEIR

900
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:54,005
TELEVISION TO WATCH A SPORTING

901
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:54,805
EVENT, BUT THE REST OF CONTENT

902
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:55,606
TELEVISION IS A DIFFERENT FORM

903
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:58,342
OF MEDIA, AND THE LINES HAVE

904
00:37:58,342 --> 00:37:58,909
REALLY BLURRED.

905
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,045
YOU SEE A LIST ARTISTS DOING AN

906
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,746
INDIVIDUAL EPISODE OF "GAME TO

907
00:38:02,746 --> 00:38:04,849
THRONES".

908
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:08,352
THE QUALITY OF IT IS LIKE THAT

909
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,389
OF A MOVIE.

910
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:14,058
YOU NO LONGER HAD THE TELEVISION

911
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:14,859
COMEDY RUNT OF THE LITTER WITH

912
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:15,626
HOLLYWOOD LOT BUSTERS BEING THE

913
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:20,564
HIGH QUALITY -- BLCOKBUSTERS

914
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:21,632
BEING THE HIGH QUALITY --

915
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,668
BLOCKBUSTERS BEING THE HIGH

916
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:26,537
QUALITY.

917
00:38:26,537 --> 00:38:30,274
CHINA AND INDIA AND OTHER

918
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:31,509
EMERGING MARKETS HAVING SHOWN UP

919
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,209
MAKES FOR A FASCINATING

920
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:33,310
LANDSCAPE TO INVEST.

921
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:37,982
IT STILL HAS TO BE GOOD CONTENT.

922
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:38,782
IF YOU THROW LOUSY PRODUCTION

923
00:38:38,782 --> 00:38:39,617
OUT THERE, IT WON'T SUCCEED.

924
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:40,584
EMILY: WHAT KIND OF TV DO YOU

925
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:41,485
WANT TO DO?

926
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:45,556
>> IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

927
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:49,426
WHAT IS TV, IS WHAT WE ARE

928
00:38:49,426 --> 00:38:50,661
GRAPPLING WITH.

929
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,229
IT USED TO BE MOVIES WERE 90

930
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:53,898
MINUTES, IF YOU'RE TELLING A

931
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:54,765
STORY IT'S 90 MINUTES AND IT

932
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:55,499
WILL PROBABLY BE A MOVIE.

933
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,969
IF IT'S 22 MINUTES, IT WILL

934
00:38:58,969 --> 00:38:59,503
PROBABLY BE TV.

935
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,604
NOW IT'S 2 MINUTES ON FACEBOOK

936
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:05,609
OR 6 SECONDS ON SNAPCHAT.

BIGGEST MOVIE STAR BRANDS WHO

00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,034
ALL THESE LINES ARE COMPLETELY

951
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,035
BLURRING.

LOT MORE OVERLAPPING AND A LOT

IT'S BEEN A GREAT MARRIAGE FROM

MOST INTERESTING VR BUSINESSES

1038
00:44:58,395 --> 00:44:59,329
AND IT'S BASED ON A LOT OF WORK

1039
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:01,932
THAT WE'VE DONE THEMATICALLY TO

1040
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,600
UNDERSTAND HOW CONSUMERS ARE

1041
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,334
ENGAGING WITH MEDIA, AND WE

1042
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:08,105
BELIEVE IN SPORTS, MUSIC, AND

MEDIA CONTENT, GENERALLY GAMING

1044
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:13,477
VR WILL BE A UBIQUITOUS WAY WE

ALL ENGAGE.

00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:14,711
IT'S A MEANINGFULLY BETTER

EMILY: WHEN WILL I BE ABLE TO

1049
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,150
ENJOY A VR TV OR MOVIE

1050
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:21,151
EXPERIENCE COMFORTABLY?

1051
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,120
>> BASICALLY STARTING ABOUT NOW.

1052
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,590
AT STX, WE ARE NOT TECHNOLOGY

1053
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:27,624
PEOPLE.

1054
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:29,092
WE DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOING TO

1055
00:45:29,092 --> 00:45:29,493
WIN.

1056
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:32,362
OUR GOAL IS TO AGGREGATE THE

1057
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:36,566
BEST STORYTELLERS, TO FIGURE OUT

1058
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:37,367
WHAT THE SYNTAX IS GOING TO BE

1059
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:37,868
IN THIS SPACE.

1060
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:41,171
WITH VR, AND VR WILL BE HUGE,

1061
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:44,641
YOU DON'T CONTROL THE FRAME.

1062
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:46,276
IT'S TOUGH TO TELL THE STORY AND

1063
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:47,511
TAKE SOMEONE ON AN EMOTIONAL

1064
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:49,513
JOURNEY WHEN YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY

1065
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:50,881
MANIPULATE THAT STORY FOR THEM.

1066
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:51,748
IT WILL BE DIFFERENT LANGUAGE TO

1067
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:52,516
STORYTELLING.

1068
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:56,653
AND, WE ARE TRYING TO THROW SOME

1069
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:59,823
OF THE BEST MINDS AT THAT.

1070
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:00,624
THE BIGGEST STARS, THE BEST

1071
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:03,527
DIRECTORS ARE FASCINATED.

1072
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:07,698
FROM OUR STANDPOINT, WE FIGURE

1073
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:08,632
AS THE DIFFERENT COMPANIES ARE

1074
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:11,702
VYING FOR DOMINANCE, THEY WILL

1075
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:15,005
ALL NEED CONTENT, AND COMPELLING

1076
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:15,839
CONTENT, AND WE WANT TO BE THE

1077
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,741
ONE TO PROVIDE THAT VERY --

1078
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:18,141
THAT.

1079
00:46:18,141 --> 00:46:22,746
>> THE OTHER SIDE OF IT WILL BE

1080
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:25,883
EXPERIENCING LIVE EVENTS

1081
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:28,018
DIFFERENTLY.

1082
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:28,885
YOU ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO

1083
00:46:28,885 --> 00:46:32,656
HAVE THIS AND WHAT PEOPLE SPEND

1084
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:33,457
TO SIT IN THE FLOOR SEATS OF THE

1085
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,760
WARRIOR FINAL NBA GAMES.

1086
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,962
YOU WILL HAVE AN EXPERIENCE THAT

1087
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:39,730
IS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL, IF NOT

1088
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:40,530
BETTER THAN HAVING THOSE SEATS.

1089
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:44,001
EMILY: DO YOU THINK THERE IS

1090
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:44,701
ROOM IN THE FUTURE FOR THE

1091
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:45,302
HUMBLE MOVIE THEATER?

1092
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,738
WILL WE SILL GO -- STILL GO TO

1093
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:49,339
THE CINEMA?

1094
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:52,743
>> PERSONALLY, YES.

1095
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:55,078
I THINK THE MOVIE THEATER ISN'T

1096
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:56,079
GOING TO GO ANYWHERE.

1097
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:56,847
GOING BACK TO THE CAVE MEN

1098
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,816
SITTING AROUND TIRES TELLING

1099
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,919
STORIES, YOU WANT THAT COMMUNAL

1100
00:47:01,919 --> 00:47:05,022
EXPERIENCE.

1101
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,290
SITTING IN A DARK ROOM WITH A

1102
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:07,057
BUNCH OF PEOPLE LAUGHING OR

1103
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:07,691
BEING SCARED OR BEING

1104
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:12,095
INTERNALIZED, -- ADRENALIZED,

1105
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:12,963
THAT IS AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE OF

1106
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,965
WON'T GO ANYWHERE.

1107
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:15,766
THERE WILL BE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

1108
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:16,566
STORIES YOU TELL TO ACHIEVE THAT

1109
00:47:16,566 --> 00:47:18,101
GOAL.

1110
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:19,736
BEING ABLE TO WATCH SOMETHING ON

1111
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:23,006
TV IN YOUR OWN LIVING ROOM OR

1112
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:27,377
EVEN ON A MOBILE PHONE, I MEAN,

1113
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:28,912
IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT

1114
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:29,746
DEMOGRAPHICALLY AND CULTURALLY,

1115
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:30,347
PEOPLE ACCESS STORIES

1116
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:30,814
DIFFERENTLY.

1117
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:32,883
IN CHINA, IT'S ACTUALLY VERY

1118
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:33,617
NORMAL TO WATCH A 90 MINUTE

1119
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:37,120
MOVIE ON YOUR PHONE.

1120
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,957
THAT'S NOT NORMAL FOR US YET.

1121
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:43,393
