1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,140
If you zoom in to Morocco, you'll see a
tiny wedge of land that stands out from

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,500
its surroundings. This little bit of land
is surrounded by one of the most

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,540
fortified borders on the planet.

4
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,860
Right outside the border you'll find makeshift

5
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,580
forest camps, where people spend their
days and nights evading the police and

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,410
preparing to rush the border, usually in
large groups, with hopes of jumping over

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,700
and stepping foot on this land.

8
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,640
This peculiar scene plays out because
this piece of land, while in the

9
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,840
continent of Africa, is actually a piece
of Europe.

10
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,680
This small piece of land is called Melilla.
It's one of two Spanish enclaves in

11
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,820
Morocco, marking the only borders that
Europe shares with the continent of Africa.

12
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,580
Spain conquered Melilla in the late
1400s as part of its rapid global expansion.

13
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,140
This region of northern Africa
changed hands many times over the

14
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,140
following decades, but Spain kept hold of
Melilla.

15
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,580
Even in 1956, when the colonial

16
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:43,180
period was winding down and great powers
were ceding their colonies, Morocco had just

17
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,060
declared independence, but even then
Spain held onto its enclave.

18
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,600
Today, around 86,000 people live in Melilla
and when you're there you might as well

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,350
be in mainland Spain. The city is
designed with the distinctive Spanish

20
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,700
architectural style and residents speak
Spanish. They pay in Euros.

21
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,680
You're only reminded that you're not in mainland
Europe when you walk to the peripheries

22
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,699
of this city, to find one of the most
fortified border walls on the planet.

23
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,880
A seven mile barrier with layers of
protection

24
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,440
The first layer is a 20-foot metal fence,
followed by a second fence with a

25
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,950
flexible top, which makes it harder to
climb. Below this second fence you have

26
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,240
barbed wire netting, strong and dense
webs, then comes another taller fence

27
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,680
with a flexible top section and more
barbed wire. Then you're on the Moroccan

28
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,760
side where, you have a 6.5
foot ditch and then a double fence with

29
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,140
you guessed it, more barbed wire. There
are lookout posts and every inch of the

30
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,900
border is monitored by video
surveillance.

31
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,070
To understand why this

32
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,180
barrier exists, you have to cross over
into the Moroccan town of Nador and

33
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,550
then into the forest in the hills
surrounding the enclave.

34
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,460
These migrants are mostly from
sub-Saharan Africa and they all have

35
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,620
different motives for leaving their
homelands.

36
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,020
They gather in these camps and

37
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,820
plan for the day when they'll try to
cross into Melilla.

38
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,440
In response to this intense security, the migrants have

39
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,940
developed a technique that relies on
overpowering the border guards with

40
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,320
strength of numbers.

41
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,900
The groups range in
size, but are nearly always in the

42
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,490
hundreds. Most get caught right away on
the Moroccan side where they face border

43
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,390
agents who are not shy about using force.
Those who make it past the first few

44
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,780
layers, onto the Spanish section of the
barrier are also thrown back immediately

45
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,160
or detained, but because of their large
numbers a few will inevitably slip past

46
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,700
the guards. As soon as they put their
feet on the ground in Melilla, they are

47
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,480
technically in Europe and are guaranteed
certain protections under European Union law.

48
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,350
But they still have to run a hundred
meters to an immigration center, where

49
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,460
they can be taken in and given
protection from immediate deportation.

50
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,520
Arrivals to these enclaves came to a
head in 2014, when Spain decided it was

51
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,180
finally time to double down on its
effort to fortify this border. This was

52
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,810
mainly in response to the influx of
migrants attempting to get into Europe,

53
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,960
fleeing from conflicts in Africa and the
Middle East.

54
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,960
"Biggest wave refugees in modern history"

55
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,340
"hundreds of thousands of refugees"

56
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,949
"fleeing brutal violence in the Middle
East"

57
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:50,920
"cross over European borders by the
hundreds of thousands"

58
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,100
"in overcrowded boats, many drowning along the way"

59
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,520
Spain's response to this migration

60
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:01,120
crisis was to focus on the borders of
its enclaves in Africa, redoubling the

61
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,050
efforts to keep migrants out of this
little slice of Europe. The year after

62
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:11,560
the 2014 migration crisis, attempts to
jump the fence dropped by 67%.

63
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,860
Spain didn't make these numbers drop on their
own. One of the things you'll notice when

64
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,669
you look at this wall, is that Moroccan
military and police are also guarding

65
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:22,659
this border. The year of the migration
crisis, Morocco built these two extra

66
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:24,460
layers of barbed wire fencing.

67
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,520
"But authorities say dense new anticlimb mesh

68
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,660
stopped the latest to make the attempt
in their tracks"

69
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,349
So why would Morocco

70
00:05:32,349 --> 00:05:37,560
take the responsibility of building a
barrier and standing guard at Spain's border?

71
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,080
Turns out they have real
incentives to do so. Morocco has what's

72
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,680
called advanced status partnership with
Europe, which gives them economic and

73
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,550
political advantages in trade and
political affairs. The European Union

74
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,300
accounts for more than half of Morocco's
international trade and the EU also

75
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,529
provides Morocco with billions of Euros
in aid for security and development, so

76
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:59,620
the Moroccans in an effort to stay on
good terms with their northern neighbor,

77
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:05,080
take on the job of protecting Spain's
border. And they take their job very seriously.

78
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,060
Migrants had always had their forest camps right here,
right outside the city on this hill.

79
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,820
This was their camp for years and this
is the place where they used to regroup

80
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,020
and prepare a jump, until just a few
months ago when the Moroccan military

81
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,520
set up an outpost up here.

82
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,120
Now the migrants can't return and they have gone

83
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:01,380
to find another refuge, which is on a
hill 12 kilometers from here. Moroccan authorities

84
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,020
have started routinely raiding the camps.

85
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,500
But they don't deport them from
Morocco, they have other less

86
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,980
resource-intensive ways of keeping these
migrants from coordinating a large

87
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,730
enough group for a jump. The police were
here for three hours this morning, they

88
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:25,170
basically came in and stole a bunch of
stuff, they kind of disrupted these tents

89
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:31,410
and messed with these people's houses.
They harassed the women in violent ways.

90
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:35,370
They basically came here just to flex
their muscles and say you know we're in

91
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,960
charge, make sure you remember that.

92
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,160
About once a month the Moroccan authorities

93
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,520
round up the migrants and send them to
other parts of Morocco that are far away

94
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,760
from Melillah, preventing them from
gathering in a sufficient group to blitz the fence.

95
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,860
The Moroccan authorities are not concerned with keeping these

96
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,000
migrants out of Morocco, they're trying
to keep them from getting to Europe.

97
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:11,630
They do in many respects, a lot of Spain's and
Europe's dirty work, with respect to

98
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:15,980
blocking people whose interest is to
cross.

99
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,820
Another thing you'll notice is

100
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,610
that everyone in these camps is from
sub-Saharan Africa, basically countries

101
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,420
below this line.

102
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,010
All migrants face extreme difficulties in their journey to

103
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:32,789
Europe, but migrants from places like
Syria have a much easier time just

104
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:36,439
walking up to the border and asking for
asylum the proper way.

105
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,870
It's not an exaggeration to say that hardly any
sub-Saharan African is able to do that.

106
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:48,660
They do have to resort to very
dangerous methods, like scaling the

107
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,860
fences or hiding in vehicles or taking
to the sea.

108
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,660
Spain did build a new

109
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,700
office to handle the influx of migrants,
but not migrants from sub-Saharan Africa.

110
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,940
You might say well that's reasonable right? Everybody

111
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,390
knows there's a war in Syria, so of
course it makes sense to presume that

112
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:37,100
Syrians are fleeing the war and
they're refugees, they need protection.

113
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,410
But the flip side of that, the
presumption that people from countries

114
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,390
where there isn't like a live war, that
you are reading about in the newspapers,

115
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,320
the presumption that people from those
countries are not in need of

116
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,120
international protection, is a very
dangerous presumption.

117
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:03,020
The world is experiencing a record number of refugees
and displaced people. While some

118
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,459
countries have opened their doors to let
these people in, many are responding by

119
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:12,050
building walls, but this won't stop them
from coming. No matter how dangerous the

120
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,360
journey, the people in these camps will
keep trying.

121
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,779
That's the six episode of Borders, I hope
you've enjoyed this series. Today we also

122
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:36,190
launched the on-site experience for all
six of the Borders stories, with graphs

123
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,300
and charts and visualizations to kind of
go a little bit further into some of

124
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,589
these stories. I'm gonna leave a link
here where you can go see that and thank

125
00:10:44,589 --> 00:00:00,000
you for being a part of this journey.
