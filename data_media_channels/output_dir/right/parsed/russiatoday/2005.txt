yakatori burg Central Station is one of
the largest transport hubs in Russia
noisy and crowded of course there are
various ways of getting to Yekaterinburg
Cal Silva International Airport is 16
kilometers from the city it's well
connected with other Russian cities and
international destinations such as
Barcelona Prague Dubai and Helsinki by
transiting through Moscow you can fly to
Yekaterinburg from anywhere in the world
the airport has recently been
reconstructed and it's ready for the
fans
the plane is faster of course but the
Train is cheaper and the station's right
in the city centre very convenient there
are about 30 hotels within a radius of
just a couple of kilometers from the
Central Station if you choose another
part of the city a taxi from the station
to anywhere in the Ecuadorean Berg will
cost around 200 rubles or $4 you can
also take a bus or a tram and Ural skya
is just a few steps from the station
it's one of the city's 9 metro stations

for a distance I noticed an unusual
building looking rather like a
gingerbread house there right way you
know it turned out to be a railway
museum I'm not actually a fan of trains
but nevertheless it's interesting Marian
you know come on come on come on what
just sit - Julia come - it'd be more
cooperative guys
if you have time before the match and
you're interested in technology you
definitely need to drop in here the
museum houses dozens of railway models
rolling stock and communication lines
what's more the museum is interactive so
you can try your hand as a train driver
or traffic controller in Bordeaux es una

famoso train trans-siberian Oh
en la puerta a severe area is Asia
formal meant a style a Lopez de la
cordillera de los Morales while I was
recording another video for the blog the
guys got so carried away by the museum
exhibits but I had to persuade them to
leave we are only in Yekaterinburg for
two days and there's so much to see to
save money on a taxi we took a bus from
the station to our hostel yes how are
you - Doyle any matter I see a skull cap
is custard
what's it wasn't yeah
you remember this the conductor told us
a trip in the city is the same price on
all types of transport on the eve of the
FIFA World Cup new traffic lanes have
been constructed in Yekaterinburg to
reduce congestion a special website lets
you calculate any route in real time
after leaving our stuff in the hostel we
set off to explore the city it's quite
compact so the easiest way to move
around the centre is on foot in good
weather you can see all the important
sights in a couple of hours the central
park of cultural and leisure is a
must-see it's where the city's main fan
zone will open it will be the chief
focus point for fans if you didn't
manage to get to the stadium you can
sample the unique atmosphere of this
football tournament right here all the
World Cup games will be broadcast live
on giant screens dozens of cafes
restaurants and sports bars attractions
and many other entertainments await the
guests of the FIFA World Cup The Fan
Zone can accommodate up to 17,000 people
at a time and even bad weather sadly
common in the Urals won't spoil the
festivities the stadium will have indoor
stands with a capacity for 5,000 people
Yekaterinburg is a fairly young city by
Russian standards it's only 300 years
old
founded by Peter the Great it's imbued
with history it's also the place where
the last emperor nicholas ii together
with his wife and five children were
shot in the basement of a house where
today an orthodox cathedral stands the
city treats the old days with respect
19th century style interiors can often
be found even in modern restaurants
Sirach were too bad well okay we are
faith today we suffer it today so we
will go we will chill we see the city to
tell just now which one goes where you
looking to

lesson on it if we split into two teams
Luca and I were in the first one while
Sergei and Vitaly played for the second
one
Sports popular in Yekaterinburg everyday
you can watch a football match in small
stadiums in which people from one block
of flats compete against players from
another there's also a professional
football team Corral which plays in the
Russian Premier League according to
Russian tradition Mooka and I are
supposed to drink to victory but instead
we'll write these quick as the wind as
they say in Russia
Sergei of course shows off his
professional writing skills on these
specially created tracks perhaps he'd
even win the DECA and with no less
pleasure the winner of the Argentine
Rally drives off the road next to his
dacha let's go after a busy day he
understand how diverse and multifaceted
Yekaterinburg is it combines the
coziness of Prague the glass and
concrete of Shanghai and the refinement
and inspiration of soot Petersburg
after all it's a large metropolis with a
population of over a million the modern
industrial center of Russia there are
literally hundreds of hotels here but
according to the world cup organizing
committee about 200 thousand fans from
all over the world will descend on the
city so it's better to book rooms in
advance as we only came here for one
night we stayed at an inexpensive hostel
no no no lucky today I don't one thing
while mukha and vitaly were making tea i
decided to work and prepare for
tomorrow's interview at the stadium you

yakatori burg arena is being constructed
on the site of the old stadium built
back in 1956 the pitch will be open to
the elements that most spectator seats
will be under a canopy protected from
the Urals weather surprises during the
World Cup the arena will hold 35,000
spectators thanks to a temporary stand
after the tournament the capacity will
be reduced to 23,000 which is what Siva

the head of the Directorate for the
stadium's construction took me to the
very top of the temporary stand which
will be dismantled after the tournament
this eagle eye view is a great way to
see the stadium the constructions main
feature is that it extends beyond the
stadium's perimeter there are few
examples in the world of such an
innovative solution to the problem of
accommodating spectators another is the
stadium in são Paulo which hosted the
semi-final between Argentina and Holland

used for other events such as concerts
and the territory around the stadium
will be converted into a pedestrian area
perhaps the most famous pedestrian
street in Yekaterinburg alienate Viner

Berg's many bars to celebrate victory or
drown the sorrows of defeat you can get
to a special place by car or bus
Yekaterinburg is located entirely in
asia but most locals consider themselves
to be Europeans
after all the border with Europe is only
39 kilometers from the city on the road
right by the border you pass a majestic
monuments at first I didn't quite
understand what was special about it
it only dawned on me later why it's such
a unique monument who among us hasn't
dreamt of finding oneself in two places
at the same time well here it's possible
be accomplished pero lo siento que hacer
