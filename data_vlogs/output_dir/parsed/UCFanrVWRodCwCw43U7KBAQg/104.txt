pulling and it's just like you know and
I can start by having hot chocolates and
getting into my cozy socks and I'm
wearing like really like cozy
something's right now and I've also got
the cutest pajamas on as well so just
feel very like autumnal right now we're
just very excited and very happy however
everything I'm gonna be showing you
today is actually just like bright
bright bright colors like I don't think
you guys know how obsessed I am with
buying things that are like black I mean
have these things in my wardrobe is
black just because of the light you
can't really go wrong however everything
that I've got here I think is some sort
of like bright spring summer clothing I
guess so I hope you guys got it Sherman
knows I hope you guys to enjoy this
video special night and subscribe down
below if you guys haven't already and
let's get into it
okie dokie guys where to start if
actually I'm going to start with the job
that I'm wearing right now which is
probably the darkest thing I've got in
this entire haul so this jumper in sofa
thank you this job was actually very
very berry crops actually guys can see
right now but it is so cute it's kind of
like a washed out grey it's really comfy
and it kind of you can do it two ways
now I've actually typed this up so it's
tight around my wrist because obviously
it's elasticated and I've tied it into
little bows or you can actually have it
notice of like pick up arms and it also
looks really nice as well
but I thought for this hole it would
probably really annoy me so that's why I
haven't got the more list but of all I
will show you another time
like one the hatching this because they
look really cool so I got this from a
misguided I had a big a misguided
shopping haul so a lot it's gonna be
from there so the next thing is this
bread like leather looking jacket now
can I just say it's so flippin cool and
I've been also this is from so many
times because I've won it so many times
on my vlogging Channel in like pictures
and just videos and on my social media
and stuff and so many of you guys have
been asking me where this is from so
it's actually from Bershka and this is
what it looks like it is so cool I love
it it's AIT's a leather it's a poster
look like a leather jacket but actually
it's more like a plastic kind of fabric
so it's kind of like that wet looking
leather kind of look but it's really
cool however I as much as I love it I
feel like it's one of those things it
can look really cool and really edgy or
you can look like Michael Jackson or it
isn't really uncool and as much as I
love Michael Jackson he's one of my
biggest idols I don't really want to
look like him so I feel like this is
something you've really got to be
careful with what you wear it with
because it can really not look good
however I think if I'm wearing like all
black or something then it this
definitely does look really cool and I
have got a lot of wear out of this as
well so I am loving this and it wasn't
even very expensive as well considering
it's a jacket I think it was about 15 16
pounds so he knows things I've got to
show you guys and again right I know
like I'm so obsessed with clothes but I
think this is one of the best things I
own so these are also bred these are
these hills I got from a misguided and
you know what like from the fronton that
kind of average is actually my favorite
style of hills actually called like
office hills I just really like their
pointed toe I just think it looks really
like classy however longer back they
have flipping and bunny ears and it
looks so cute when you're actually
wearing these like I've never seen
anything so adorable in my life and
these weren't even that expensive either
I think there were maybe 25 pounds but
they also have these in black cream
white and I don't know there's any other
colors I just really liked the writers
go yeah I have
purchase these so thank you miss cited
for making at the cutest shoes I have
ever seen in my entire life
and I don't think I'll ever be wearing a
different pair of heels again I always
love Barbie but now misguided actually
have their own Barbie collection which
is so cool and I saw this bodysuit I
thought okay that is so cute you know
what though it looks so big what's why
so don't get it in so I got it in a size
8 but it looks really big so I think I
might have to send this back and get a
size down my mother was taking things
back so that's really going to me but
this is what it looks like it's like she
just a black body sooner than it just
says Barbie like a pale pink but I'm
going on holiday I'm hoping to go on
holiday soon so this will look really
cool like in the summer and I think I
could also wear it as a swimming is it a
swimming costume or just a bodysuit
I think it's lit you just the body see I
think I can easily wear it out of it is
it's a swimsuit I was gonna say the
fabric the fabric feels like it could be
a swimsuit so I think that could look
really cool on holiday so I picked that
up from misguided and since we're
talking about misguided and the Barbie
collection I also picked up this top
which I have actually worn before and
you guys are two rights from again so
it's this a camo top it's really cute
open wreath on your back camo like I
love it so much but I think some camo
can look really cheap however I really
like this I really like that it's got
the power paint neck and also just the
pale pink across it as well and also it
has like in the baby pink color house
barbie written across the chest so I
just think this was really nice it's
just really catch and it kind of goes
with anything is a little bit oversized
I think mine's a size 6 and it's it's
pretty big like it's the size of a
normal t-shirt so I'm loving this and
it's really cosy as well so yeah also
got that my favorite jeans all the time
I feel like you guys definitely would
have heard me talk about these because I
am so obsessed now I used to be one of
those people who were so obsessed with
Topshop Jony jeans and like don't get me
wrong I do like them but I just feel
like everybody wants dirty jeans now I'm
like I can support something in the
street but I'd be towel if you're
wearing Jody jeans because I just saw
there is no obvious you know so I'm kind
of what it's like switch thing
up a bit however I'm really funny with
and low-waisted things and I really like
stretchy high-waisted jeans so I don't
actually think these are actually mint
dries but for me they actually look
high-waisted so these are the Amala
jeans are from a violent and they are so
flattering they're still stretching and
even though they say mid rise they're
still kind of like high-waisted so I got
these bright blue one and this I just
thought was so nice I love them so so
much there's not really that much to say
about them I also liked the edges as
well how they're kind of like frayed I
just thought that looks really cool
really cute so I picked up these dreams
and I cannot wait to wear them then it
also got a like a washed out pair of
these as well which are even nicer but I
think they're even wash down which is
kind of I'm kind of got in because they
have my god the washed out ones I have a
thing is look so expensive like I would
guess they're like having Klein or
something like they're so nice so if you
guys are looking for a new pair of jeans
definitely check out the Marines from
River Island because they are so good
now I'm on this bikini on holiday I feel
like you guys are gonna know what bikini
it is now they don't actually go
together they're from the same shop but
they're not supposed to good they're not
supposed to like they're not set
basically so these are the bottoms
they're greater mic strikes and they're
really flattering they're really nice
and they're kind of like GQ four terms
and they go a little bit up your bum but
without you know having a full-on wedgie
and then this is the top that I bought
as well which is again really flattering
I really like the shape of this I have a
tiny bit of padding as well I really
don't like bikinis without padding so
this one was perfect for me so this is
what the top looks like and it's Navy
with white stripes and together it looks
really cool it looks like the like
American flag it just looks really cool
on and
this is a picture that I post on
Instagram where in Cikini and I got so
many compliments and also it was my
first picture to ever get a hundred
thousand likes on Instagram so thank you
so much guys we and I say we because
it's down to you guys and smashing the
game
so thank you so much for that and this
was from H&M and I think the top was
like $7.99 and the bottoms was about
$4.99
so so flippin cheating then from Topshop
this is kind of
a little bit plain but I just love the
color yellow so much hence my nails
hence my book hence everything else that
I work yeah pretty much
I've got my book tour this week and I
want to wear as many yellow clothes as I
can't because I just say you'll be so
cute because if you guys didn't know my
book is yellow so I wanted to kind of
match with my book so I bought this
little yellow crop top that I thought
would be so cute it's kind of like a
crop Tibet it's very thin it has the
really thin straps but I've had not in
this bright yellow color but I have this
in my black and white and they're really
comfy and it's quite stretchy as well
and I just really liked how it has that
rib going across another whole top so
this is what it looks like and it was
six pounds then and one of my favorite
things in this entire hole which is so
so nice but kind of say comes up really
small because I I'm normally like this
size 80 dresses however I have to get a
size 10 in this because it's really
uncomfortable
that you can't move well I can move so
it's a mini dress it's long seat
actually guys can tell it share on the
front with these a balloon but really
pretty flowers I just think it's
stunning overall and then underneath it
has like a thinly kind of like really
stretchy like the best dress don't
really know what to call it but
obviously so it isn't see-through then
at the back it's pretty much the same
thing however it has this little cutout
at the top which is so pretty as well
and then also zips up and down and down
the back so this is the dress and I want
to wear this somewhere really special I
think I have a good night out where I'm
celebrating in my whole book with the
publishers and my management and my
family so I think I might worried that
night because it's just so beautiful and
it just looks so expensive as well and I
think classy
however this is one of the more pricey
things I bought it was so surprised this
was 45 pounds which I mean it really
isn't that bad for such a beautiful
detailed dress however it's one
misguided so I respected it to be so
much cheaper but you know everybody's
definitely worth it so I had to purchase
this dress these are some heavy quieted
joking bottoms I've got these from at JD
Sports there were 25 pounds which again
I didn't rate
with that buyer considering its carving
client and they're really comfy so it
has the Calvin Klein
elasticated band at the top which is so
stretchy and then on the bottom as you
guys can see a healthy little
elasticated band as well services really
stretching these jokers so they are
super slim fit and when I say super
simple like there's so time so again if
any of you guys want to get these I
definitely recommend to size up but
they're so nice so comfy and also they
have pockets as well which is another
added bonus this is so pretty
so I also got from misguided again as
you guys can tell I've got a lot from
ask I did so this is a cover-up kimono
it's a coral color with like a paisley
pattern which I just think is so pretty
really gives me that like summer vibe
and I think again if I go abroad
somewhere I definitely will get a lot of
wear out of this and I just love
cover-up so much because I hate that
when you get off the beach or something
and you want to put some clothes on but
then I get in denim shorts is such a
struggle when it's like these are just
so easy and also look it's so so pretty
so I got from misguided I think it was
about 15 no about 25 pounds then another
bikini that I also wore a lot on my
recent holiday to Morocco is this a dark
gray mesh bikini again it's kind of like
the same style as the last bikini I mean
these are a little bit different the
bottoms but the top is exactly the same
style as the last bikini is the triangle
shape it has a little bit of padding
inside again also got this from H&M as
well as the last bikini again I think
the top was like $7.99 and the bottoms
like 399 so pretty much like really
affordable then my favorite thing in
this entire hole I don't know if I've
already said that I think I said that
about the shoes but this is also one of
my favorites and I went out last night
and I wore my I wore the body shoes with
this score and it's so it looks so good
guys so to actually show you guys what
I've been bragging on and talking about
is this white spot here it is so flippin
pretty it is so flattering so there
isn't really much to it it's just white
it's a skort Samba see is shorts and a
skirt like a skirt over the top so it's
a lot more flattering but I personally
think it's and
more flattering than just wearing shorts
because you kind of had that skirt to
cover up if you're looking a little bit
bloated also I just really liked how it
ties up on the sides and I really like
the monochrome look of the black and the
white I just thought you just looked
really good and really classy together
and that's all I have to say about them
but I love them
saffron are you flipping kidding me I've
got more things from he's got it okay
so I also got this score once I bought
that one I had to basically make another
another order look more scores because I
thought okay you actually have really
flattering and they're really nice so I
picked off this bright green score now
green isn't really one of my favorite
colors but I just thought this really
gave me some advice and I couldn't
really see myself wearing this in the UK
but definitely when I do go abroad and
it's so pretty it's another score just
basic like bright green however it's a
little bit different because it ties off
like in the middle so it ties up both
ways it's really kind of hard to show
you without me without me after you
having them on yeah it kind of like ties
up in the middle and then my fault of a
big like faux or not or whatever you
want to do to it I'm gonna leave the
links down below so you guys can have a
look you know and then also one last
thing from misguided is this grey score
as well I haven't tried this one on
again it's a little bit different this
one actually has a bow and it looks very
flattering again so fingers crossed
I hope so guys and it's kind of like a
really light washed grey but I do really
love the buckle at the front I think it
looks pretty cool so I got this pyjama
dress from Primark
if you guys want Victoria Secrets and
you're definitely gonna love this
because basically it looks exactly the
same but like a ton cheaper so this was
only eight pounds and it's a shirt dress
I think it would be so nice for bed and
I just think it looks so cuddly and I
just love the pink and white stripes and
I just love Victoria Secrets I'm Primark
so I thought well why not get one from
Primark when it's like five times
cheaper than a chrome yes because I used
to have one really similar to this and
then I grew out all day and it was like
it was so heartbreaking so I picked this
one up from Primark I'm gonna be moving
on it to my last item now but this is
why I wanted to show you about the Molly
jeans so these are the jeans that was
one of
Island I actually went downstairs to get
them off the wash to bring them back up
here so I hope you guys appreciate it
but these are the jeans they are so nice
they have the money jeans that mid-rise
i've got them in a size 8 and they're
just really nice I just washed out dead
and they have rips and the knees
couldn't like you're not too big and
then that's gonna say it's frayed at the
bottom when it's not but it is like you
know it's got my little slips and stuff
at the top and on the back as well but
yeah I thought these looked really good
and they remind me of like Calvin Klein
