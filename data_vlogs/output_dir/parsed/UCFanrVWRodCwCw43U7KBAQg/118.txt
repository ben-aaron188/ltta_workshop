so if you haven't seen them
please please don't check them out
because I know you've all of them I
actually got quite a bit when I was over
there when I think quite a bit like yeah
I spent all my money
I am bankrupt trying out like my bank is
basically crying at this very moment
pretty much everything I got was in from
an outlet so it's cheaper always in the
sale so I was very very lucky and I
think that's why it looks like I got
even more than I actually did I really
want to put my glasses on because I can
actually see when I have these on but
it's so annoying because the stupid
light reflects you know I spend money as
well to stop these reflecting on these
doors like I feel like a lot of you guys
would get annoyed if I wore these so
just let me know for next time if I'm
allowed to wear them or if you find them
annoying anyways I don't want to ramble
on for too long I won't try and go
through this quite quickly I'm also
going to be having a giveaway at the end
of these videos which is to do a

much and I wanted to do a giveaway I

subscribe if you guys haven't already
let's get in to this video I really know
this is going to be TMI showing you my
doors but I think I'm just going to go
for anyway so the third bag I've got is
Calvin Klein's going to go through this
quite quickly so I bought this bra I
mean I think it can be either a sports
bra or a bra it's so so nice the thing I
liked about it amazing the fact it
actually has padding in the bottom and I
really like the crisscross at the back
there was a $44 and it's normally $60 so
I've got a little while the moonlight
cheese but it was I got money off so I
felt pretty proud and then I also got
some underwear I love Calvin Klein
underwear because it's so comfortable
and that was a deal on a cot remember
but it was like you got fired for a
certain amount I think is like you say
$20 or something so I've got black pair
another back pair white pair great pair
and I think I got another white pair but
I probably won them and I'm not going to
start showing you dirty underwear so
that is why got from Calvin Klein moving
on okay okay okay
so I got a lot from forever 21 I got a
lot from their outlet and we're learning
a lot I mean a lot okay so the first
thing that I'm going to show you because
this I wore in a few my Instagram
pictures I'll pull up direction
somewhere and so maybe if I started
asking me whether it's from it is so
cool immediately I fell in love with it
I love the color and it's really cool
when it's like done up and braided
actually one of my favorite colors never
needs to be but I love loving red at the
moment so I got this jacket I think it
was it was $22 from forever 21 I don't
think you've ever seen this because I
kind of want underneath another top
which I will show you so it's a kind of
like a lime green a bodysuit
but it's just such a pretty lime green
and it was like a really nice
collaborators roost and it is was $7 60
and I wore it under this mesh top in an
Instagram picture I don't know where it
just now I will show you somewhere like
somehow like throughout the whole also
from forever 21 I got this really cool
kind of like oversized baseball top I
really liked it again I immediately like
saw it and automatically it was like
again is that so badly
it's just AIDS stripes and Facebook top
again I will post the picture that I
actually put some Instagram so beautiful
after I go from and I really liked the
fact that it had Arden Lynette it was
$11 60 or a member because I remember
seeing it thinking got that cheap you
would not find that in Topshop of
somewhere else
also if you follow my snapchat you would
have seen this was ten dollars 19 now
the reason I have to pick this up is
because my favorite
are my dark and white bands and then you
can duck you light there I have the
plain ones and I have one of them
carries on it and I wasn't so much and
it's like a lot of you going to
recognize me from wearing my band so I
thought I'd have to get this cat and I
think it would be so cool like I'm not
going to put one out through my hair
like a snapback okay doesn't look good
like this but I think it what about
pretty cool words like a snapback
there are bits of this one it is a
bright orange top it is really cool when
it's tied up like this so I have to tie
up to show you because that's how I saw
on the module on that slide vision
myself wearing yeah I don't know if you
remember the exact size of this next
item I'm pretty sure a 7.65 entirely
sure again it's all from the outfit that
was quite affordable so it's this really
really nice beige kind of like a red
crop top I really like the concept in
going down the top I think you just made
it look really cute really pretty I wore
this bloke with the pearls like long
shorts and I was out there nowadays I
haven't actually had a chance to wear so
it's another crop top I really like it
and realizing material because it's so
nice the fabric is so nice
it basically the crop top that hangs
like really low at the back I think if I
were either a really nice lace bralette
like on the back of wearing this look it
was a really nice fall vegetable
wherever at all it was it really nice
it's one of those ones that's like
looked super comfy so as you get it this
was $12 90 and then I also picked up
this basic shift dress from forever 21
and this is khaki green and again the
sub Brook is really nice well varies a
lot tighter than I thought it would be
like this kind of skin type
I thought it would be more like the
shift dress it was also skin tight so
with that everything in back forever 21
5 so we're going to move on to another
fad now okay I eventually got on the top
so this is the time I was talking about
that I wore over light greens wedding
soon so nice I think it's my favorite
pop I actually own in my wardrobe so
it's a white mesh top it means a boner
washing precedes excuse plantation mark
haven't had chance to wash it yet but
wanted to show you guys it's a white
mesh top the thing I love about it the
most if the fabric it has on the front
is two cherries there's like two
cherries like on your boobs
and it just it looks so flippin Q on
again I wrote the picture of me actually
wearing it but it looks so nice and
honestly this entire outfit I wore in
this picture I think you've made a
favorite outfit that I've ever worn now
I've got so many questions about
everything from the shop so when I went
to America there were the shop I've
never heard him before and I just bought
some really nice shoes and with no
source of immense welcome in I don't
know if I'm pronouncing it wrong I think
it's Charlotte Rossi Rossi is about ru
SS e so I think it's Charlotte rusty but
I might be flatly wrong or they're going
to say I didn't actually have bad with
this shop so I try to look for online I
just went on the online store and it is
amazing so if you get chance to look in
the shop go through such a nice shot so
the first thing I got from that was
these really really nice Hills they are
so nice I really like the fact that they
go a little bit higher than your ankle
edges so they're really cool
however like crisscross it was like $25
each or if you've got two pairs like $75
so until I have to grab two in that they
were only ten dollars so these are the
other kind of help I got there kind of a
company that's a little bit more
everyday Hill they're not so dressy I
really like peak toed kills as well I
did a lot my toes but recently the fall
of mobile channel you will know you know
this goes on so strange but I got to
nail extension on my big toes and now my
toes are so much better
so I'm so glad I actually got those done
because I will wear peep-toe heels and I
don't actually mind maybe as much so
again these I love and they are from
Charlotte Russell I think then so many
people again are aware this is from on
my Instagram and these are definitely my
favorite shorts I own so these are these
stripes maybe and white short day of
service a stirring they are so comfy
they're like they're not really
they don't super stretchy because they
are denim but it still really stretchy
they are like the best things I have
ever ever bought and they might even
like a candy shop
like I think these look so good with
Reds as well like if you wear like the
words it with this is
so good again I'm going to put my
Instagram's when you can actually see me
wearing this on holiday I don't know how
much these were asshole honestly I could
not have you I can't remember but if you
have them online so I will need
everything I can find down below because
I did see these earlier on the store by
the way I haven't just got clothes
I've got makeup I've got kind of like a
bit of everything I'm just trying to go
through it quite fast so also from the
same shot actually I wanted in my
research so I've gone loads of it it was
really hard disabled by what is in my
brief of video with all email and so
many people service from and it is a
bodysuit so it's a suede bodysuit I
really like how it's like very low at
the front I really like how it's like a
v-shape and it's also off the shoulders
as well again it's very comfy on it's
like just that suede material so another
off the shoulder top
I haven't had chance to wait yet again
it's really pretty
it's suede again in fact it is very
similar however at the top it's more
like a beige a brown color and it's
really pretty
it is one of the five things I bought
the shop this was at $19.99 and it's
these kind of mustard colored a really
pretty then I have my little sore fouls
on them and then it also like ties up at
the front here which makes it look that
extra kind of like special and I really
like the fact I was like different
layers and it's shorter at the front
than it is at the back as well so when
it's on it fits really nicely so these I
thought were really pretty I love
shopping for clothes for my favorite
thing to buy is home decor so okay why
didn't I show you this in the beginning
so I bought this pillow which is so so
nice I know you guys will love it too
and it says stay in bed and it's in gold
and then it's kind of like it's it's
more difficult for NorAm ingredient I
think it's more like a Lima green and it
fades into a wire then it has a gold rim
going around which is just so pretty it
really wasn't that expensive and I going
it from Target just to talk
I picked up there and it goes so nicely
all the other clothes my bed because
I've been trying to have my ball color
and I really like green and yellow like
on my bed as you guys can tell by the
other pillows are completely moving off
topic now I only have a little Sephora
bag which is actually quite surprising
to most people actually bought three
phase Mars one I did use but the one I
have left is their own space masks these
are these are for masks they are so good
they have six dollars for the face mask
and then they are five dollars the eye
mask and this is an avocado I'm on if
you don't like avocado but I really like
the smell of it so that's why I picked
up these abuses one before and it
actually works so well there you leave
your skin feeling really moisturized and
just like fashion just like and this one
is supposed to moisturize and brighten
your face smell - I picked up those I
picked up two blushes because I don't
really ever actually go out on by
brushes by really into blush now it's
summertime but I think it's so pretty
I bought this more light blush this is
sweet on you
number five by Sephora I loved better as
well so I bought this Becca kind of like
shimmery blush it's a little bit darker
and this is in the shade Snapdragon now
from it the night store so again this
was actually a night outlet I don't know
why it really really really confuses me
any night store or any ancestor here
they don't sell yoga shorts and I find
it so J's when I go to America I tend to
buy the yoga shorts because by women
every time I go to the gym because I so
can't see sometimes have shorts over the
top and sometimes just on their own so I
saw these really cool one to be honest
actually wanted black ones but they sold
out of my side so I ended up getting
these one and they are so so nice they
are like king of a little bit of black a
little bit of red they say like pro on
the top these are the better in short
they are so so so stretchy so
comfortable the best thing to workout in
and I really love the design
I immediately fell in love with
so it's a baggie light gray kind of
bloke was kind of a washout gray pine
top and it says there is no finish line
I just really like the colors I really
like the green and blue on the gray so
that's why I have to get that I've got
them totally doing this in the wrong
water because we're going back to target
now I just realized I had another person
target they only have really really
really good Jim Webb now I last wore
bras was padding because then it means I
don't have to wear a bra a lobby the
moment me when they wear a sports bra
and I wear a bra but I just like to have
that extra color so this one actually
has a little padding and green eyes and
I don't need to ever I'll with it which
is so much better
and it is so cute now one's quite a bit
of a target at law it basically zips up
in the middle so you can unzip it you
know you want to be a little bit cheeky
I just keep it zipped up I think it was
about 25 dollars also thought because I
just need you gym wear so it's a bright
pink vest top it's not really much to
say about it
and then I've also got a nice horse
broke again is resupport him and it fits
the books out model design if that was
the word I was looking for and again
equals on the back and it is about the
same price is about 25 dollars gonna
move on it seemed autre now see funny I
want to talk about what you yes and that
you would have heard me talk about to my
blogs because I have been raving about
this girl I was so excited when I got it
and then I tried it on I was like I was
shook like one of those like this
is amazing
I have it on my face right now I don't
know if you can tell because I have this
makeup on so like a good like six hours
now so it doesn't really look that great
so I got always some videos when I'm
looking my life it is the classic hot
shake tape concealer it is unbelievable
if these anything be like I've ever
tried it's very expensive it's $25 for
honestly I would rather spend more money
on something I know that actually works
and this does work I actually bought the
shade fair beige which is the second to
lightest shade I went into older and I
just needed a new writer so
picked up the shade extra which is a
matter edge I didn't really think it was
going to be that special we just got
it's a brand that's quite nice this is
again it's not going to like tighten for
my favorite price ever like it is an
amazing brand I've never had anything
for bed it just isn't amazing so then I
was expecting amazing it and enjoy and
every race that I've been wearing on my
Instagram recently happy in this race I
literally I had to go back into the shop
to get to because I never want to run
out of this stuff and then I also got a
liner to go with it as well so this is
in the shade 30 the final thing some
show you guys I'm getting my second
response what do you ask is not even
real I use the thing like how people be
so upset with my encounters languages
