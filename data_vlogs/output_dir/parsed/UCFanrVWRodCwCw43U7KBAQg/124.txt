seen if I actually went to Ibiza I had
the most amazing time and I actually
went with the brand called I saw it
first which is the brand I'm going to be
hauling for you guys today so I went
over there has the best time loved ultra
all the dolls that went as well was so
lovely it was so nice to hang out with
my friends and I meet new friends
himself overall the trip was amazing so
if you haven't in the vlog I'm also
going to leave the vlogs down below for
you guys to go and check out basically
majority of the stuff that I walk over
there was actually from I 405 so I
thought oh I don't give you guys a
clothing haul so that's what I'm going
to do today so I hope you guys enjoy the
video if you do then peace brush I like
to subscribe to down below if you guys
haven't already and finally let's get in
to the video what's the first thing I'm
going to talk about definitely shelves
summer so basically it's this printed
cami desktop is so so lovely I didn't
actually get the chance to wear it out
there by definitely will be wearing your
on my next adventure wherever that may
be
so yeah pretty much it's tummy is really
nice because it's like cropped and the
thing I like about it the most is the
fact that it's like is enough located at
the bottom so it's kind of supposed to
that like it's rolled over but actually
it's just pretty much a crop coming and
then it has like lace across the top as
well which is so pretty and I'm honestly
kind I can't remember half the prices so
I'm going to leave all the prices to
everything on the screen but this is
just so easy and like to wear I will
pretty much go with anything so I
thought I definitely must pick this up I
love camis overall so when I saw this
one I was like oh yeah next up is
actually one of my favorite things that
I bought throughout this entire haul
this is so so cool so basically it's a
car key mini dress it's got like a lot
of detailing on it so it has the like
cross lace that you guys know that I
love going down the front so it has a
lot of detail on the front and then it
that has the detailing on the bottom as
well where it's kind of like cross star
places are distinct so cool and I love
the color color green I really like the
I like chunky neck as well I just
thought was really cool you guys have
seen me probably wear sony tops like
this well it has the like cut out to
connect as and they're like detailing
going down so when I saw it in like a
shift kind of like dress format I
thought okay yeah that's definitely a
must so I will be working this probably
in the summer and during winter because
it's kind of like a casket kind of like
a more wintry color but at the same time
I think because it's a mini dress it
will look really cute in the summer as
well so I'm very excited to actually get
to wear this one out this next one I can
tell if I wanted out so many of you guys
will be begging me so Eric's from this
is so cool this is so me so basically
it's a floral ripped light pink kind of
like key it's a really really pretty
kind of a keys more like a coral kind of
pink is a really pretty summery pink and
then it has roses on it you guys know I
love roses it's actually my favorite
flowers so it's got like roses coming
down which is really really nice
detailing because there's fabric is like
a little bit of stick dough and it kind
of looks like 3d like on the t-shirt
which is really cool and then again it
has the cuffs out kind of choked up it
has lots of flips and rips like
throughout the top and the bottom it has
like a really big slit which I just
think is really cool you guys know I
love the good old flips and rips and cut
our pieces in my clothing so yeah I saw
this and I pretty much thought okay
that's Sony also as well can I just say
the fabrics like really light as well so
it hangs really nicely it's also really
comfortable to wear so this is something
you could literally just put on with
like a plain pair of jeans and it would
just look really cool but also it would
look really comfy as well right let's
see what's next up in my bag okay the
next thing I've got I bought this when I
was actually in Ibiza and so many of you
guys are so wise from all I get I am
like obsessed so I think it's like one
of my favorite items in my entire
wardrobe side
pretty much wait let me get it right now
round it is just a really long black
commode
I'm going to need some pictures on the
screen of me actually wearing it right
now you guys seem to love this I love it
so much you can pretty much wear
anything because always you're wearing
heels I think I mean you probably could
wear that I have more likely world with
Hills but it just makes any outfit just
look so much more classy and like more
expensive I don't know why and I can't
really say knit but it just it looks so
like mature and just overall so pretty
so I'm fully upset also if you're like
feeling a bit bloated whether you just
sew this on and you look good whatever
so yeah for sizing by the way because
I'm sure a lot of people will want to
know I am quite small I'm actually 5
foot 1 and I have a size 10 in this just
because so 10 60 well the 8 I thought
was a little bit too short and I'm
actually quite small anyway so I thought
I'd just let you guys know on the sizing
for that because I'm quite small and I
have to have a size 10 in that
my name's items a little bit Plain Jane
it's pretty much as they're a plain grey
at key I just wanted like you know a
t-shirt you just want to you just at
home and you just want to whack on some
jeans and just put on a comfy t-shirt
well I just haven't had that t-shirt and
my wardrobe for such a long time I don't
know why like I literally don't own like
I play white or black or gray top so
when I saw this tea I thought it looks
really comfy I may as well get it it
really was a very pricey either it hangs
really nice on as well so I thought I
would just pick this one up not really
much to say about it pretty basic but
I'm probably going to wear it probably
more than anything I've showed you to be
honest the next item is so freaky and I
cannot wait to wear this out it kind of
reminded me of Tammy Hembrough
I don't know if you guys follow her on
Instagram but this is kind of like her
style the more like square dresses so
it's like a square mini dress it kind of
like looks at like ripped material which
I thought was really nice as well it's
off the shoulders
but it's long sleeved and then yeah it
pretty much it looks kind of like a body
con it has a little bit of a shape to it
which I quite liked the back to actually
went in and out because if it was just
kind of went box it would have been
really unflattering but the fabrics
actually release a Turing and it's quite
soon as well so I also picked this up
which I love also really don't oh no
plain black dress either so yeah can I
wait to learn that one about two got
another dress this dress
I will recently and you guys are two
ways from I love this but it's dirty
because I haven't had time to put in the
horse yet unless you were like two days
ago and I don't know why it hasn't gone
in the washing yet and is so gross but
basically it is really cool now I can't
really tell you what the fabric feels
like is a really weird fabric but it is
super comfy but honestly I can't even
tell you what the fabric is but
basically it's like a shift dress like a
slow shift dress so it's not tight at
all I don't mind in the color white I
think there was a couple I thought I
ordered another color of it because
really I happen but again it's got the
like cross detailing going down the
front it's low sleeve which I really
really like as well awesome it has the
collar which I think just makes it look
really cool and makes it look a little
bit different so yeah I picked this up
and you guys have been asking where this
is from
if you just wore this like with some
slaps and like a denim jacket and it's
really cool but also that you could
definitely dress it up an evening on
well that kills and stuff with it as
well either way I think it would look
really nice in a daytime or nighttime
I forgot I even got these okay these are
really cool now I own a lot of fun
goddesses and I also own a lot of rose
gold sunglasses I used to have blue ones
but I love them a while back so so I got
these kind of like greeny blue like
mirrored alligator like sunglasses I
just saw they were really cool I just
saw they were a little bit different I
just really nice a factor in marriage I
just yeah I just thought I've never
really seen any glasses like this and
like the actual shape of the glass is
the Aviator kind of shape of my favorite
like shape of glasses you just can't
really go wrong so I thought why not
maybe with the toss off some of
stuff I haven't actually even tried on
myself yet this is one of the things
that I haven't taken the tag off yet but
it will get a lot of use out of because
next week I'm going to Florida so if you
don't find my blogging channel then you
definitely share because I'm going to be
blogging the whole trip my family have a
house out there so I used to go out
there quite a bit and it's just like
it's like my second home it's my
favorite place ever
so if you put in the vlogs and then
we're wearing half this stuff out of
there
moving on quite quickly sorry guys I got
quite a lot of stuff so I got these
really cool shoes I'm just trying to get
them out the box I love so much
so I also picked up these Lucky's flat
sandal now as I'm going away I need it
of some sandals I actually don't really
own very many basically I threw out
nobody throw out I gave it to a friend's
family you guys like those faces I gave
away like all of my not all of them okay
a lot of my clothes they gave away a lot
of my clothes and I actually own all of
that on my channel so you may
have seen that how much I had to get rid
of and so now I don't actually have that
many clothes
why do but I don't really have any
sandals basically so I picked up these
ones they're really called the blacks
are pretty simple I really like the gold
white little rings for gold detailing
I think definitely make it look a little
bit more classy and a bit edgy cool I
just saw the look of these were really
cool and I really like the fact that do
you like crossover and she goes up to
the ankle kind of like Rises way up I
think was really cool and then also I
like the fact these like little gold
rings on the shoe the gold detailing I
think makes it look a little bit more
cool as well so all the fit Caesar again
can't remember the price before leave it
on the screen for you guys now these are
something I am so excited to wear like I
don't know where I'm giving away this
but I'm so excited when I do it this
gold choker but it has these like gold
thin chains hanging down both the side
and I just thought it looked I just
thought what if you're just wanting so
quickly it's rose gold it kind of like
it dangles down so I'm not
I think this if I tie it around my neck
and then these little dangle down but I
just again I just thought it looked
really classy I thought you loved three
Spence it as well and I just love the
color and gold so I'm very excited to
wear this just because it's so pretty so
cool I actually turn that way I actually
cannot wait to wear that I just realized
that my ribbed kind of dress that I
showed you also came with the choker as
well which actually will make the
dressing so much nicer so I forgot to
show you that but it does actually come
with a little choker as well Hey
and the final thing I've got to show you
is a another long thin kimonos so it's
the same as the black one I got but this
is what color doesn't say it is it's
kind of like a mesh duster long-sleeve
tie waist kimono I'm not really sure
what the color is to be honest it's kind
of like a dark kind of like no it's kind
of like a darkish pink it's a really
pretty color can't really work out
what's the cause of color more like a
dusty kind of rose pink I'll probably
say but yes pretty much
another kimono because I'm saucer to my
black one and I can't be seen and
wearing the back ran out everywhere I go
so I got another color as well and I'm
thinking of ordering a white one as well
because I think the white was a gritty
pretty as well what so guys there was
