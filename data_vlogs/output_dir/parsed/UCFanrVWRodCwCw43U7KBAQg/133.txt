hi everybody and welcome back to my
channel now for this video I'm hoping
this good Riperton I have achieved on
this video once already and I was
actually so proud of it I was like yes
this is going to be such a good video
come with me go to see it and turns out
them by sauce I'm on the bikes up you
get notes out so I wrote it back it goes
from me talking with no sound and it's
upsetting
so here again some of this video so hope
you guys enjoy it birth today I'm going
to be telling you guys what is in my
everyday makeup bag so this is my makeup
bag but I've been using it currently and
this is actually from the Kylie
collection this is her winter collection
feels like a silver metallic the makeup
bag actually love it because you can get
a lot inside is actually really
reasonable like it's not too small but
also not huge so it's like the perfect
size you can get so much makeup inside
of it then on the front
obviously it has Kylie's lips and then
on the back in like I don't know if I'm
just like outlines it has Kylie's name
so this is the major bag that's I use
and inside I mean I'm kind of like 50/50
with drugstore and high-end I don't
really love well I probably love
high-end more than I love drugstore but
if you double transfer as well because
it's amazing and it's so affordable also
inside of my everyday makeup bag I need
this is the makeup that I take out every
single day and when I set every single
day like even if I'm just popping into
town I would take his makeup bag with me
and the reason being is because
everything inside is makeup that I know
I love that I always will love and it's
kind of makeup just to top up my makeup
now and then or miss something goes
wrong I have like a disaster then this
is just great because just like they're
you know it's makeup but I know that
will work and it's just that so this
isn't the makeup that I necessarily wear
every single morning but it is the
makeup that I will take out if I'm
having a problem or veges from top up or
you kind of feel like you get the gist
by now so I hope you guys enjoy the
video if you do please smash a big
thumbs up and also subscribe down below
if you guys haven't already
and finally because I did actually tweet
over on Twitter because I'm going to do
over on Twitter
I prepared saying what do you guys want
to see either what's inside of my tower
the back pad or what's inside of my
makeup bag and you guys voted this one
but I don't really want to film my I'll
be back pass what's inside so let me
know if we want to see that down in the
comments as well but yeah I've read Ward
quite there so I hope you guys enjoy the
video and let's get into it so the first
thing that's inside of my makeup bag is
Aziz we owned perfectioning foundation
this is honestly amazing it's my go-to
foundation at the moment because well
I've just been absolutely and loving it
it's so easy to apply to your skin is
refle coverage which i love my favorite
reason why I love this foundation is
actually because of the color that I
have so I actually have the color 14
vanilla which is actually supposed to be
for people with mixed race and darker
skin I find with a lot of darker
foundation if I want to go a bit darker
it means I just look orange because I
don't have the natural warm in it like
on my skin because I'm naturally so pale
but this one it's just like such a warm
creamy foundation that it works so well
it just doesn't look orange so I really
love the color of the foundation I saw
like I probably should have gone with
primer fast but never mind so salt
primer I actually use the toothpaste
hello the primer actually won their
newest primers it's really nice because
it's really moisturizing that's why I
love it I mean I don't really know why I
take out a primal with me in my everyday
makeup bag because to be honest if I
remember like chopping up my makeup I
don't ever really top up my Prai
multiple gods destructor but I do love
this so I do just take it out just in
case of emergency you know anything is
when I mean it's crazy that it's such a
big tube because you get a lot inside
obviously the lids like really long and
it takes up quite a lot of space inside
my makeup bag so anyone annoying things
but it is overall a really good prime
court bronzer I've been using the bush
wall Paris
this is great just for a backup bronzer
it will always always always work again
it's pretty affordable because it's in
the drugstore this is actually the duo
palette though so this is the bronzing
and highlighting palette I haven't
really used the highlight that much so I
can't really say anything about it but
the bronze that is amazing because it's
a really nice and a warm bronzer it
definitely gives you that sunkissed look
so it's not particularly great for like
contouring your face with it won't give
you a really defined cheekbone if that's
really what you're like venturing out to
do what you really want but it will
definitely give you that sunkissed kind
of glow and it is overall a really
pretty bronzer that will always always
work so I always carry this around and
then love it talking about bronzer the
next thing I actually have inside of my
makeup bag is this chubby stick by sneak
and this is my contour stick it was
actually say foundation stick but I'm
looking at the shade of it I don't think
I would ever use this but this is in the
shade 28 curviest clothes but this is
again something that will always work
I've been using this since I was I think
in like India a in high school is that
one of the first things I ever purchased
from actually watching another youtuber
so this is amazing just because it's a
contour stick but it's one of those that
is really really buildable so it can
give you honestly the most natural look
if that's what you want or you can build
it up and build up and build up and it
won't look really really fit coverage
but you can definitely obviously make
your cheekbones and your jawline and
your forehead or whatever you feel like
more defined easily so it's really easy
to build up so easy to blend and it
would never ever ever look cakey on the
skin so again it's another one that's so
easy just to tape around with me because
yeah this is so easy for concealer I
have been loving it be two-faced Born
This Way concealer it is really really
great I mean it's quite thick but it's
so easy to blend it's also very creamy
as well
love the shades that I've got however it
doesn't actually say what shade I've got
so I will leave that down below or find
out what chaser said yeah everybody's a
really good concealer it lasts ages as
well and I just I mainly love this for
how creamy in and how easy it is to
blend and it's also great for covering
spots as well as it is for highlighting
your skin as well however I never ever
ever going to replace my baby and this
is the collection and last infection
concealer this is a cadet I mean all the
writers I've died I think I probably
have another one somewhere in my makeup
bag because honestly I think if I just
went out on one of these it would give
me so much anxiety because it's just
something I know that works and if I
don't take it out with me it's like I
don't know I think I would hate it so I
always make sure I backup of these I use
the shade fair light and again a
different feel is amazing I think it's
like it's like 2059 in like any
drugstore it's really affordable and
also you always get three for the price
of two as well just agree for blusher
I've got this Mac Russia and it's in the
shade desert rose honestly I've had this
for so long now it is a really really
basic brush light quite a bit darky kind
of rosy color it's not particularly
absolutely amazing but as the safety
wrong with me because honestly if I'm
blush is really hard to find nice ones
and so I definitely do you need to
splurge out and get some more brushes
this is one that again just kind of
always work for me and it's one that
looks pretty good
everything loves in a really long time
very I've had it for years
so always eggs out with me as well oh my
favorite part so this is highlighters so
while I've been loving at the moment
this is the new look of bathed highlight
powder and this is honestly so so
stunning it's really really pretty now I
have actually probably used highlighters
that work better than this one that
would give me more of a glow but the
reason I actually love this so much is
because fancy is never slush on me which
is
a really big deal because I drop my
makeup bag a lot I drop I'm just ready
under such a clumsy person so this one
has really work for me because so far
hasn't smashed and it's just really
nicely sits in the palette also another
thing that I love about this and when
comparing it to others and Slow is it
doesn't have much fullback which I love
as well so it's like a very stable
highlighter that won't break touch would
have absolutely nowhere to touch I do I
do have another option when it comes to
highlighters because you guys know I'm
fully obsessed and for like you honestly
can never have enough highlighters so
this one is the Becca highlighter and
this is in the shade moonstone it's such
a pretty compact obviously I love this
as well because this one actually has a
mirror inside and I think this is the
only thing I take out that has a mirror
inside so I love this and most people
actually love better champagne pop the
most highlighter I'm sure you've
probably heard like a thousand people
raved about it and I have myself until I
tried this one but this I just think is
so much prettier because it's more of a
whitish shimmer but it's a little bit
more golden that then it's the new look
one that I use so this is very pigmented
very pretty love the compacts love the
fact that it has a mirror so also take
this one out as well when it comes to
lipstick I actually have quite a very
option just because I own see can never
go out without lipstick even if I might
no makeup out I will have to wear
something on my lips because I never
just was so strange and not wearing
lipstick like it is my lips aren't dry
they just still dry they just feel I
don't know something about it I just I
just can't do it so I would make sure
I've got quite a bit of option and
running anza lipstick so one of my
favorite lipsticks
ever that I've had for such a long time
this is the revlon matte balm and this
is in the shade 265 sphere it doesn't
look it now it actually looks dead it's
very blunt and it doesn't quite know
like a crayon but when you buy these is
really really good because they're like
a very sharp line
it's like crayons so if you don't to use
their site as you know a base of a
lipstick you can actually use it to line
your lips which is pretty good as well I
always get ourself Ronna what it's the
color have you got on and it's like okay
you get ready for this because I never
ever ever just wear one lipstick I don't
know why it's really annoying but I
don't know I just can never find the
perfect I find a lot of perfect shade
the ones that go so well together so I'm
always wearing like more than one
lipstick I was like okay get ready and
just once named about five lipsticks so
here it goes
I know it must be so frustrating just
kind of have to get all three to wear
what I'm wearing I'm also wearing this
one that I have been loving recently and
this is from a new look and this is in
the shade new pink and it's a masked
liquid lipstick it's such a pretty color
however I don't think I would ever wear
on my own because it's such a pale pink
that I don't really think it would suit
me however when I wear it with that Matt
Baume it actually looks so nice together
like going on break and that is what I
wear my lips right now as well as a
gloss that I will show you so this is
the gloss I have on the top and this is
only made last by Rimmel and I mean I
was actually so surprised how hard it is
to get ex-mayor gloss now it's like a
couple of weeks back I went into town Oh
number time I went to town literally
just looking for its new gloss for the
days that I want to make about and
wanted just to wear something on my lips
and it was so hard I was looking in like
boots and Superdrug like due to 15
minutes until I could find something and
I came across this Rimmel one it was the
first one I came across after so long
searching for one I mean I couldn't say
it's the most amazing blossom ever tried
it's just literally cleared off you
can't really go wrong so I always take
this one around with me but whilst I was
looking for a clear gloss which and love
this one as well this isn't actually
particularly a clear gloss but this is
more like a shimmer like
pinky gloss I mean it just have a light
pink kind of tone and so it is really
really pretty really shimmery kind of
gloss and this is by Max Factor and
again I love this one as well I would
use either one of these on their own I
mean if we use this on more in its own
because it has a little bit of shimmer
in it a bit of sparkle and then finally
for lipstick I actually take around with
me every single day and this is the
anasazi are stripped liquid lipstick now
if I were to use a lipstick on its own
it probably would be this one because
it's such a pretty nude pinkish I mean
yeah it will renew be kind of color but
it's just so pretty and it dries in such
a nice matte on your lips as well
without being too dry
I love all these lipsticks but this one
is my favorite take one with me every
single day in my makeup bag the scar I
recently I have been using at the
Maybelline the falsies push-up drama
mascara
honestly this is amazing I recommend it
to any of you guys it's art it's simply
good maybe because it's like jet black
it's amazing also it's lasted me such a
long time I love the brush so much
because it's really really great at
spreading up your lashes and just making
them looking so for so thick so long
I always because there's one bad thing
about this mascara so is definitely one
that I would recommend I actually used
the Rimmel London liquid liner again
this is great I've used it actually for
such a long time it's really great
because again it's so jet black and I
think if you have a line of it is in jet
black and I just doesn't really give
like the same effect in my opinion so I
love their it's jet black although the
brush is like so thin at the end as well
so it's so easy to give you that kind of
like ariana grande look at the end and
again it's so easy to apply here we are
I do actually have another collection
lasting perfection concealer I just tell
you I would have another one just
because I honestly don't have got the
house without a loose having a backup I
also have there's a setting spray and
this is by Smashbox this is
their photo finished priming water this
is great just to set your makeup I
really like it as well because you get a
lot in there that will last you a long
time but it's not like a massive tube so
it fits really really nicely in my
makeup bag I do actually prefer the Mac
prep and prime which I do use a lot but
that's really big to take out for this
one I take out because it's a lot
smaller so now we're going to move on to
my mind sentiments like my makeup bag I
feel like it's like a Mary Poppins
makeup bag like this just more and more
and more so something I always take with
me is a pair of mini scissors mainly for
when I want to cut eyelashes but also as
well I just feel like you always
something your life you're going to need
a pair of scissors and not many people
carry a pair of scissors around with
them apart from me I've got your back as
we're talking about eyelashes I also
take out a pair of tweezers because you
need to resist it put on eyelashes what
I do I literally cannot put on my
eyelashes but if you've treated they
will not be going on my eyes so okay
these tweezers
these are actually a pound from Primark
and I love these I've had these for such
a long time and then yeah I have another
pair of tweezers as well I don't really
know why I got two I don't know where
these ones are from I needed just like
basic silver not as cute tweezers and
then of course I have eyelash glue
I do actually wear eyelashes pretty much
I would think I would wear them a good
five times a week so I wear them nearly
every single day hence why I'm going to
have the whole kit inside my bag and I
would never use any other eyelash glue
than zero honestly is these best eyelash
glue whatever use because it dries clear
it it dries so quickly
it's so amazing it holds so much better
than any other Irish flute I've ever
tried before so if you're looking for a
good eyelash glue or a few struggle to
put on your eyelashes then I would
actually recommend to get this because
this will be your life changer so when
it comes to brushes I don't actually
have that many and apply my makeup bag
and the reason being is because I
actually use my Beauty Blender a lot
because it's so
you take around and okay here is my very
overused dirty kind of scruffy
Beautyblender I probably should have
washed this and to be honest I was going
to but then I kind of thought you know
what I'm not going to pretend I have
this like perfect perfect life this
perfect makeup bag all my brushes are
always cleaned because they're not I'm
just going to keep it real with you guys
I've had this we'll probably like a good
four five months now which is so
overused I know I should definitely get
a new one I definitely will um very soon
in fact yeah this is actually my Beauty
Blender I was going to wash it but I
just don't know this is it this is what
this woodenness I currently I do wash it
quite a bit but it's very mucky at the
moment so there really is no point in
taking out brushes especially because
they take up so much room inside my
makeup bag that I just see no point in
taking around loads and loads of brushes
I do use brushes a lot when I'm at home
just because of the space and type of a
makeup bag and because I don't want it
to be super heavy I just pretty much
take on my Beauty Blender however I have
got a couple of brushes I do always take
out with me firstly it this spoolie I
couldn't even possibly tell you where
this from I haven't no idea where I got
this from other like one day it just
magically appeared inside removal bag I
do actually have this I brush which is a
morphe brush this is actually where my
favorite morphe eyes shadow brushes in
fact multi as a brand is actually such
an amazing brush brand overall so I do
use a lot of their brushes this is what
my face I have no idea exactly what
number it is books doesn't say on the
brush but if I can find it then I will
leave it down below and then I also do
have another brush that is very similar
in sizing buy it she uses for highlight
I don't really know if it's meant for
highlight values if I highlight and this
brush is buy it back stage again it
doesn't have a number but yeah I use a
saw highlight because you can exactly
use a beauty blender for highlight at
least I would never tried using it for
highlight before the final thing inside
my makeup bag is this brush which is my
favorite
brush of all-time and this is e is for
morphe brush this is the best contour
brush you will ever ever ever use there
