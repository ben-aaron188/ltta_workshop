hi everyone and welcome back to my
channel or now I hope you guys are
having a good day so far now for this
video
honestly I couldn't be more excited
because I'm only going to be speaking to
you guys like I'm a little bit nervous
for this as well because and then it's
going to be strange but it's going to be
really really cool so over my Twitter
they actually tweeted saying guys please
give me your numbers if you want to be
part of a video now little do you guys
know that you're actually going to be
facetiming me for this video today I'm
going to be facetiming my viewers and
honestly I couldn't be more excited I
know this might sound like a little bit
cranky or whatever but you guys
genuinely mean so much to me and
interacting with you guys is like the
best feeling ever because I would be
doing what I'm doing without all of you
guys that are watching this video that
would be my phone without you guys
watching my videos every single day so
this video to me actually means so much
and that's why I'm so excited so yeah if
you want to be a part of this video next
time and they make sure you guys follow
my Twitter so that you guys can
hopefully be a part of another video
like this I do want to do a prank call
in viewer video
and you guys seem to flip and love that
so it's kind of going to be similar to
that however I'm going to FaceTime
people off my Mac screen and by the way
this video like it doesn't always be
seen like here but it's so much hard
work that to make a fake email a fake
Apple ID and like it's just it's taken
all day but finally I've got around to
it I'm very excited so hope you guys
