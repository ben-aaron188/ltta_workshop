everyone and welcome back to my channel
and I hope you guys are having a lovely
day so far and super heavy right now and
I have no idea why is that yeah
basically today I'm going to be showing
you is this like natural makeup look
it's so so easy I try to use as many
transfer products as it could tell it
wasn't very affordable for you guys
just knowing that I'm not a makeup
artist at all but this is what I would
do if I was doing a very natural makeup
look so and you wanna enjoy these much a
big thumbs up if you guys do there try
and get to 40,000 lights and if we do
that I will know in the future that I
should do more videos like this guys
down below if you guys haven't already
and let's get into this video so
obviously as you can tell I look very
bronze right now I actually had a time
yesterday
I'm just looking very very very Brown so
like you try and use like a lighter
foundation and at the moment it will
kind of look a little bit and I thought
she always does like the first day what
I do let go once I have makeup on but
yes and like a bronze gotta not really a
bronze goddess or - actually this looks
like a little bit party and whatever
else and that's very bronze right now so
that is one because I actually have it
Han so we're going to opera foundation
and I'm going to use in it the keep our
3d lifting foundation this foundation is
so I love it foundations so so much but
I wouldn't really recommend it to
anybody that has oily skin because it is
more like a watery foundation however if
you like normal or like dry skin then
you will definitely get all of this
foundation so I'm going to super
affordable as well when I throw it as
well is actually the sale so I was like
getting my dad and I think it was like
seven pounds or something you can be
applying it with my Beauty Blender
so much as I said I don't want to be
paying too much on the most Gaby it
looks like I add a lot of my skin but
once I blend this all in it won't be a
lot and Richard is shooting one drop of
this foundation and just blending it in
with my skin
as you can see this foundation so nice
because it lends so easily and it isn't
too much which is why I love it and now
I've done it both my teeth and just get
a price down for my forehead and the
lender and as you love the foundation
why do I not use it our market so nice I
didn't see it while I have been little
bit lighter than my skin right now so
once it's completely blended in wallet
really nice and really natural so I'm
now applied the foundation just to make
sure it's blended in I'm just using a
massive blending brushes to blend it in
because obviously we want it to look as
natural as possible so we don't want any
like cartoonists or anything like that
so I'm just blending it into my neck and
everywhere on my face that is my
foundation done I honestly don't think
of goes on it to my I feel like every
time I do makeup we can always ever get
to my eye on it to my nose the nose is
yet to come
yeah here is my foundation done I
thought you wouldn't never even know
that I even have foundation on because
it's so minimal now I'm going to go in
there it is desi it with the nose yes I
feel like no makeup makeup look
concealer is very important because you
want your skin to look healthy and glowy
and very natural and with concealer this
is basically how you highlight the skin
so I feel like this is what makes a huge
huge difference and again like you can
explain this with the Beauty Vendrell or
you can use your fingers or Eddie to a
brush that you feel like you want to
blend in with I think I'm just going to
blend it in my Beauty Blender again
because it's just so easy so I'm just
applying a little bit under my eye to
get rid of the circles on a holiday like
a triangle face just to make it even
shape that's what I'm supposed a shape a
drive your shape and again I would do a
triangle shape on the other side as well
they don't really have to be even there
we go there we go and then I downloaded
on the chin a little bit above my
Cupid's bow end of
nose nose of them if all the difference
to me and then I'm going to play a
little bit on my forehead as well
I normally always like and get a spoolie
and brush my eyebrows into place and
today Hubbard so even I have very
minimal of eyebrows right now because I
actually got them done literally
yesterday mind I grow quite quickly of
what I've got so I get quite a lot of
taken off and then I was in two days ago
back right now they just look like
mannequin all over play so I have a
brush them
so yeah just excuse that okay so I'm
just going in my be slender and I am
blending in everywhere that I put my
concealer and this should make my skin
look a lot more glowy and a bit more
highlighted when I apply make a boy's
skin like holder fires plate like faces
every person that gives me a powerful
that they terminate that you know
especially put on mascara the face by
pol I feel sorry for the people like
from emptying the scar in public
restorative people that have to sit
there and watch me up for these faces
you know not a little demo dressed up
okay that is my concealer done as I like
my skin there's a lot more highlighted
now so again I'm just going to go in
with my big powder brush and once I've
done that of course I'm gonna go in with
this is the Clinique chubby stick I used
to live by this are you think it is
every single day and I think I
definitely should start using it more
again because it it's amazing and I need
is quite affordable for you get as well
considering I've used it for about a
year it can be about easier for it to
run out this is a minute alone with
forced one I've got a lot of these cuz
my arm and I ended up sharing it W ends
up growing faster so these are about my
fourth one and one now but this is great
if I can it's obviously really easy to
continue your skin waited and so easy to
get the right angles and the right
points and also it's very buildable as
well it can be a very local
or you can keep supplying it and it can
become a very high card for it's about
it looking like thick and clumpy but
obviously this is a very like natural
makeup look so I'm only just going to
apply the littlest bit and so you know
it just makes a little bit more snapped
one condition apply some on my cheekbone
most your line and then just the side of
both my forehead but now I'm going to go
over I'm going to go over it's just so
so easy to apply it and your way you are
a guide for them I don't know why Ella
stop to using it I just like trying out
different products all the time on my
skin maybe with you guys to tell you
guys like which foot up like and stop at
that so I'm always trying new products
and that's kind of why I stopped using
it but I definitely always though using
it again in my everyday makeup working
in Brooklyn
it does actually what magic is really
really good and for this is where I'm
served you like circular motions just so
it blends nicer again and battle with
the tired of us just going to make sure
it looks or less than it and for this
part of life in case you are wondering
you see morphe in one blush it really
good it's super super big low so guys if
this is you look so far I'm now going to
go in with blush focus oh boy everybody
has a natural pinky toned to their face
so follow some people don't really use
black she doesn't really look as natural
as like when you plot apply a little bit
of blush to your skin in its more
natural because we all naturally have
like a pinky kind of tone on our cheeks
what I do anyway have a look a lot of
people do so I'm going to go with the
bourgeois Paris blush this is in this
shade just that rose this is that be a
really pretty blush as well so I'm gonna
get it in the brush brush right but I've
got pins and needles I do this every
time I go make your video so I'm just
gonna get a little bit of this blush on
my crush make sure I have a lot too much
we're black as well I thought if
definitely something use is better like
a building so they look too much on it
in one go so I'm just going to quite a
little bit on my cheekbone and then kind
of just build up my cheek a little bit
and so for highlight I'm going with the
CR I don't know you pronounce right I do
get CR k but it is this little six brush
this is the typical do be stick below
and it gives a highlighting stick I
haven't used it before and I do think it
works very well again three natural
highlights Logan really like it and I'd
like with highlight as well this was
very like gulabi it makes your skin that
more like it's doesn't give you that
like popping a bit but it's very like
loving which I do is very natural and
pretty so this was really well so I'm
just going to kind of apply it where
I've naturally got that highlight anyway
on it like the top of my cheekbones I'm
just kind of blend it in with my fingers
and then also I'm just going to apply
some on my chin
this bee preserve my nose I love
applying some and the bottom my nose
because it kind of like gives you that
aspect with your nose kind of lighten
this up a little bit well that's like
the nose that I love I love know what I
called and I just leave so close now my
favorite I think they're so cute that's
kind of the effect that it gives you
then I was applied time on my forehead
as well obviously because this is like a
to me kind of stick you don't really
want to apply too much because you end
up to sitting in orbit oily so just
apply a little bit and then just kind of
like going for your fingers and just
like Pat it down so here's minute so far
this is everything for like my face but
this will the face makeup we're now
going to go in with the eyes and the
eyebrows so I'm going to top with my
brow
Tyra I'm going to be using at the sleek
eyebrow kit this is my favorite eyebrow
kit are these pretty much of all time
stood in the shade like eight seventeen
and I just got like a little spoolie and
I'm just gonna brush my brows into place
as you can try I don't really have that
much brows and converis I think I should
make them look quite big and so all of
that obviously
that's I'm literally just going to be
using the powers out for this look and
you're spilling it in a little bit
because I don't want it to be too much
you know what it to look as natural as
possible selectively or I'm going to go
for this is just following the brahmana
already have and just kind of filling it
in
I mean it's not really not necessarily
doing for their slit she just is so easy
one doing just filling in my eyebrows
are so light and only we get in tinted I
haven't got the hinges for a long while
so they look really fat right now daddy
in town already just by filling it in I
just put a little bit of powder on it is
following where my hairs all do our
place like on my brow you can see like
already It's Made start to difference
when you compare the two and if I was
like having a photo taken on me right
now those you won't even notice but you
probably just think that I just come at
my most intently you probably need to
notice oh it's brush you won't really
notice that I have like any powder on my
brow right now and just get my spoon and
proxy on my second eyebrow into place
and then yeah pretty much the same thing
just get in my little brush at this is a
flat brow brush in the number be one and
this is by Mullen
so I'm now put in and my brows I think
you can probably tell like it does
actually make such a difference they
just look a little bit more full a lot
less fat than they originally did day I
kind of just followed in that
my house and then might look a little
bit like odd shape but this is an Astra
shake my brow and I really don't want to
really draw and want to make them look
graceful because also it's going to look
bright a weird if I'm not applying that
much eye makeup in my humble alloted and
if you just give me applying mascara so
this is my brow routine most very
natural brow routine and now I think it
going with mascara I kind of put to meet
up a little bit because normally you
guys see me use the maybe in cat eye
mascara but if I were you
way too much so I'm going to go in with
the Maybelline New York the scars this
says the leather black Cavalia mix
spread mascara and this is actually
really really really good but if the
star is lured like a stick a brush so
just make your eyelashes look very slow
I'm not going to sign with any liner but
if you don't your eyelashes to look a
little bit more full why I do is just
apply a little bit of eyeliner just
literally at the bottom of your eyes
because then it doesn't really look like
you've got eyeliner on and also it does
make you look a little bit stiffer so
that is another option if you do want
your eyelashes look a little bit more
false we don't have very low urges final
thing I'm going to be using on my face
so this is the Maybelline Baby Lips over
30 creamy
caramels just free pretty because they
look very much like pink undertone
because I was debating whether you'd
like typically gloss but this is so much
nicer because it life is lost that was a
very very very pink undertone to it
my innominate makeup makeup routine is
complete i'm just going to apply some
fix and spray obviously this is not
necessary needed it doesn't make that
much of a difference
apart from a loss make sure legs are
some day so we still apply some of it
because i do so today the fiber can't
not now guys so what we've got is
dropped it okay thank goodness that is
that do you know what the amount of
times I've dropped that and it stay
alive
well I love that stuff so guys that is
the end of the video this was made no
makeup makeup look even though I did
apply it a lot of makeup people don't
have to know it guys I think what we
said at the start of this video this is
great for school if you don't apply too
much makeup and to go if it really don't
take me a long time because all the
really applying that and doing that much
it was so easy and really taking very
long that is the end of the video
subscribe if you have already avoided
that that suppose you're going to do
that because I'm watching you and comic
post notifications as well which is a
little Belgium mask you'll get notified
every single time that I upload but yes
I'm going another movie now guys and
hopefully how are you all very very soon
ma bye
