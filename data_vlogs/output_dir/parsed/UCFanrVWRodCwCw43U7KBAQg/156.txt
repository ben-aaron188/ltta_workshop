hey welcome back to my channel now as
you can see I am in different background
kind of odd switch things up this week
I'm currently sitting in my conservatory
it was going in circles you're seeing my
bedroom wall I think a third thing
because I wasn't really getting a very
solid chain she's dancing around in my
facility right now
so for this video I actually do one
which I'm pretty excited about so
somebody asked me this question on one
of my live streams over on my Instagram
I thought you know what I'm going to
take that it's such a good video idea
because I used to play this game so much
all of my friends in high school and it
just starts a classic game that
everybody knows and it is not marry or
avoid now if you just want to clarify
these people if I say I want to solve
them marry them or avoid them
it doesn't genuinely mean a woman of
wisdom in life it doesn't generally mean
I want to stop them and it doesn't mean
and what a miser visit if I have to so
it's going to be between rename if I had
to do this
these were whom I would choose although
you might actually chosen in for me over
on my Twitter I'd tweet you know so you
guys are just tagging I just I give me
three different names and I didn't
actually want to choose because I felt
like it'd be more of a challenge to me
and Tyler for me like a hardest decision
to make so my brother Kate the active
pre-screens then and he taught us and
all the ones that I'm going to be doing
on the camera right now so I don't even
know the names that you guys have asked
me I've looked at a couple but I don't
know in some cases pre-screened and I
promised him I would also do every
single one from tree to grandma's gonna
scroll up off my camera roll and give it
a go let's go down below if you guys
haven't already and let's get into this
video right the first question the first
three names Bobby Lee are Shawn Mendes
Justin Bieber or drain okay I saw was a
lot of Drake fans were going to hate on
me because of it I am love Drake so much
and all of his songs have been to his
concert
I love him I think his music is great
relationship why is it everybody think
it's gonna work so they go with a voice
Drake marry Justin and I think I was
smoked Shawn Mendes very like Shawn
Mendes I have seen many before as well
which is a really weird story
follow my fucking channel you would know
that two men in the hot tub
it's almost Rory so we don't follow my
fucking channel then go over and check
it out where'd it go for our shows that
company or Alfie deyes
again I was getting only from Zoe and it
oh they're so in love so obvious I took
me out the question but I will be
watching this right now please don't be
offended it's nothing against you it's
just because they love Zoe I love you
too much perfect
yeah it's like you guys go on together
now I'm going to avoid Albie so Joel
cast a snog ordinary don't even know
Mary Casper and some jobs because I feel
like I mean I really know their stuff
well they're literally no cast for that
well but I know Casper more than I know
Joe and I both like he is so so I've got
a bit of work so finally not gonna lie
this one's a girl whole question I think
I'm very happy though because I do think
his humor is so I think he's thrown an
area so we go I'm Mary Casper and I
probably snob Joan yes yes Victoria are
Cameron dalas always get told that I say
anything wrong so I'm so sorry
I think it's Cameron Cameron done so I'm
going to be the opposite one now that's
great or Jacob satorious now as Michael
I do think Jacob seems so lovely I know
so many people that know him as things
we love these kids
appllo life is way too young for me I
would avoid later I think I would marry
Cameron and I was smoking enough because
Cameron I feel like will be get on so
well he seems like a lot of fun and so I
would get all ready well so Cameron I
will be married and then I was snob
master a master is eyes are like the one
dylan sprouse cole sprouse or brooklyn
better definitely married Brooklyn I
think he is absolutely gorgeous and also
Victoria toughie I know
Marcus Marilyn but Victoria I think is
so beautiful as well and like I love her
fashion sense I live for her fashion and
her style
so Brooklyn I would marry you also my
mom absolutely love Victoria's fashion
sense as well and her style so I know my
mom would definitely approve I know this
is so bad I actually completely forgot
what one looks like what
so I'm actually good when this right now
dylan and Cole Sprouse whole we did if I
want to be here this is such a throwback
yeah dinner get it away from my side
just found out which one he is even when
it was suite life on deck and there was
the Suite Life of Zack & Cody
Dylan has always been my ultimate crash
so then I have a snog as coal I would
avoid this one is so hard don't go I I
think they are all absolutely incredible
not and I think you guys know this
I generally think one of them incredible
it is Nate Garner grace and government
or Ethan Dolan and this kind of breaks
my heart having to choose one it's
really hard as well because if I knew
one is that if I knew their
personalities more then it'll be so much
easier but because I do really know any
of them the only person I've kind of
ever spoken to or speak to is Nate so
like as high as my news personality ever
like great some of these and I've never
met them but I think they're all very
beautiful so this is a hard one
actually I'm excited right I'll go be
completely honest it did have it avoid
even though I do actually think he's
drop-dead gorgeous great for the Nate I
don't know which one I was married cuz I
just I mean quite happily my husband
Nate wasn't I kind of like I think he's
great I think he starts to love a person
and also he travels a lot which I would
love because or what I want to do in
life is travel the world like I
absolutely love traveling it's my
favorite thing ever to do but and
Grayson - Grayson I feel I'm actually
going to marry one of them ultimate so
just uh Michael actually choosing I'm
going to marry yet and we'll go
I smoked either of them I think I was
married do you want to guys we still
supposed and which one we didn't want
that I married the one I think I was
marinade and I was smoke greater yeah
that's what final decision that was
always like mid would die that was like
a whole fishes there guys
oh god what actually surprised the news
was getting him up and I did notice my
brother Katie would add some decisis in
here for me but I promised them I would
I won't be on it and I would reply to
everything go on Saturday delivery is
Jake Mitchell Jack main heart or Harvey
I would avoid Jake's been that much
Kentucky work I was I think I would snog
Jack and I would marry Harvey because I
feel like I know Harvey better and we
get on really well as like friends I
just think married hardly would be a
safe bet because yeah we just go on so
well if I had to
that is what I would do Donald Trump
Hitler or Kate Hopkins bear in mind I
don't like any of these three like after
I could really go to green I just don't
agree with them and I wouldn't want to
be friends many things but if I had to
choose now I was definitely throw Hitler
out the equation I would definitely
avoid Hitler broken I know yeah he done
that he discussed he's my kid I just
think he's a vital human being I
wouldn't marry Donald Trump and the
reason why is because guys I want to
save the world I don't know like you
might marry Donald Trump if he was so in
love with me I could you know change his
might I've been telling you don't want
to be President you don't want to make
these traces you don't want to do that
yeah that's me stop from Welker
save the world you don't want to make
that walk you don't want to kick every
other country and finally you don't
maybe taking post towns and fields
anymore
bang some vodka change Donald Trump she
saves the world
hallelujah
okay this is getting a little bit weird
let's move on the next one is Elliot
Crawford
Joella or cow freebie now I know who I
would avoid as I don't actually know cow
the cow and research how you're feeling
Maya how you feeling - Tori probably
could care less but I would appoint you
because I don't actually know you even
though you might prepped another person
I would have to avoid you in the
direction of Elia and Joe so Mary more
looking any awesome drummer okay well I
have actually quite frankly I brought
them both Sena I was not gonna lie I
think I think Elliot's the best so
that's my joke so I was joking by the
way I would I don't know I didn't for
some of these people I think they were
probably I didn't know probably Mary at
math Maria Mary Elliot and soldier me he
makes one chaos I colors or road-roller
well apparently I'm too young for chaos
I so I'm going to avoid him because he's
already avoided me in his video wait oh
my god she's forgetting yeah okay so I
would not delay I would I would take
your hand and then after that can
exercise the copying and avoid me -
you're 24 I can all be like 39 jesus so
you know I did good
I would not color the showing what he's
missing out on then I would avoid him I
would avoid care side and then Oh Mary
Roka sha-boom learning to Marzia
previously Oh
my life come on helping no Selena Gomez
our mo conde or Demi Lovato now I just
want to I have so much love for Selena
and Ariana like I am upset with them
both I don't really listen to Denny's
music that much so I think I would avoid
any even though I do think she's going
in this and everything else I just I
would avoid isolating from really bitter
music
Selena I listen to literally non-stop I
am give I think I will compete if I was
to know about them as a person I think I
would get all of Selena's better so I
think I was married Lena and I thought I
