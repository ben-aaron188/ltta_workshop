hey guys and welcome back to my channel
now for today's video as you compose
likely see in the title today I'm dyeing
my hair now if you do follow my social
media you would have seen that I
actually tweeted out saying if I get
over 4 thousand retweets that I would
dye my hair pink already it got it got
more than four thousand retweets so
thankfully I've actually teamed up with
L'Oreal on this video and now you go to
be sent me all of their color Easter
grains they said we don't wash you wash
out one and also they've sent me their
spray in last day and then this one
lasts up to a week kind of depending on
your hair type
but apparently two to three washes so no
no a line I got a little bit nervous
because I've never really gone any other
color apart from well my natural hairs
like brown but never really gone any
other color pop and blonde so I'm super
nervous for this but I've always wanted
to dye my hair pink so the kind of that
I use on my hair every wondering it's
literally just called pink hair and this
is what it looks like now the cool thing
about these as well as it does actually
say on the back depending on what hair
color you are and what hair type what
dial actually super hair not on the back
of this baby pink one it says if you
have brunette hair this is less likely
to show up on your hair so I'm gonna
give this a go I'm going to use the baby
pink color so let's do this I also
probably get into this video smash alike
for good luck okay right let's welcome
to my bathroom I'm sure you guys do my
bathroom like plenty times but hey ho
anyways moving on I've actually got my
wash and wash out hair dye I'm also
going to grab a towel because it's
really important to have a towel so that
you don't ruin your clothes you don't
just wanna bring your clothes just from
dyeing your hair if you're gonna tell
that's not good happen so I've got my
power also gonna be using some gloves as
well which is inside the packet which is
also handy so let's do those those
eyelids
okay right let's actually do this need
to work on my gloves as well right wax
on my gloves I'm never dying my hair
before it goes and I'm just going to
pull out half my hair up just to get it
literally just out the way and there are
two the last bits after it is my hair oh
by the way also I had to change towels
because the other one was too small it
wouldn't cover all my hair so this tells
look we're big but we may do this right
laughs I want to say just quickly before
I do get into actually putting the dry
on my hair I did actually patch test
this 48 hours beforehand let's work this
song oh we're good such a dot you know
it's making it to come out light like
pink go way too much of my can't so I'm
just gonna like run it through with this
hands I'm just going to like place it
and then I'm gonna kind of just like run
it through because I kind of want it
like highlighted pink I don't want the
entire thing pink I'm so excited
also when I do for the top part of my
hair as well I'm not going to go
completely to the end of my roots as I
do still want like someone showing as I
do want it to be like highlighted oh God
well I got flybro too much and up there
so good fondant so far you don't never
have applied of that and I just start
flying some more bargain is the
difference always thinking that sighs
okay guys if you've dyed your hair a lot
you probably think you like a saffron
what you doing white getting so nervous
like ye something like you know to like
one week washy and wash out but I just
I've never done this before I mean I'm
so excited for the end result I know
that L'Oreal go do me good far andrás
I'm so done with this I literally cannot
believe how easy this is
but I thought this is good it no I just
ah be so difficult like I could
definitely get used to this if it turns
out well I'm really hoping so okay
that's that's all I'm going to do on the
bottom right I'm going to take my glove
off and just hate on the rest of my hair
good okay right now we can do the top
half I feel like I've done it quite even
it's really easy to be honest so if you
two doesn't work out for me am I going
to the hairdressing
process is good to know a hairdressing
colorist I fine oh my guess if anybody
wants me to dye their hair I'm enjoying
it so much I will happily
dye your hair for you so give it like
comment down below your pieces remember
your way to do your hair color
why I'm saying that yeah I'm saying that
now though but I don't know what it's
going to turn I know I do think I would
generally love this I kind of like just
run it through the back of my hair I
think is kind of even pretty much
everywhere by very big about as if it
isn't I even focus just highlights so
I'm going to take all of my bulbs I need
to part of 15 to 20 minutes timer I'm
gonna set right a whack in the middle 17
minutes but it should be searching the
half for sodium with it right 17 years
been at 17 minutes my time is done I'm
now going to rinse off what is on my
hair so I say okay let's reset all c'mon
China for me length leaning over the
bath 2 rinses off but here we go
right I would usually get in the shower
but I feel like y'all really want to see
me in shower so welcome to nap also
going to have a portable like shower

would be enough monies and wine so he
goes by pending over breaking her back

even more sexy you know Roy okay now
I've got a blow dryer and make it like
it what three to work whoa here it is
and I actually love it so so so so much
this is the back transformation kind of
I want to get pink hair permanent now
but other though I love it so so much
I'm so so happy with it and yeah I mean
let me go jumbo you guys think of the
color I'm now actually I kind of regret
being such a baby and not going doing
like my full hair so just because I love
it so much and I haven't belonged to my
roots and I kind of regret it I'm just
going to do one of the spraying so they
actually sent to me because there's
having so many different colors and even
though I've never really wanted to go
hot hot pink I feel like it could kind
of look cool with this hairstyle and if
it doesn't it's a spray-on one so I can
literally just wash it out so I'm gonna
grab my towel again and then just frames
in my hair just literally for you guys
you guys can see what the sprays
actually look like and how they work I
mean I'm pretty excited even more
nervous but again I can just wash this
out but this will last me quite a while
so I'm sure you'll see like going on my
Instagram Stephanie my pink hair I'm
