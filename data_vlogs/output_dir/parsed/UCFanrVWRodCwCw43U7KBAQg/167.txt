hey everyone welcome back to my channel
also hope you all are having a lovely
day so far so for today's video
oh yes I am back with another hole know
you guys know me full of my daily blog
and channel you guys all know I am a
Shopaholic
so I have been shopping I have bought
more clothes and today's try on haul is
actually called an Instagram baddie try
on whole nother reason I've actually
decided to call this drawn clothing haul
that how it's a big big mouthful
recently over on my Instagram I hope we
get our like floods and floods and
floods of comments asking where my
clothes are from so just be easier to
put it in a hole and I've been shopping
today's there not absolutely everything
I've worn over on my Instagram there are
some new bits but I feel like recently
my style has changed up like a little
bit I just feel like the startup
clothing that I've been wearing meets it
needs it otherwise rock chest and a
little bit more like on trend I just
thought that one in a video for you guys
because I've been getting so many
compliments about myself piloting that
I've been wearing recently so just
thought it's better to put it in a video
if you don't form an Instagram then you
can follow it right there or is actually
link down below as always as well as
everything I'm going to be showing you
today if I can find it that will also be
linked down below for you guys as well
also by the way my eyes have been really
watery for like the past two days I'm
not like entirely sure why I kind of
need to get the mic checked out I've
recently just got glasses
follow it in box you will know that so
you should follow my daily vlogs if you
don't sell promo I know but you know
it's down below but oh yeah they've been
really watery not be tiny shot why so
apologies if I just have really watery
eyes so we can actually get on with the
video now so let's do this guys the
first start from H&M this is this gray
like Jersey style crop top I have been a
loving wearing this recently I've worn
it quite a lot
partly because not only do I think it
looks really cool it's also so
comfortable like it's the most coffee
material ever and I freaking love
wearing comfy clothes it's like an over
well I think it's oversized because I
got it over sites like it's in a size
large so it's like an over
crop top and it has like rich down the
sides isn't the short sleeves crop top
but it has like ripped here like rips
both sides of the arm awesome I love the
zip going down the back I just think it
makes it look that a little bit more
like 20 you know yeah I just kind of
love like the faded gray and I love how
it's like cut at the bottom as well I
love like it's kind of like a
rough-looking cut so yeah next up you
may have seen me wear this in a video
before and this is this Thrasher tee
knows only like a classic fashio t-shirt
these I think are so like in at the
moment now I know there's gonna be so
many comments like someone you don't
even skate but I like the top so I
wanted to get it anyway it's just like a
basic thrash a t-shirt I was so
surprised on how hard hard to get hold
of there was so many faiths on the
internet and it took me so long to try
and find one I honestly thought was real
so I'm hoping this isn't fake I mean it
has like a thrush a label and all stuff
like that so I believe it Israel it was
really really pricey though like sixty
something pounds I believe I'm going to
leave the website down below I've got it
in a size medium because again I just
wanted it to be like oversized it's like
a skateboard t-shirt I feel like you
know it's better to be exercise so I
love this t-shirt I mean it's kind of
just plain she's a basic thrash of
t-shirt but I'm glad I actually got my
hands on one next up from River Island
is this white choker style top now I
have already similar in black which on
my Instagram cost 100,000 times was from
it's from River Island this one's so
similar I've been debating whether to
get the white one for such a long time
but because I'm so bad I get let's just
say a very clumsy and messy person and
for me like makeup would just go on a
white top so I still like five times in
the shop and every time I've been like
debating whether to get it or not and I
just thought I'm going to get it so
loved it so much and I feel like on
holiday
something over where that when I have
more rattan and I'll be wearing less
makeup and it won't get makeup on the
t-shirt so it's like a split t-shirt has
two different designs each side which I
think that's really cool and I love and
obviously chokers are sewing at the
moment so this job I think is kind of
great because it's like a choker in a
top and I love as a v-neck up this top
as well so overall I think this top is a
really cool top
it's 22 pounds and I put it in a
slightly again size a is quite oversized
just how I like it
guys I don't know if you can hear this
right now kind of open you don't kind of
hoping you up cuz I'm lying vomiting
about it right now
right there is this man I think he's
just like moved near us I hope not
is never started rubbing in his life
until now and he is drumming so loud
right now like banging out his tunes I
thought I was going mental last night I
was laying in bed and it was like home
Vanessa Natalie Drummond and I'm
thinking I'm going to say that nobody's
drumming this loud at night
clearly not this man that what I
generally think we got to go around
there and ask him to be quiet like he's
so loud no they could do that surely you
can hear that but this wife in here in
no time
Harmon Evan and I boys go mental I just
thought like why can I hear drums I
wasn't doing are you actually for real
anyway just ignore that then anything I
picked up this was from Topshop is the
idol yttrium in love with this so this
is like a palm-tree bodysuit it has gold
writing on which I think that's so cool
with the palm trees we all know thing I
love love love anything gold so I love
this I just think it's just got that
holiday vibes like I'm going away to
Egypt in March which I will be rubbing
for you guys and I know I for sure will
be wearing this because it's just got
holiday vibes regime' over and that is
so cool as well with like the gold
writing and
I actually got in the sale luckily so
it's originally nineteen pounds actually
got it in a sale for five pounds
how about blooming amazing is that for
five powers like yes I love it thank you
so much Topshop for that ballgame
obviously I haven't actually won this on
my Instagram yet but guys the following
I for sure you're going to see your own
this very soon I feel like a lot of you
guys are going to know where these from
for these have been my obsession
recently these are these checkered bands
I've been wearing these pretty much
every single day every Instagram post
are wearing these I just think they're
so cool and they are so comfortable I
mean they just slip on shoes I mean
they're just the comfiest things really
weird though my mum and dad used to have
these like 25 years back which makes
them some really old no yeah I just
honestly think they're so cool and I
just love them so much they were so hard
to get hold of though because actually
in the band saw they don't actually sell
them anymore they're going to bring them
back in the summer and I went pretty
much everywhere like office shoe it
didn't have them I managed to get them
from offspring so you're looking try
offspring but yeah I love them so much
and I think I'm like 45 pounds I bet - I
have no idea that was just such a guys
but yeah i link it down below for you
guys so this is another bargain from
Topshop because I've got it in the sale
again I go to the sale for 10 pounds but
I don't actually know the original price
because it doesn't say on your label so
this is a Black Sabbath t-shirt now I'm
not really into rock bands and heavy
metal that's not really me but I'm
really really really into rock band
heavy metal clothing just forgot like
they they look really cool so this lack
Sabbath t-shirt I just think really cool
they're leather tassels down the side
and I can just imagine myself wearing
with some holiday already like a pair of
in a hot country obviously because like
it's sleeveless and it's like a bear top
as well so yeah this is something I
could just easily Chuck on and I love
Nordy short you guys can actually get
hold of this hopefully you can but I
began our so many times on Instagram
where is this from and this is actually
this Ralph Lauren crop top so it's like
a veggie kind of creamy nudie color but
then it has like the gray neck it's
actually made by we are counting so I
got in from Topshop but it was actually
like in the vintage section like there
was only one of these and so I'm not
really sure on how like easier they are
to get hold off because in a vintage
range like you can't even take these
back once you've bought it so I don't
know they just sell one of each I
believe they do yeah I love this and I
thought it was really good price as well
considering it was like Ralph Lauren and
it was I think it was 28 pounds I
thought it was actually really good for
the money and again I know I will wear
this a lot why would you have one in a
lot so yeah next up are these ripped
very very rich money jeans from River
Island they are practically ripped the
entire leg way down and they're like
super skinny I find they're really
really comfortable and there are not
more ripped than I previously been
wearing I've been wearing these a lot
just because they're so comfy and I
think they're really cool obviously
black jeans both everything nor even
more to say about these but I wear these
quite a lot ripped jeans River Island
they do the best next up more close to
River Island I got this pale pink light
hoody no I actually love this because
it's so thin and what it hangs it's like
really flattering and like it's one of
those jumpers that you can like put
jackets over the top you know sometimes
like when you wear a jumper and it's so
thick that like you put a jacket on it
just like it will scrunches up and it's
like you know just yeah you know what I
mean so it's like a really really thin
like a pale pink jumper I love how
you're pink I love the color of this
which like drew my attention to it
straight away is really dissipating
jumper
everybody's gonna help
those in their wardrobe is very
oversized and by the way it actually is
the softest thing inside like in so so
comfy dinner jacket from River Island
there's a sitting love I love how many
rips it's got its got like rips like on
the back from pretty much everywhere so
I think it's like quite edgy quite cool
and I really like it it also has like
the phrase bottom which I think's really
nice as well they're very - I like is
too neat of brain bottom like I want it
to be more scruffy so I might just like
you know pick it out and play with it in
orbit so the bottoms more like afraid
cuz it's too neat you know I want it to
be a bit more edgy it's already
oversized but it's big enough to were
like over like hoodies and stuff so like
that pink on one example you could
easily just wear that on top so Red Hot
Chili Peppers again I'm not really like
a fan like I don't really listen to them
like all the time however love this top
so gotta buy anyway and to be fair I do
actually know a couple songs so this is
this like a dudes looking Navy greyish
color how many of you guys have an ask
for where it's from but I don't really
think that many of you guys actually
seen the back which is the best part
unless you do follow the daily looks I
thought was so so weird right the back
so it's really oversized to be honest is
practically like backless so then it has
like rips like drew was it kind of like
hang I don't really know how to say in
this it's not really ripped because
there's practically no back but yeah I
just thought it's really cool I think
that's really good with like a leather
jacket just kind of like rock it out
finally guys for laughing I'm going to
talk about its a jump with I'm actually
wearing right now now they don't really
like edgy and full on out there this is
more like on the cute side of it but I
posted this on it's posted a picture of
myself wearing this from Instagram and
you guys went mental
Porat like God's voice frog so it's
actually compliment there it was 25
pounds and the reason I love this is
because the starters it doesn't have
like a waist band at the bottom so again
like is a really thin jumper and it
hangs really
thusly it's really flattering again is
so soft inside and I've caused a health
Mickey Mouse in the front and I loved
his knee and on the back the best part
hugged me like I generally think if I
saw somebody wear this jumper and it's
all the hopefully on the back I
genuinely think I would go to the manag
them because it's so adorable and I love
it so yeah this jumper I love especially
because I've been looking like a red
jumper recently these hunters call my
eye so there's a hat to include it was
so cute so yeah hope you guys see me
walking in the street at this jumper
when you want to give me a hug
go for it like just go for it but yeah
