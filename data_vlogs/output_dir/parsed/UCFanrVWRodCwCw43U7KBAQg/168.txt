without further adieu
I've already rambled on so let's get
into this video okay so this is like
really putting out that and asking me
when did you start your period when did
I start my period I think it was year a
year right right and basically I was I
proper scare when I started my period so
I tell my mom like please mom please
don't tell anyone she's like no no no I
swear she walked into the next room and
told my dad to minutes later let's go
dad how much of dad knowing when you
just started your period oh no my mom
was great at keeping the promise so I
think it was like beginning of year
right and my mom could not keep her
mouth shut about it in fact she was
excited about it that I think she told
everybody she knew oh yeah and not even
just that when I told her as well she's
done bursting out laughing as well I
have the most fun supportive Mama's
toffee so yeah I think I was like the
beginning of the array that's right yes
are you still with Jake or have you
broken up I really want to know the
truth no we aren't together anymore we
actually broke up like before Christmas
- what is your all-time favorite town or
city sorry I don't not the word it town
or city Turin not sitting thinking I've
no idea what though it is my favorite
Allen City Florida Tampa love it's the
best place no I love going that
genuinely think up be Florida it's a fun
have you ever thought about making out
your mom and dad's house
oh I pop me which kind of love too I
think
only because I would love to live and
redecorate and like I don't know just
having I don't know it'd be quite nice
to have my own space I've kind of always
like thought of it the back of my mind
but at the same time like I wouldn't
really want to move out on my own I
think I'd be really lonely and plus I
love my family too much or my mum my mum
and dad do so much for me so I basically
dopey I could move out if I did I'll
probably end up coming back to this
house like bringing my washing every day
and yeah probably end up living at this
house more than the house that I've
moved out into so I've kind of like
always thought about it but I don't
think it would happen for a long time
Efrain are you and Joe Ella dating I
just saw the tweet that he was dating
you so are you enjoy love dating Joe and
I are not dating
no we're just like really good friends
and I don't really know how everybody's
got this vision that we dating like I'm
not entirely sure I think it's because
when I was on the thumbnail of Joe's
video which I had no idea why I don't
even tell me about that a next minute
I'm on the thumbnail of this video I
think people might have thought because
the title was something to do if I get
in girls in 2017 and I was the thumbnail
that we're dating for no we aren't ooh
supple rumours there's like crazy amount
of videos that go in across YouTube
right now that stuff on and Joe when are
dating no we are not dating
I am a single lady Oh
we got to do it
we're here open though cuz now my name's
God but love me laughs anyway hey will
you want to go Sharada
oh I've been asked this by Joe and
Elliot themself before I never really
know what to answer because this kind I
don't know there's like different
reasons like I love Elliot he's
personality that he's just so sweet so
love me um I don't know like a Joey way
to me now
Elliot's just really lovely and nice
he's text me I've got a text I got it
thanks I got it you cannot change in
subject holder all day I don't really
want to do any of them I love them both
I love them both so much
um I've had to choose I what we don't
bow for them
yes it's hashtag sell yet and hashtag
donno and oh I'll just be YouTube video
cuz I mean why not well you are but bang
yes you are god I am of my question is
it's gotta change one thing about
yourself what would it be oh okay
there's quite a few things I think I
would change about myself first being
having a fast metabolism I am so jealous
of people that can eat whatever they
want and to put on anyway like you
seriously don't understand how annoying
it is I am so jealous to have a fast
metabolism
definitely also I hate my nose like I
generally hate it so much and I'm not
fishing for compliments for people to
start going oh you know it's nice I
really don't like my nose I've always
wanted to have a nose job
also always wanted to have a boob job so
maybe in the future I don't know if
everyone just were to ask and then we've
already better be done my new bedroom is
currently being done I'm not sure how
long I think like a couple of days give
me three days this video goes up on
Sunday so probably like Tuesday
depending how amazing my parents are on
getting it done so my dad if you'd like
to be as quick as possible
ASAP then have a fully Tuesday I was
wondering
you would ever like to release your
makeup around because I think you'd be
really good at us no makeup brand of
course that would be like the dream to
bring out my own makeup brand that would
be absolutely crazy whether or not that
happens I don't know but something along
that line maybe could happen this year
so make sure you just have your eyes
peeled
hey suffering I love your vlogs and my
Preston is do you still love Jack
secretly and if you do would you get
back with him Jake was obviously my
first love so I guess he will always
hold something in my heart but no no no
no kissing a small dead day Wow Wow I
would say I've kind of dated like three
or four people but I need like not
really all being like long terms like
actual like true love's like you know a
couple of them just being you know
people that you just dated like we're
using you're seven because you just kind
of fancied each other a little bit but
like it wasn't really anything special
so probably say like three or four
boyfriends what's your name my love you
my favorite subject filter would
definitely be the butterfly one yeah yes
yeah yeah it's the butterfly one Bahat
yeah it always disappears and it's so
annoying
so if not I probably think the one that
you just use the like you know the
Barbie one every record to see your oh
so much action action sorry sorry yeah
that's definitely not true I would never
ever ever be that like I would never go
behind somebody's back when I've loved
them for so long and go and do that and
like Jones like a good mate of mine like
I don't even know why that broom a even
started it's definitely not true it's me
Stephanie and the question is when will
you come to LA and Olivia I want you
moving I want to come to LA so bad so
I've been to LA before I went there I
went to VidCon last year and I'm really
hoping to go again maybe even sooner
than you think this year so yeah I was a
little
the key I spilled because I'm hopefully
actually going to LA very very soon to
make sure you look out and yet maybe
there will be a meet up there you never
know hi I want to know what's the worst
situation you've been sinners the worst
situation I've ever been in a garden is
like you remember the one situation a
situation that half of recently was when
I was at a festival and I had been
bursting for the toilet the whole day
and you know you have to keep like an
hour and a half like the public toilets
at the festival when I got in that hour
and a half Q a half - I've been waiting
like eight worked like hours and hours
don't even hour-long must have been like
five hours I think I just had four to
eight to five you know it was a long
time so I had to wait a long time to go
to the toilet literally gonna pee my
pants in fact it probably kind of people
my pants a little bit then gone to the
toilet peed yes best people my life yes
there's no toilet paper had to drip dry
and there was the whole day and I just
tripped ride and it was so awkward and
it was so uncomfortable for the rest of
the day and it was just such an awful
situation right so we bought - this is
pro kit too late I just wanted to ask us
YouTube film tamasha times I love you I
love you - I would say more of my daily
vlogging channel like sometimes it can't
be like quite Philon because obviously
I'm having to vlog every single day edit
that night upload the next day so
sometimes it can't be full-on
but obviously like I absolutely love it
like there are some times where I get
really really stressed and like I'm like
oh my god it's too much but that's only
because I put the pressure on myself
like it doesn't have to be like that
like when I'm trying to upload nine
videos a week like that is quite a lot
of work and I don't know that when I
pull my line up my family and stuff like
sometimes they don't want to be filmed
it's just like like sometimes look it's
a bit too much but obviously like I love
it and I wouldn't change it for the
world
so I guess like your question it can
some transfer like too much but at the
same time I love it
I would never give it up and I guess I
kind of put that pressure on myself ever
gay
Oh what I ever day of you are I guess it
kind of depends like if you're
hi I guess it kind of depends a
situation I guess I would but depending
on I don't know like say for example
like I was a crazy crazy crazy fan of
somebody then I wouldn't even expect
them to date me because if he was like
and one thing anybody would be obsessed
with me I'm not saying that at all but
I'm just saying like if I was obsessed
with somebody else if I was a crazy fan
of somebody else like I won't even
expect them to date me because it would
just be weird so it gives it kind of
depends of what vibes it is that give
it's just somebody that watches my
videos like yeah like do not I mean
that's just supportive that's nice so
yeah I think I probably would for kind
of depending on the situation so there
was guys I really hope you all enjoyed
this video I try to answer as many like
a variety of questions a lot of people
are asking the same questions and my
phone kept paying off for hours so it
was like a real hard video to film but I
