hey guys and welcome back to my channel
so I hope you guys are having an amazing
2017 so far I mean I know it's only day
one but I hope you guys are enjoying I
really really really hope that your 2017
is filled with so much positive and
happy vibes throughout so make it the
best you guys can make it make it an
amazing year I know 2017 is going to be
such a good year for me I could feel it
and I'm so freaking excited but before
me to get into 2017 I'm going to show
you what I'm going to be wearing for New
Year's Eve so I've been practicing my
makeup for ER and the look I'm just
about to show you is what I'm going to
wear and I just got a tags for real
though this is the look that I will be
wearing on New Year's Eve so I don't
know it might give you some ideas or you
might just want to see me chat away
whilst doing my makeup I don't know why
you're here watching this video right
now whatever the reason may be I hope
you guys enjoy it and just want a great
display were out there I am NOT a makeup
artist in any way shape or form this is
just how I'm going to do my makeup and
this is how I like to do my makeup so I
hope you guys enjoy if you do please
smash a big thumbs up and let's get into
this video so I'm going to start with
the Smashbox photo finish primer this is
actually my favorite primers ever I mean
it's quite pricey but it's so good it's
so of the money so I'm just gonna rub
this all around my face you know what it
is of my skin if I don't put on primer
like honesty my makeup will go so patchy
like after half an hour or something I
have to put quite a lot of primer on
because if I don't my makeup looks so
patchy honestly so I shove quite a lot
on my skin so I'm going to be mixing it
the bare mineral with liquid foundation
this is absolutely amazing but it's not
amazing if you have oily skin because it
is quite an oily foundation hence why I
mix it up where is my two-phase
foundation with my two-phase foundation
which I can't seem to find so I put some
foundation onto my Beauty Blender I'm
just gonna blend it around my face I've
mixed both of them together if you
follow my blogs you will know that I use
a lot darker shade than my skin tone
actually is there
reason being is because I love to look
tan or interesting like personally for
me I look so much better when I have a
tan and a lot of the time I do get spray
tans as well so I do use quite a dark
foundation but it works amazing for my
skin and by the time I blend it into my
neck and stuff as well like you would
even guess you would honestly just think
this is my natural skin color and just
genuinely think that I am quite tan even
though I'm not tan at all also guys what
are your new year resolutions because
honestly I actually have so many and I
was so undecided what to do it just like
as a main Channel video on its own but I
think like I've already spoken about it
in my vlogs and stuff and I just feel
like it's not really that needed I don't
have quite a lot but I just keep
changing my mind firstly being to be
healthy and fit which I set myself every
single year and it never really works
out I mean this year so far I've done
quite well a lot better than I have done
in the past few years but I honestly
believe in myself a 20-17 like I will
really get fit and I will be so like
motivated like I'm already motivated now
so I really believe in myself which is
all good and also I'm going to Egypt if
you follow my vlogs again you will know
I'm going to Egypt and that's going to
give me so much motivation to get fit as
well so that's definitely my top thing
as my new year resolution radio so now
I've actually blended in my foundation
I'm now going to go ahead and start
using my contour and concealer so I'm
going to start using the last and
perfection concealer in the shade fair
one I believe this is the lighter shade
as I don't know I just think like two
shades what it's best when you tried to
contour and yes I do use a lot and a lot
of concealer just because I think it I
don't know I really love when your skin
that's really like bright and fresh and
I feel like contouring with concealer
definitely does that so I do use quite a
lot especially under the eye I kind of
do like a triangle as you'll see so I'm
going to whack quite a lot of this on I
also put it on my chin just above my lip
my nose my forehead okay
again I do like you know the wit I mean
you would have seen a hundred thousand
people do exactly what I'm doing right
now maybe not use as much concealer but
for me it really really works and then
finally I'm just going to do another
triangle on the other side honestly guys
this concealer is literally insane it's
so affordable and it literally does the
job so well it's great a covering spots
as well it does both like it's great for
contouring with and at the same time
it's also great for covering spots which
I actually find it's really hard to find
in a concealer because they're not
concede is that I've used before don't
really do both like that either great a
covering spot or they're great at
contouring with weather this one it's so
affordable I have like five of these in
my makeup bag because I just never want
to run out and at the same time it's
great a covering spot so I'm gonna let
this soak into my skin and then once it
has soaked into my skin these absolutely
fab I got sent knees I can't member who
by now I think it was number seven I got
this sent by and they are literally
amazing they're little mini Beauty
blenders and I use this to contour with
and just to soak in my concealer and
literally they're absolutely fab for
like getting around your nose and stuff
like to the inner of your eye
they are literally amazing so I'm going
to let this soak in and I'm gonna put on
the darker shades of my contour whilst I
let that soak in and then I'll get into
actually blending in my concealer I
don't know ones that I've been pulling
around for this I don't know but yeah so
I'm actually going to be using the sleek
cream contour kit I'm going to be using
the darkest shade in the palette so I'm
going to be putting this on my
cheekbones my jawline and then above my
forehead I feel like I've gone way too
far down fit inspired I could just blend
that in and then I'll do the same the
other side right so there's my jawline
and then finally I need to do my
forehead
going back on to near resolution so so
the other ones like my other goals for
2017 as well as like staying fit and
keeping healthy is just to always have a
positive mind and always be kind to
others and also another thing as well
for me is obviously like I'm on social
media at 24
seven if you follow my social media you
definitely will know that where is my
mini Beautyblender no that's the one
annoying thing it's so tiny
I can never I always lose it oh no it's
under my fur okay I got a bug another
one is even though I'm on like social
media 24/7 because it's the way I get to
interrupt you guys I feel like I am on
it too much I feel like when I go of my
friends and my family like at the dinner
table and stuff I don't really
obviously I appreciate them but I don't
know like every year goes past so
quickly and I really want to spend less
time on my phone like I am on my phone
probably far too much like more than my
friends and I know it's because like I
speak to you guys and make it interact
with you guys and staff and obviously
I've always uploaded videos the internet
and stuff like that and my daily vlogs
but I feel like sometimes I really need
to like live the moment rather than be
on social media and I don't feel like I
do that enough I feel like sometimes I
need to have a break and actually
appreciate the people around me and
spend like quality time with them so
that's another thing I really really
want to stick to and stick by throughout
2017 I feel like that's definitely
needed so yeah but I thought that's
gonna be hard one for me though like I
really want it to work I feel like it's
gonna be a hard one okay I look quite
pale right now but as soon as I blend in
the dark shades my contour it should
look cool and I just do circle motions
as I blend it in throughout my
cheekbones and this morphe brush it's
the e4 morphe brush is amazing for
contouring I don't know what it is it's
just so easy to blend and I literally in
love with this rush I'm just gonna blend
that in oh oh if also weird because an
army like I'm always listening to music
or always watching YouTube when do my
makeup so when I have nothing on and I'm
just listening to my own voice I don't
know it feels strange drew my makeup
right now oh I forgot to say as well
guys if you randomly hear like banging
noises I don't think you can because my
dads are not banging banging right now
it didn't sound great because my
basically my dad again if you follow my
vlogs you will know that I'm actually
I'm not going to be in this Remini
I'm actually changing bedrooms it won't
look a little bit different I'm still
going to have this bed so still
recognize the backdrop with my bed but I
am changing bedrooms just because the
room next door will opposite me is
actually a lot bigger and I wanted to
have like an office and stuff in it and
I'm going to make it really cool and as
it was a spare room we just thought why
not like a maze well so I'm going to be
changing bedrooms so make sure you guys
a follow my blog so you can like see the
behind the scenes of that currently my
dad is changing the floor hence why well
not right now he's being really out but
a minute ago he was being real loud I
don't know whatever he was doing however
however you changed the floor I don't
even know so yeah that if you can hear
that noise that would be why also just
wanted to create more color to my room
because even though I love it being
white and stuff I just feel like for
like the backdrops of my youtube videos
I just want a bit more color there as
even though like I love my bed and stuff
I just feel like it's so what is white
obviously is right but I just wanted a
bit more color in it so basically when I
moved to my new bedroom
it basically means I'm going to have two
different backdrops throughout my room
it sounds kind of weird but what I'm
doing is it will go if that makes sense
but I'm like splitting the room so half
of its going to be a colorful half it's
going to be the furniture that I have
now which I know sounds really weird and
you're like okay that's going to be like
two different rooms like what are you
doing but it's not going to be like that
it will all like match up and it will
all look it will look cool and I'm
really excited for it and I haven't got
my furniture yet so I need to go to Ikea
and look on some like websites and stuff
and see what I wasn't gonna say fun I
was going to say something like a saying
that fancy my picker or something well
what why oh I don't know I was gonna say
what tick tick on my pickle is that what
is that saying
so what tickles my pickup no I don't
know I don't know what the saying is if
you know I'm on about you probably don't
have an explained it that well let me
know oh god what I've got with me today
I feel so hyper right now okay so I've
done that now I'm now going to use my
Anastasio contour kit this is in the
shade medium and I do use various shades
and
only mix these two and then I use the
darkest shade here but I'm going to
start by mixing these two I feel like
puttin powder over cream really works it
really sets it and I really think it
defines your cheekbones and stuff it
makes such a difference also the
Anastasia contour kit is fab as well
it's so so good one of my favorite
powder contour kits that I've ever tried
so again I'm just doing circular motions
and it will apply it everywhere I won't
just apply it on my cheekbones Oh again
apply it on my jawline and on my
forehead so using the darker shade of
the pallet I'm using that to put it on
my forehead as I don't know that's what
I do
so as you can tell not a makeup artist
at all this is just what I like to do
this is what works for me
so I'm going to be applying that on my
forehead I feel like I always put the
darkest shade on my forehead I just
think it makes my forehead look smaller
which is obviously got it to my nose I
always get itchy nose ever since I've
got my nose ring I've always had an
itchy nose like ever since like every
single day I like looking like I have a
sore forehead
so I put the darkest shade on my
forehead and then again I will just put
some on my jawline to sharpen that out
oh I'm also just using this huge morphe
e-1 brush to just now blend it all
around and just make sure it's all I can
blend it but no yeah every time I saw on
this bed always get pins and needles
okay so this is what I do to contour my
face so right now I'm using the Too
Faced blush this is I think it's candy
glow it's called and just putting this
on my cheekbones but not too much I I
don't know I'm going to use that quite a
light pink as I don't want too much pink
throughout this look this is the best
highlighter you will ever ever use it is
literally insane and again just like a
concealer I use a lot of highlight look
how freakin insane this highlight is
that was like what two three strokes
so again just basically putting this
everywhere that I put the concealer to
really brighten my skin and to get my
skin glowing and stand out so I put it
on my forehead I'll put some on my nose
again not too much though otherwise it
just looks stupid on my chin and then
again just above my lip that is my base
makeup done I'm now going to shove up my
hair because it's going to get in my way
whilst I do my eye makeup by the way I'm
going to find this so hard I don't think
I've ever done a makeup video like
actually doing like eyeliner or anything
called camera and I don't know if this
is going to be the first or not because
I've only just got the hang of doing
like winged eyeliner and stuff myself so
doing on camera is going to be so
freaking hard so this is a new planner
that I've been using on my eyes recently
I actually got sent this by it Mac I am
so lucky I literally was overwhelmed and
it is insane and there's two shades I
literally love which is this light pink
one here and the burgundy shade and I've
been using these colors a lot recently I
really love like warmer shades on my
eyes now and I really love with
Burgundy's and bread's as I really think
it make sure I stand out especially if
you do have blue eyes like myself or
green eyes I really feel like Burgundy's
and reds really make your eyes stand out
so I'm going to be using this palette so
this a pinky shadow that I was talking
about I'm just going to apply over my
eyelid okay so yeah I'm literally just
applying this over my entire eyelid
including the crease as well as I'm
going to go over with dark shade so I'm
just applying this a pink on top it's
such a gorgeous color like honestly I am
in love so now that the pink is applied
to my eyelid I'm now going to go in with
the burgundy red and I'm gonna be using
this good from the outside of my eye I'm
gonna just show you this it's gonna be
easier okay
so I kind of like dab it on the outside
and then I blend in from up there over
the crease because I like it to be dark
on the outside and then also of course
you guys know me I'm going to add some
shimmer as well and I do that last so
I'm just gonna do this both sides and
blend that in so again going with the
pinky toned I'm just blending it in with
the burgundy color making sure it's
still darker on the outside without
making it look too harsh though but at
the same time once I actually put on
weight eyeliner it won't look anywhere
near as harsh as it will kind of like
blend in with the eyeliner I think that
even I think that even so far okay I'm
going to go in with my morphe palette
and use the gold but I normally use if
I'm using gold at the bottom eyelid also
putting some found the corners too you
see what I mean by this like this god is
such a gorgeous god it's quite like it's
quite like a whitish gold but I think
it's so so stunning right there is my
eye shadow I'm now going to have to go
in with your eyeliner don't know if I
can even attempt this on camera but I'm
going to do a winged eyeliner so I'm
going to give it a go I use what I have
been using recently which i think is
really really good this is the Rimmel
London and glam eyes professional liquid
liner and I do actually think it's great
because the brush is so thin that it's
really easy to do the flicks and stuff
so I'm really hoping I don't know if I'm
gonna even attempt to put this on camera
but I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a go
oh yeah we were wondering by the way a
really really good tip that I found with
doing Alana is to draw the outside to
them fill it in after as you can tell
like I've just got weird kind of
triangle but I thought doing that and
then filling in after is actually a lot
easier because it's easier to get the
right shape that you want and to fix the
shape so that's like I do it on my
eyeliner I'm not the best at it but I
have become a lot better there is my
attempt with key from the camera on and
trying to do my eyeliner I can't talk
while so do it either like if somebody
speaks me I'm like not now I'm doing
mine I like honestly I actually get
angry like you don't want to see me
doing my eyeliner and trying to speak to
me it's just a no-go it's just an ogre I
have to bit like a hundred percent
concentration in whilst doing my
eyeliner so there you go let me know if
you can agree with that eyeliner is hard
oh I'm smudged it I've smudged it and
the web server there need to go we get
the white I always have to use a Wi-Fi
to do my eyeliner just a measure it's
like sharp as well you know and because
I have a critic nails it's so much
easier I kind of like you know put my
nail there and then just pull the ugly
at Facebook time and there's my winged
eyeliner yes guys got this in the bag
next up I'm gonna be going in with
mascara and I'm going to be using Italy
you would have heard me talk about this
before the maybelline cat eye mascara
this is fab love it love love love it so
I'm just putting this on my eyelashes a
really good technique that I think for
making your eyelashes longer as well is
by going down like it makes them quite
thick but then you spread it out as you
go back up I don't know I just think
it's a really really good technique my
friend once told me about it and I
always just done it since I just think
it's great and again they go in side to
side and doing it as well I don't know
different motions make your eyelashes
longer and I love having long eyelashes
and I am obsessed with false eyelashes
if you guys know any great like
alternative
- like demi whispies and stuff if you
know what eyelashes I'm on about and
like you know like those sort of
eyelashes like feathery eyelashes kind
of went for a cherry and stuff then let
me know because I am obsessed with
buying eyelashes like I think eyelashes
have become my new addiction which I
never honestly thought would be a thing
because I never used to wear them but
the difference they make are insane
especially when you actually find like
good realistic ones that make your
eyelashes that really long but at the
same time have that like feather look
like red cherry red cherry 43 eye lashes
are incredible radio so it's time to
actually stick on my eyelashes then I'm
gonna go with my lips take my hair down
sort my hair out and then yeah that is
going to be the end of this look so I'm
going it to you I'm going to use the red
cherry eye lashes in 43 I think as well
with eyelashes I think the best glue you
can get is the duo eyelash glue only
because it dries clear and honestly
makes all the difference in the world
like when you can see white glue I just
think like it ruins the entire eye like
it just looks stupid
so the final thing is lipstick I love I
have the loving Reds recently I think
Reds are just an amazing lipstick color
and oh my god it's just stuck to my eye
and because obviously I've got like
reddish eyeshadow on this is actually
called burgundy lip line up by it Mac
again it's great I know a lot of you
gonna be like why you applying it all
over your lip and it's lip liner but the
reason being is I've just decided in the
past 30 seconds I'm going to use a nude
and it looks really nice blended with
this burgundy lip liner so that's why
I'm putting it all over my lips and I'm
also still going to be outlining because
I'm going to put the nude like in the
middle of my lips it looks really stupid
right now with just the bottom done so
there is the liner done this burgundy
liner is literally insane it goes well
of so many different it's two colors so
I was going to use this red and use a
Viva Glam to go on top which is a
gorgeous red it is one of the limited
editions is actually by ariana grande it
is amazing I was going to use that but I
think I'm actually gonna go in with more
Dena yeah what do i do Drake do it red
or do I do a nude I'm gonna go over new
okay I'm doing a nude guys hey where is
it though if I can't find the color that
I need no way I have literally been
searching the house down for this color
turns out come back to their own method
of an off and just go to override it's
on my bed the entire time so this is
lady be good buy it Mac it is matte but
it goes really really gorgeous with this
red this I've been wearing like quite a
lot recently and everybody's been asking
me what my color is but it's both of
these two mixed together so I'm just
going to apply this in the middle of my
lip as you can tell they are completely
different colors
and the final site so once it has
actually dried Matt I'm now going to
apply the NYX butter gloss in the shade
Madeline this is literally insane and I
finally managed to get my hands on
another one after it being sold out in
Brighton for about six months right guys
