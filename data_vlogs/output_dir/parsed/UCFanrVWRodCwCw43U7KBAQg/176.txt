hey guys and welcome back to my channel
so hope you guys are having a lovely day
whatever time of the day it is that you
guys are watching this video so for
today's video I actually have something
a little bit different never done this
before but by the way I am super excited
to film this video so recently I've seen
so many different youtubers bring out a
wide variety of different products and
over the past few weeks I've actually
got my hands on quite a collection of
them so these are going to be like my
favorites and some of them I haven't
actually tried out yet so it's gonna be
like a review at the same time so yeah
this video is basically gonna be a
review and my favorite YouTube products
that I've actually tried out so far if I
miss any great ones out please let me
know down below but without further ado
let's get into this video so I'm gonna
solve so Ella as of course everybody
loves a little bit of zoella I know so
Ella anyway and I especially loved her
lifestyle range
I mean her home range is amazing so the
first thing I've actually ever talked
about is her so Ella lifestyle diffusers
now I actually picked up two different
diffusers the first thing you want to
mention about them is the packaging is
absolutely beautiful
I love the little detailing on the boxes
I think it's so pretty
I love this one especially because they
love the light pink and the little
flowers and this one to be honest I'm
not really short on the design but all I
know is it looks really pretty and I
personally really like it so the first
one that I'm going to talk about is
homemade treats now I have actually had
this one before and I had to pick it up
for the second time and it smells
absolutely divine this to me it smells
like somebody's been baking in my house
the entire day it's an amazing smell
it's really like it's like a sugary
really strong sweet smell which I
absolutely personally love it reminds me
of a lot of the Bath and Body Works
handles that I actually oh so it's kind
of like that buttercream and like salty
caramel kind of scent it's really sweet
really strong so if you love sweet
scents you have for sure going to love
this and then this is actually what it
looks like it's in like a glass
container it's very simple but I
actually really like how simple it is
and then it just has like the zoella ban
just going around the top and of course
it comes with the diffuser sticks so
that's what that one looks like and then
my Eden this one's more
more I would describe this as a more
chilled send this n isn't my favorite of
all the diffusers and I do really like
it because I would describe is kind of
like an original scent it's kind of like
outdoorsy I would describe it like a
reminds me of like flowers and it does
have the scent of jasmine and roses in
it with a garden in full bloom so that's
probably why it reminds me of the
outdoors also it kind of reminds me of
fresh-cut grass and I've always said I
literally love the smell when my grass
is cut so yeah that smell you're
probably gonna like this diffuser
but yeah the scents really refreshing
and I do still really like it but for me
personally the homemade trees is my
favorite out of the diffusers that I've
tried so far next up I'm going to talk
about so Ella's a lazy day at candle not
fancy I want to point out how amazing
the packaging is I love this is actually
my favorite part about this I think it
makes such a nice gift because basically
you open it up and it's like all folded
in a nice box and then underneath it has
like a different picture I believe in
all of the different candles because
it's really nice how it can just all
fall back up and just nicely go into the
box and I think it makes a really nice
gift for this candle again it's really
simple packaging it just has lazy days
and zoella on the front and again yeah
it reminds me of fresh bread sheets it
does say that it has fresh linen and
cotton so that'll probably be why so if
you guys don't do like like really out
there sweet cents and this is probably
one that you should go for I'm a copper
was pins and needles this happens every
time I feel oh my god ow
whoa so ever Barthel art a bath and
shower milk this is one of my favorite
things that zoella has ever brought out
just because it smells absolutely divine
it's like milky and creamy and like
vanilla and it smells a bit like almond
and it's just such a gorgeous scent and
when you pour it in your bath it's
really bubbly and it just has like a it
has like a really nice smell of white
luxury in it so yeah this one for me I
definitely write also want to point out
I really love the packaging as well
because it looks like a milk bottle and
I really like that the golden top as
well so yeah this is one that I
definitely do right out of all of our
products that I've tried finally I
picked this up I haven't
yeah that dudes because I really like
gingerbread and vanilla fragrances so
for me this one was definitely a must I
think the package is really nice and I
think this could be a really lovely
stocking filler as it's really not too
pricey or also a really nice present to
give to your friend I'm really excited
to try this out I can imagine it's going
to be amazing because I've had the
candor of this ginger cream so if it's
anything like the candle I know I'm
definitely gonna love it
so this is the one thing that I haven't
tried out but I'm desperate to try out
on over let you know over on my daily
vlogging Channel what I actually think
of these but overall I do think it's a
really really nice gift set and again
it's really affordable next up I'm going
to be talking about Gaby's Primark range
aka velvet ghost I absolutely love
everything in her collection but these
two are definitely by far my favorite
the neck pillow and the eye mask the
reason being because I travel a lot and
these are so soft even even the eye mask
is so fluffy and soft I just think
they're so cute and I love a good old
neck pillow oh yeah looks like oh this
is what I look like when I'm traveling I
always take a neck pillow with me so I'm
definitely going to be taking this one
with me I cannot wait to use it so I
must for college so I wish I was working
holiday I just think these are really
cute again so affordable I really love
the purple and pink throughout her range
as well just because I think it's really
girly really pretty so these two are my
favorites out of all of them this was 2
pounds and I can't remember exactly how
much this was but again linking
everything down below that I can't find
how much it was so these are my favorite
but there are some other products that I
do want to talk about being in her
stationary range so the first thing that
I want to talk about is this stationary
accessory set this I think is actually
so gorgeous I really love how it has the
gold in it as well as the purple and the
pink I think I have a little bit of
everything in here you have the rubbers
you have your list goes of course
everybody has goals everybody has those
goals
pens pencils everything kind of like
sticky notes and this is 5 pounds you
get a lot in there definitely great for
the money and I just think overall it's
really nice set really great for
back-to-school really affordable again
could
a really great stocking Villa so this I
do also really like also found some
really cute pencils that I really liked
as well oh actually this is one of my
other favorite things as well as the
neck pillow in the eye mask I am in love
with this pen it reminds me of horton
hears a who let me know down below if
you've seen that movie I freaking love
it yeah it's just so fluffy and I love
all fluffy things and what's not better
than a giant fluffy pen also in her
collection that I thought was really
cute I really like this notepad and also
really like the pencil case as well I
think goes really nicely with the whole
stationery set I think all of it
together is going to cost you like 20
pounds so it is really great so just
wanted to mention these as well but the
neck pillow the eye masks are my faves
out of Gabby's collection but now let's
actually move on to Tanya burr so the
first thing that I'm going to talk about
is actually her calendar so Tanya burrs
calendar this is actually the second
year that I've had this on both years I
think it's absolutely great I really
love the packaging of it actually I
think it's really really pretty
I do think you get your money's worth
with this calendar as well which I do
think is great I've got a really big
itch on my nose so I've opened only for
dress because it's 12 deep calendar and
I wanted to wait until the 25th to like
still be open in these so the ones that
I've opened so far I've got like a
lipstick and nail file a mirror which i
think is great because I love using
little mirrors I think they're just so
handy all the time everybody needs are
like a little mirror in like their
makeup bag or like in the handbag
handbag handbag so yeah I think this is
like a really cute and lovely idea and I
think it's actually a really great
beauty calendar so I've been using this
and I do actually really like it so far
this actually I didn't even think was
Tanya burrs and I picked it up and not
even thinking well I knew it was hers
when I actually went over to it but when
I saw this little makeup bag I thought
oh my god that's so nice and so when I
get that walked over to it thought what
was the heart there's tiny birds so yeah
I think this is a really really lovely
makeup bag I really love the fabric of
it as well because it's like re washable
so it gets less dirty you actually get
like a really beautiful dark red I
believe it's like the literary live a
little look no it's just like a darkish
read it's a really really beautiful
color and then also you get a liner
I love getting liners the match and lip
colors I've seen they're so hard to buy
separately so I think it's really great
that she's got these together and then
awesome inside I didn't even know you've
got it's another mirror oh yeah I
literally love having line little
mirrors I just think that's so handy
yeah another two mirror it's AG little
gold one which is really pretty but I
mainly actually got this for the makeup
bag not running for the things inside
but they're like an extra bonus and how
much was this I don't even know but I'm
gonna leave it on the side bar for you
guys and also link everything down below
oh yeah that was everything that I
actually picked up I don't feel like I
really got that much and I only really
spoke about three different youtubers
