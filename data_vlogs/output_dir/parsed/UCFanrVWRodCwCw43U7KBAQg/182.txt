yeah that's me
no seriously guys this is I think my
all-time favorite Christmas jumper I
think because it's like not too much but
at the same time it's so cute and it's
like Santa's safe oh yeah
hi everybody and welcome back to my
channel so today I am so freaking
excited to film this video because
actually guys can tell from the backdrop
behind me my really really adorable
Christmas jumper it is the first of
December and I'm kickstart in my videos
with letting you guys know what I would
absolutely love this Christmas obviously
I'm going to put disclaimer out there if
I don't get any of these things like I'm
not expecting to get any of these things
but if I don't get any of these things
like I'm not going to be like ungrateful
or unhappy like the main thing that I
would absolutely love for Christmas this
year and this has happened every year so
I've been very lucky it's just my family
all getting together and just being
happy and that's the most important
thing for me on Christmas Day and if I
could ask for anything like that is
obviously what I'd absolutely love but
these are things you know that people
can go out and buy you like family and
friends and I also thought hopefully
this video will help every one of you
guys out so I don't know if you're like
struggling to find Christmas presents
for your friends or your family or even
if you don't know what to put on your
own Christmas wish list if you're like I
don't know what's a hospital then
hopefully this video should help you
guys out and it has been very very
requested I mean far too requested like
in October October I repeat I was
getting asked to film this Christmas
video my Christmas wish list so here I
am
I'm filming it for you guys but before
we get into it I do just want to let you
guys know yes I am June vlogmas which I
am so freaking excited about and every
day on my blogging channel I'm doing
saffron's advent calendar which is where
I'm going to be doing a giveaway every
single day overall my vlogging channel
and some of the things I mentioned
in this video that I would love for
Christmas I'm also going to be given
away to one of you guys so look up for
that because there's going to be so many
different giveaways over on my
channel I'm linking it down below so go
check that out or just flicked my hair
go check that out after you've seen this
video but yeah let's get into this video
because I already feel like I've rambled
far too much do I was thinking as I want
to be more organized and I don't want my
makeup to get ruined cuz at the moment
with all of my makeup what I have I just
throw it in a bag and it's just get so
messy and then like things open and it
just gets ruined I would really really
like some makeup organizers like a big
one I have like little ones on the side
like where you just put lipstick and
stuff in but the thing is that makes it
even more messy because I just have
organizers like everywhere on the side
of my desk and it's just one big ramble
so I was thinking like why would
absolutely love for Christmas its you
can get the big organizers the ones that
like spin round they are so awesome and
like you can put eyeshadow palettes
blushes bronzers foundations brushes
everything all in one big organizer and
I just thought like it would just be out
the way it would look nice and it would
just be so much easier my makeup in
there rather than average is just like
shove it in a makeup bag so that would
be something that would absolutely love
and then what I mean by Ross is I was
thinking maybe if I didn't get that I
could get the organizers that you buy
separately and kind of put them like in
drawers like startup so maybe one drawer
just for my foundation and bronzers the
next draw for primers and concealer and
then etcetera etc basically I just want
one place to be able to put my makeup
it's kind of like out the way I'm not
just like you know rambled all over my
room because I'm looking around right
now and I can just see makeup it's
everywhere and I just want to sort it
out like it would help me so much so
that is the first thing that I honestly
would love for Christmas the second
thing that I would love I think I have
wanted for about a year and a half now
maybe two years these are the Tiffany
and Co heart earrings now I actually
have two Tiffany and Co heart necklaces
on its really annoying they always get
tangled and yes they are tangled right
now I just thought they go really really
nicely with an
because I'm wearing now and even though
they are very pricey the earrings that
I'm currently wearing aren't real silver
and in about a week my ears like go
gammy and gross and I have to take the
earrings out and then I don't end up
wearing earrings for another month
then I lose these ones because I put
them on the side and yeah it's one big
Jackanory that keeps going around and
they keep having to buy another pair of
earrings but if I got these Tiffany and
Co once I know I just have them on my
ears
they're real silver so I'd never have to
take them out and I would wear them
every single day so I would love them
and also I think is one of those things
where it's so expensive for something so
tiny that I would hate to spend that
much money on myself but I would love to
be gifted it I don't know if that makes
sense but it's just so tiny that I just
couldn't buy that myself but I would
absolutely love them and I know I would
wear them every single day see it third
thing that I would love is some it
candle so now I have an obsession with
candles I'm sure you all know that but
somebody was is like my ultimate fave a
bit here in the UK but we are getting it
here in the UK which is it's gonna make
me bankrupt definitely gonna make me
bankrupt I could not get enough of
candles and I think I have like seven in
my room right now but they are four
related so I'd love some like Christmas
scented candles because I just can't get
enough of them and even though I have
seven in my room right now
I know give me a month and they will all
be gone honestly I use them every single
night I like them every single night so
I never get a lot of use out of them I
love my room smelling so good
I think they look so pretty and candles
any sort of candle give it to me I will
use it and I love it
literally right let's move on it's more
one tumor oh you know what I'm saying
oh okay moving on the next thing that I
would love I've actually tried at many
events I've been to before they always
have them when I go to like fashion
beauty events when I get so yes every
time and these are just the light up
mirrors so basically it's just like a
little mirror that's like about the
shape of your head size and there are
little stands and they have lights that
go the whole way round and it's just so
much easier to do your makeup honestly
and I feel like it obviously it does
I felt like it air brushes your skin it
makes you look so much better it'll be
amazing to take selfies next to and it
will be so much easier to do my makeup
in because I feel like let me know if
you relate to this I'm one of those
people that cannot do my makeup in like
a huge mirror I like using like my
little mirrors I don't know why I think
it's just cause it's like closer to my
face so this I think will be like the
perfect size because you know it's kind
of like in-between some long knee-high
grey or suede boots now I haven't
actually found any of these yet so if
you guys can help me out let me know
down below otherwise I'm gonna have to
give these to my mom and just you know
set our challenge I love long knee-high
boots I wouldn't really wear these so
much in the summer so these are
something that I would love and now
which is why I'm arsenal for Christmas
and I have long heinie and black suede
boots but I haven't found any gray ones
yet and I love grey and grey coats are
pretty much everything and I really
would love some so if you guys can help
me out then please let me know down
below if you guys follow my Instagram
you definitely would have seen this
because I captured the picture for
Christmas please I really really really
want this for Christmas and this is I
don't know how you pronounce the brand
name I think I was like huda beauty
hoola I don't know this eyeshadow
palette I've seen everywhere like it's
gone viral on Facebook Twitter Tumblr
etc etc because the colors are insane
there's not one color in this palette
that I honestly wouldn't use I love the
dark like burgundy like ready tone
shades and then it's got so much like
glitter colors and just the whole
palette is just absolutely beautiful and
I know during like our winter season I
definitely know I'll be wearing the
darker colors a lot more on my eyes
another ring now I do actually have a
ring that I wear every single day but
for me I think I wear a lot of the same
accessories every single day well I have
a lot of accessories but like this watch
I wear every single day this ring I wear
every single day so with my necklaces as
always these two necklaces and even
though I love the jewelry that I have I
think I could definitely do with some
more and there's two rings that I
absolutely love on the Pandora website
and either one of these would be amazing
I've always wanted the tiara one
but I didn't want to get it just because
everybody else has it but now I'm just
like you know what let's just share the
love who cares like I'm really really
really freaking want this ring so I know
I mean you can buy a more than one ring
definitely I love it when people have
like five rings in one hand I honestly
think it just looks so pretty so I'm in
love it of a ring to add to my
collection a and microphone now I do
actually have a microphone for the
camera that I'm using right now it goes
on my DSLR camera and it's great I mean
it's working right now so it's doing the
job but I would actually love to step up
my game with my voiceovers I want to do
a lot more like routine kind of videos
more I have to do voiceovers and I don't
know maybe like makeup tutorials and
stuff like that
or I have to have voiceovers for and
currently I'm using my laptop just using
Final Cut Pro and just speaking into
there and it doesn't really sound that
clear and every time I do it in a
different position
it was sound completely different so I
have to make sure like I don't move and
it's really hard and I think it's one of
those things that I definitely can step
up my game with and I think if I get a
good microphone that I can record my
voice overs on it then I would be a lot
more happy with my routine kind of
videos and I know you guys want to see a
lot more videos like that because on my
Twitter and my Instagram I'm always
getting ass so I think I need to step up
my game a little bit if you guys have
any recommendations if you are into
filming or if you're a youtuber yourself
or even if you just know a really really
good microphone that I could use for my
voiceovers please let me know down below
because I'm not really entirely sure
which one I want because I've never ever
used one before but I would love to get
one so please never know down below and
that will help me so much
Anastacio striped liquid lipstick oh my
god write this lipstick I wore every
single day the very last drop in that
lipstick has gone because I wore it
every single day because it was my
favorite lipstick if you guys will
follow my vlogs the amount of people
that ask me what is this lipstick color
and every single day I think I told my
vlog which color lipstick this was it's
just it's like a darkish nudie color I
say it's like a darker version of Albert
with like a little bit of like a purple
tone in it it's just such a beautiful
color and I could really do a fit in my
life begins now of course I definitely
know in fact yeah I know I'm no way
would I be getting this for Christmas
but did I mean I think I would actually
start crying my eyes out I have wanted
this bag for about six years when I was
like 10 years old I saw this bag and I
said to my mom that is the most amazing
bag I've ever seen and I know to some
people it's just going to seem quite
plain but it's just one of those bags
I've always wanted as a kid and I would
literally die to have this bag and this
is a white Louboutin bag and it has
light pink inside and it's just
everything about it is so gorgeous I
think it's the river full bag the way
that it hangs it's such as this three
different sizes and the middle size is
the one that I love because they don't
like bags are too big and I don't like
boats are too small so I'm gonna go run
in the middle I can't even tell you how
much I love it I've wanted it for six
years I mean I would kill for this bag
