so I'm starting this routine around 5:00
p.m. and on this particular day I have
been out and just got the bus home as
you can see every time I walk through my
door my cute dog called Bella loves to
greet me in fact she loves to greet
anybody that comes to the door and if
you guys follow my daily bugs
you definitely would have seen better
before for me the best thing after a
long day is just taking off my shoes
honestly is the best feeling in the
entire world and then after that I head
to the kitchen I made myself a hot drink
to warm me up
PS that this market is actually my
all-time favorite mark I got it from the
Disney Store and oh my goodness every
time I have a hot drawing I have to have
it out as well because it's just too
cute and yes I am NOT a lover of tea or
coffee so it's always a hot chocolate
for me
also yes I know hot chocolate tastes so
much better with milk but to be honest
I'm just trying to be a little bit
healthier so I just thought what is the
better way to go and I mean it still
tasted so good anyway the only thing
annoying about a hot chocolate though is
I hate hate hate I'm so impatient I hate
just having to wait there for the hot
chocolate to cool down and I didn't wait
for the hot chocolate to cool down and
as you'll see yeah I really burnt my
mouth Oh Oh with my hot chocolate in
hand I'm going to bed out on the sofa
for about an hour to just editing videos
until I get distracted then watching
other people's videos and then after
that around 6:00 6:30 ish if I haven't
already eaten out my mum will usually
make me dinner and so she did if you
guys watch my daily vlogs you'll know
there's loads of us in my house so I
never really know if I'm going to be
eating with ten other people or if I'm
going to be eating on my own and today
yes as you can see I ate on my Larry
nobody ate with me and for dinner I try
and have if I like a portion of salad or
bed every single day so yeah
once I finish dinner I head to my
bedroom where I spend most of my time
and usually get changed into my slouchy
clothes and put on my most all-time
favorite zippers I mean come on guys how
adorable are these
the thing I love about this time of the
year is that it gets darker earlier so
basically it's just an excuse for me to
like all of my candles and trust me I
have so so many and yes I like every
single one once I made my Roman look and
feel super cozy I then go around myself
a hot bath sometimes it might be a
bubble bath but today I decided to run
myself a hotknife bar for the bath bomb
and this bath bomb was so good honestly
the so relaxing and it really got me
into that chill zone vibe that I was
like going for
again because I am obsessed with candles
yes I had to like more to make the cozy
vibe that I was going for somewhere lit
more candles and I put them on the side
of my bar I shoved up my hair and then I
got into my bath and I spent a very very
very long time in the bar I mean it was
possibly the most relaxing and longest
bath I've had in a very very long time
once I got out of the bath the first
thing I did was washed my face with some
water and an e 4 t 5 cream
honestly this is absolutely great at
getting rid of spots I've been using
this for years now as the doctor
recommended it to me and I don't think
I've honestly gonna do without using it
because it's amazing and I find it
really really works on my skin and it's
supposed to work for all skin types as
well so honestly I definitely recommend
it for you guys after my face is feeling
fresh and I'm feeling cleaned I then
brush my teeth and then now and then I
don't really have a particular day that
I do this and because I do this like a
couple times of the week but I then put
my teeth whitening onto my trays and I
put these onto my teeth for roughly
about an hour and then whilst I'm doing
this I just sit and like chill on my
phone catch up with videos and then to
be honest like that's it I'm ready for
bed so I then go into my bedroom I just
chill and my version of chill is just
watching other people's YouTube videos
and just catching up my friends so I
face I'm a couple of them I also edit my
daily vlog and then I'll end my daily
vlog and then once my daily vlog is
ended like that's the complete end of my
day so I just throw by pillows I get
into bed and then hopefully tonight I
have a good night's sleep and I hope
every one of you guys that are watching
right now if you guys are watching at
nighttime I hope you guys have a lovely
night seat and yeah that's it for me
I'll see you guys very soon with another

very very soon
