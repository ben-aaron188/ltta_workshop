hey guys welcome back to my channel so
for today's video I'm actually doing it
testing a Primark makeup haul and I'm
actually very excited for this because
if you guys follow my blogs and you guys
know me well you will know that I
actually love to shop in Primark fur for
the one thing that I haven't actually
tried is Primark beauty range I don't
know why I've just I think I'm just kind
of stuck in my own ways like I just love
the makeup that I use I've just never
really got around to trying out their
beauty section but today I actually am
I've picked up a lot of their products
the only thing is I kind of found it
really hard to find all the products
that I needed the one thing that I
didn't manage to get is concealer and I
use a lot of concealer so I thought this
is going to be like kind of a problem
but we will walk around it and I'm sure
that I will love their makeup I'm really
really excited to try so I don't want to
talk like in this intro for too long so
here is my primer bag I've been meaning
to film this video for like a couple of
days now so I mean it's kind of like
ricktum ruins bag but that isn't murder
and I have got a lot of makeup but I
also try to get brushes as well I mean I
haven't got every single brush there was
I only got managed to get four brushes
because that's all they had so I'm gonna
use half of the prime up brushes and
then half of my own one thing I was
absolutely amazed about this whole
entire bag everything I got practically
a full phase apart from concealer cost
me 23 pounds my foundation that I use
alone is 26 pounds this whole face is
less than just my foundation that I
currently use so I'm really really
hoping that I like this makeup so I can
start buying this and said because this
is just so affordable and I'm gonna have
a lot more money to spend not just only
on my foundation right so before I start
I'm just going to shove my hair up
the start of a foundation I have the PS
Pro Longwear Foundation and this is in
the shade Oh to warm beige the packaging
of this I absolutely love now I was
quite lucky because when I went into
primer they've literally just launched
their new Beauty range the packaging is
so much nicer than the old Beauty range
in Primark so I've kind of got like half
and half but this is the foundation so
I'm going to put some of this on my face
whilst using their foundation brush and
it also has a concealer brush at the
ends it's like a two and one this was
one pound fifty which is amazing and
this was five pounds there was not very
many shades to choose from and I licked
you just had to guess my shade color
it's actually going quite nicely because
I would throw my foundation to be darker
than my skin color and then I'll just
blend it in with my net I feel like I've
chosen the right color so I'm feeling
yeah this is this is actually really
nice I thought I chose something that
was way too dark for me like when I came
home I was like actually this looks
really dark but it's actually really
nicely matched to my skin color well not
to my skin color but match to my neck
color but this sort of color is the
color I would normally get my foundation
in I mean it's actually blending quite
nicely I'm just using this brush I mean
this brush is actually to be honest it
feels no different to a normal
foundation brush you can tell it's
really good coverage which I'm really
liking because I love high coverage
foundations however it is very gooey
which I don't like really tend to like
like it feels very sticky on my face
which isn't the nicest feeling but if
you didn't know like what it feels like
I would never in a million years guess
that this was prime up foundation do you
think it's quite sticky as well that
would be quite hard to like blend in on
my face but it's going on really nicely
so I'm just like stroking it around my
face because I think I put a little bit
too much on as well but it's fine
because then I can just blend it into my
neck
the next thing I picked up was this
Pierce bronze bronze palette now the
reason I like this was because although
I just I think I just dropped the little
brush obviously it has the iron shadows
it has a bronzer and then also have like
a shimmery bronze that I really really
like I was also thinking this like white
ish eyeshadow recolor because it's quite
sparkly I might try and use as a
highlight because I also can find me
highlight and we all know I love I love
love love highlight so the one thing I
would say about Primark is it's really
hard
you're not guaranteed to be able to get
everything you want which is quite
annoying whether if I went to someone
like their minerals a Mac you kind of
know they're going to have your
foundation they're you know they're
going to have your concealer there but I
mean that foundation that I just tried
and the foundation brush is actually
really good so I'm going to use their
little contour brush it came in a packet
of three it came with a blush brush with
this contour brush I then stippling
brush I'm just going to use this to kind
of contour with now the brush I think is
actually quite good however this bronzer
is not very loud pigmented it doesn't
actually I take that back
maybe he just wasn't put enough on at
this G I put a lot on but not really
that much came out and I'll suddenly
it's decided to say saffron now
we do work gonna play some on my jaw
line now and then I'm gonna put some my
forehead basically where I just contour
every single day
I mean it's quite good because it's
working but it's like it takes a lot to
blend it in
okay so normally at this point I would
put concealer over my face and I tend to
use a lot of concealer so this is like
quite like frustrating for me because I
just want to blah blows concealer over
my face then put there's a highlight on
top but I can't do that because I don't
have any concealer so I'm gonna go in
with the bronze II shimmer and I don't
normally use like shimmery bronze kind
of colors because they just put so much
highlight on my face would just look
like pure like committer
I'm just pure shimmer and it would just
look really awful but because I don't
have like highlight I'm gonna whack some
of this a bronzing shimmer on and again
I'm just using the contour brush for
this I feel like I really don't need to
put much on the brush because I feel
like a lot is gonna come out oh that is
really pretty actually it's a lot nicer
with the shimmer I would say definitely
so far I don't think anybody I know if I
was having a conversation with them they
would think oh your makeup looks
different like it looks pretty good I
actually really like this so far I'm
really trying to stick by just using the
prime up brushes so I'm gonna just flip
this round because I've only really used
one side for the contour and I'm gonna
use the little white eyeshadow as my
shimmer because it has a lot of glitter
in it I'm gonna use the same brush but
on the other side I mean these are
shadows are very pigmented so it's not
really given the highlight effect but I
wanted but it's definitely making it
look a bit more glowy the top of my
cheeks are definitely standing out a
little bit more as you guys can tell
it's definitely brightened my skin like
where I placed this highlight my skin is
definitely a lot more like glowing and
brighten out I like so now I'm going to
use that balagia brush this is the one
that came in the three set for 5 pounds
and I'm also using this blusher which is
the PS blusher this was one pound fifty
I didn't want like a really really dark
strong blush I just got a very like paly
color that I think will look very pretty
so hopefully it does actually come out
this color I actually really like to use
a blush because I think everybody has
natural blush to them and then they put
foundation on and it just goes so I love
to put blush so I think if I have like
the lighter shade like I've chosen now
it should look really pretty now I'm
gonna go in with my eyebrows I kind of
feel like I'm doing this is such a weird
Ordo it's just kind of whatever I pick
up the bag I'm doing next so I got this
eyebrow palette and this was two pounds
but I'm gonna be using my own brush for
this uh-huh
just because I know I literally won't be
able to use this brush and at the moment
especially because my eyebrows are like
terrible at the moment I'm in need to
get them done I'm just gonna use my own
brow brush but then use this brow kit I
think I'm going to use to two inches but
I'm going to start by using the powder I
mean that I broke it was actually okay I
only used the n shade the brow wax at
the end I think kind of has that purpley
undertone that I don't really like and
then the shade in the middle was like a
lot lighter then I tend to usually have
my brows so I found that shade actually
what's really nice you of my brows
however I kind of thought like those
with an eyeshadow on my eyebrows like I
had to put a lot on to get the color
that it is now but I think I think they
look again now going back with a PS
bronze palette I'm going to use the
eyeshadows inside there are four
different colors I'm actually going to
use a concealer brush to place it
eyeshadow on and then I'm going to use
my own blending brush because I couldn't
actually find any brushes for the eyes
so this is kind of all I've got for this
you
I'm actually really surprised I've
actually really thoroughly enjoyed
testing out all of these products
because they are so much better than
what I actually thought they would be
now I'm going in with the mascara and
this is FPS eyelash quantum and skaara
look how flimsy is like it's really
flimsy I feel like it's going to snap so
I'm having to be really careful when
putting it on but I mean it has given
them a lot of length to be honest I
don't think I'm going to be using this
mascara anytime soon like even though it
is only 2 pounds it has given them a lot
of length the mascara that I use for
right now is 5 pounds and it's
absolutely brilliant again it's only
like a drugstore mascara but it's so
much better than this I feel like this
has a lot of competition however I mean
it has done their jobs my eyes do look
okay and so the final parting to have
completed my face I am using the PS pro
rich color lipstick in the shade over
three pink I actually really like this
color this was the last one left in this
shade again this is from the new
collection the packaging is so nice yeah
it's a lot more pinky on my lips and I
expected it to be I thought it was gonna
be like kerb a darker more nudie shade I
mean for two pounds it is really nice if
you like pinkish shade lipsticks then
get I mean it is actually called pink so
I guess that is kind of my fault but
when you look at it like this it doesn't
look like the color on my lips right now
there is my finish makeup look I really
hope you guys enjoyed watching this
video overall I do actually really rate
this makeup I mean for how cheap and
affordable it is
I mean I do actually think it's really
good yeah go out and try it if you guys
