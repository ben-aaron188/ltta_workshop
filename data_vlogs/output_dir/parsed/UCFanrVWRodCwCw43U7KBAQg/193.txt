hey guys welcome back to my channel so I
hope you guys are having an awesome
Sunday so far so for today's video I'm
actually so incredibly excited for this
video because today I'm actually doing a
bath and body wax haul and a massive
like awesome giveaway as well that I'm
pretty excited for so yeah and they just
want to get into this video bath and
Bodyworks as you guys know isn't
actually in the UK yet which is so
disappointing I seriously do not know
how we have a bath and Bodyworks here in
the UK like m3 body ones form but they
we're still on a hot one obviously they
have one in the u.s. if you guys have
been following my blog she would have
known that recently have actually been
in the u.s. so if you guys haven't seen
my blogs the most you go check it out
I'm gonna leave my blog channel down
below and you can actually go see me
shopping in Bath and Body Works and biz
like that and like kind of behind the
scenes and also you would have seen that
I got my nose pierced
so I'm looking a tiny bit different my
not even notice because it's so tiny but
yeah I went to the US and I actually had
somebody laughs it's one of the first
shop so I went to there and they want a
little bit carried away but it's kind of
a good thing because it also means I've
got a pretty good smelling giveaway for
you guys so I can spend even if it's bad
this is just a lot of the bus this is
one of the bags I've got three bags of
goodies I think I'm gonna start with
candles I'm a little bit obsessive
awesome body wax like
when it comes to winter and like autumn
kind of starts and you just saw a top
handled just my obsession I did just get
candles but candles are my obsession
I don't really tend to use them that
much in the summer but the second autumn
I'm winters here I'm like okay candles
but somebody was place an order I
weren't there so didn't have to place an
order this time actually got to smell
them in real life so yeah let's get into
this video so before it you know into
the bag I'm actually going to show you
the candle what I have behind me because
if you guys know but the body words you
will know that this is actually a Bath &
Body Works candle I haven't wanted to
lie any of these candles because I
wanted to save them all for the video
but I got a little bit carried away and
I've lit two but two is quite good to be
fir books considering I've had these for
like two weeks and I still hadn't filmed
this video I was just like saving and
saving and saving but this one I did
actually like so this one's a pumpkin
french toast now Tom give registros I've
never ever had it before until this year
I've got told them I've got one for the
giveaway and what enough for me right
now
this candle I would say is the most
perfect candle for when if you're
freezing cold outside and you just want
to come in the house and just feel like
you know you're walking your house me
like home sweet home this is what this
candle smells like like this is one that
I would have in my hallway for the
second that I walk in the door because
this is the smell that you want to smell
it just reminds me of home
and I loved it so much and I've never
actually had french toast but just the
smell of this makes me feel as if I have
tried like french toast because it's it
just smells so much like it like
obviously it worked because it's called
french toast but I feel like I've had
french toast now I've had this candle so
this candle
I'm loving and I can't wait for one of
you guys to try this out as well and it
is already been burned a lot a lot been
yeah there's a day I've only used it a
day also guys as right as I actually
love candles I can't use lighters I hate
using them because I get too scared that
they're gonna burn my heart so joe
glittery tried like a hundred times and
it burned his fingers really badly but
it's lit that's all that matters so the
second candle that I picked up by the
way all of these were twenty two dollars
fifty well they were twenty two dollars
fifty
and then the very last day that I was
actually even America I went back to
Bath and Body Works and it was buy one
get one free and I come for anymore my
suitcase so it's like really really sad
home but this one is a marshmellow
fireside now to be honest I'm absolutely
loving the look of this candle I just
think it looks so pretty
like I love the look of this so somebody
walked into my room I know it just looks
so pretty and I love the color it's like
that gray color and inside it's
fragrances it has toasted marshmallow
smoldering woods fire roasted vanilla
and crystallized amber it's like on I
feel like it doesn't actually smell like
marshmallow I just told you to smell
this and his words were it smells like a
car freshener it's like it's just got I
really just got that really like fresh
smell to it I have a feeling when this
is lit it's going to be one of those
candles that smells so much better once
I've there so I can't wait to try this
but yeah this is the first year that
I've ever had this I think it had like a
different sort of packaging last year I
believe it was like a creamy beige II
nudie color in sighs I'm over whitey
color but I'm actually feeling the gray
I love gray so I was like yes gonna
purchase it's one my favorite candle in
the entire shop or bath and Bodyworks
I'm not even just bath and Bodyworks my
favorite candle ever I had this last
year and this is pumpkin pecan waffles I
had this last year but in like a smaller
container I'm not sure that actually did
do like bigger sizes of them and they
might offer I'm pretty sure I didn't in
this size or at least the bottom body
was I went to then didn't have this in
the big size so when I saw this I was
like this is constraining my vast impact
this is the main reason why I went to
bathroom buddy words and this one has
been lit this is the upper one I was
talking about this is my obsession this
candle
you could smell it from two rooms away I
mean it is so strong it's so sweet
some people might find it quite sickly
it honestly tastes like you've eaten a
waffle
like it tastes no taste I mean it
honestly smells like you've eaten a
waffle it's very sickly it's very strong
but it's just incredible
if you walk past a waffle sand and
you're standing right next to it this is
what it continues
smells like and I love what bones and
this has maple syrup golden waffles
pumpkin spice brown sugar they're the
fragrance notes it hasn't it as you can
tell everything is very sweet but this
candle if you're going to try one from
Bartha buddy works please try this
candle nobody I know has ever smelt this
and not liked it but I know if you don't
like like sweet and like sickly kind of
really really strong sickly smells like
sweeter smells I don't think you're
gonna like this but I don't understand
how somebody couldn't because it smells
so good but yeah I I really love the
smell of food so this is my fave pumpkin
a friend toes so this is the other
pumpkin french toast that I got this one
it's going to be going and my giveaway
so make sure you stick around to the end
of the video to see how you can actually
win at these giveaway I've actually got
more than one giveaway so make sure you
stick around I love love love this
candle and I love the packaging so this
packaging at the top is different to the
others the others have I'm also we just
know oh wait maybe it's just the ones
that I love like pumpkin scented candles
like any cabs were pumpkin in it because
nobody's pumpkin and like some sort of
food like punk a frigate oh is pumpkin
marshmallow pumpkin waffle so most of
might have the pumpkin on top but this
one doesn't
because it isn't pumpkin it is heirloom
Apple and look at the packaging it looks
so pretty it looks like my desktop
behind me this smells nothing like any
other candle that I have here it's so
fresh it smells like just pure fresh
fruit pure like fresh fresh apple and
the fragran I've had in it is red Kotlin
apple creamy sandalwood and Marsh mellow
this is also amazing
I'm pretty sure this has I thought I
also wanted to get this because it has
saffron in it maybe this isn't the one
there was a candle that has saffron in
it and I was like okay I need to get
that I'm pretty I was sure it was this
one but it clearly isn't but if you want
something really refreshing go with this
candle next candle this one's also going
in my giveaway I also have two of these
this is a caramel pumpkins well this is
what I mean
all of mine I like pumpkin because these
are my favorite scents I mean you can
smell the caramel but it's really
Strahm pumpkin this I would say is one
of my favorite ones I mean I do
definitely like it the reason I also got
this for my giveaway is because it's
just really got that autumn vibe like if
you love autumn as much as I do autumn
is my favorite season and this is a
candle for you because not only look
like Halloweeny and or to me it just it
smells just like pumpkins and it smells
really good like a sweet pumpkin
obviously because of the caramel and
this has got fresh pumpkin warm caramel
grated cinnamon and vanilla bean so also
have one of these for my giveaways I've
never ever smart this before I went in
the shop this year the only ones I tried
is the pumpkin pecan try to smell the
only one vote smell is the pumpkin pecan
waffles and the one that I'm literally
just about to pull out vanilla pumpkin
and Marshman I'm pretty sure is this one
if not yeah I think it is because I
think it's pumpkin marshmallow I'm not
sure but it's vanilla pumpkin
marshmallow and last year though but
this is vanilla pumpkin marshmallow and
this candle smells a little bit like the
waffle candle I mean it's a little bit
less sickly I would say like it's really
really sweet still you can tell this
definitely has pumpkin spice in it yeah
pumpkin spice creamy vanilla homemade
marshmallow and drizzled caramel I mean
all of those ingredients I love so I
love this candle I would say it this one
pumpkin french toast and pumpkin pecan
waffle was my favorite see what I mean
I'm loving the pumpkin since they're
just so good if you don't like like
sweet sweet candles they're probably not
gonna be at the canvas for you I have
got more candles I haven't got any of
the bigger candles now but I do have
some smaller curls so the next candle I
think you guys are definitely going to
recognize this if you're a big lover of
both the body works
this is sweater weather to be honest I'm
actually gonna be cooking at your nest I
don't really like this smell I mean it's
really a mean it's just like mint like I
definitely wouldn't choose this but I
wanted to like this candle because the
amount of people that say this is the
candle you need for Christmas is
ridiculous like everybody I know that
loves Bath & Body Works is one of their
favorite candles because they say it
just reminds them of Christmas but this
is the smell that they want to wake up
on on Christmas I'm not such a lover of
it yet but I think it might be one of
those ones that once you light it it
will have a complete different smell so
I'm hoping one I like this it smells so
much better than it does now because
it's just kind of weird I really minty I
mean I kind of understand where they're
coming from because it's kind of got
like that kind of fresh wood fresh minty
kind of smell um but yeah I mean I'm not
100% feeling this it's just why I've got
a small one but I'm hoping when I liked
it it was more so much better this one I
didn't actually know I got until I got
back and I was so happy because I saw a
video on it and I was like ah I should
have got that card or then as soon as I
got back I was like oh my goodness I did
get it so this is cinnamon sugar
doughnut I'm used to not be a lover of
cinnamon but now I am and cinnamon sugar
doughnuts
it smells like Auntie Anne's if you love
Auntie Anne's you gonna love this garden
because it actually smells up when you
walk path Auntie Anne's that's what it
is it it smells like cinnamon sugar
doughnut and it's mostly good I kind of
wish I got this in a bigger size now
services said my favorite kinda was
pumpkin pecan waffles and last year I
got it in the smaller size I actually
got it in a smaller size as well today
or I didn't get it today I mean I just
realized the day I got this as well oh
that has made me so happy
last year though it did not look like
this what it looks like on the big one
is why don't you sit like on this I
definitely prefer the look of the bigger
candles but I mean it's the small that
really matters
so they
all of the apart from the little
giveaway candles oh just drop my bag
some of those candles offered a giveaway
by also these really cute ones I just
thought was so what they are Halloween
fall candle so this one is vampire blood
and this is like that really really
strong bearing like berry juice that's
what this smells like
and then this one literally just smells
or pure pumpkins like that smells just
like a pumpkin so this one is perfect
pumpkin and vampire blood so they are
also going in the giveaway moving on
obviously I said I'm absolutely loving
pumpkin so I got this marshmallow
pumpkin latte body scrub gut smells
insane I have an at late last year I
actually picked up some sprays and a few
little candles from America from Bath
