them in the boxes however I helped open
quite a lot and use them quite a lot
already and it's only been three days
but I just loved everything I got so
yeah let's get into this video let's go
watch the one of the first presents that
I got for my parents I was so shocked by
like I could not believe it because I
ever wanted needs for like wherever year
now probably like two years and these
are going to help me so much of my
youtube like when editing video they all
use these so much so I'm so grateful for
this and these are these gold beets and
these are the studio wireless beat so
they're a bit bigger than these solar
boots and also obviously they're pretty
cheap and they're Wireless however they
do have a leads as well that you can use
so I'm going to show you guys what they
look like open it up it comes in this
case here then I open it up here are the
gold beats their gold and white they are
an absolutely stunning color I've been
watching this color like these is that
beads for so long use them a lot already
they're just so good the sound is
amazing sound quality these are the
first things that I got my parents
and then it also comes with a red link
and then also comes with a white year so
I don't know which one I'm going to use
I don't know I think regular that quite
cool but who knows
so my next president I actually got from
my younger brother my older brother
Jordan and Nicole and they all got me
these Eddie - trainers in baby pink and
it is the most gorgeous baby pink ever I
couldn't believe the color because I've
always wanted like baby pink shoes but
whenever I find baby pink shoes or some
kid sections and I'm like alright wise
on out smaller feet but they found these
ID - shoes and they're really cool
they're like your knitted I just love
them so much so you would definitely see
me wearing these a lot so thank you so
much all of you
they got me these the same thing I got
my parents which is so so pretty I will
be wearing this all the time in fact
everything I got I'll be using I'm
wearing all of the time and this is
absolutely gorgeous this is a Victoria
Secrets robe it has the wings on the
back in Taiwan T's everything is I don't
want to get it dirty again because it's
silk silk pajamas on anything silk on my
favorite like I used to wear silk all of
the time when I went to bed much as that
texture feeling it's just the most
amazing feeling
this is so pretty and they got it from
Victoria Secrets and they got it from
the Victoria Secrets in America and what
so true it's just one size but yeah I
love it so it's very much for my cutie
of a friend Jasmine I got the most
amazing present and I'm not gonna lie I
said this is one of my favorite presents
that I got and they are so thoughtful
they actually bring like tears from our
eyes when I opened them and so the first
thing she got me was this picture of
myself Jasmine and my friend Abby and
it's at prom but it's just so thoughtful
because she actually went out to
printing it and then putting it in like
I don't want to frame that match is my
bedroom
so it would be up in my room every
single day this one I am so in love with
it's got two different pictures in it
it's got a picture of me and all my
friends at prom and then a picture or my
girl band when I was in a girl band
jasmine was also in it my friend Liam
today I'm afraid Georgia was in it so
here's a picture of my girl band it's
like really hard like show you because
of the lighting but is a picture
you'll Turk and it's also one of our
favorite pictures so I was really happy
about that and it's like a really really
sweet memory so it's always going to be
on my side for me to look at everything
today and as well as that jasmine also
got me this candle which is so pretty
it's like gray roses the whole way
around before my friend lit me I
actually got a big pink glitter box but
it's not actually in there anymore but I
do have the box down here came in like
this big pink glittery box and it was
wrapped so cute however I was so open
but inside I got this pink jumper and I
absolutely loved his jumpers because I
stopped my stitching and down here it
had like this I can't really explain the
pattern this really summery and yeah I'm
really excited to wear this because I
just love the pink jumpers and she knows
as well so I'm gathering and that's why
she got it from me so yeah that was the
first thing that she got me and then she
also got me another present as well
Libby actually got me a Pandora charm
for my Pandora that my parents want me
in this box here I will show you the
Pandora bracelet that my parents got me
yeah I'm so excited for this because
it's just so pretty and I've also wanted
a Pandora for so long as well and
there's like seven Tom's I've always
wanted and like I've never actually had
a Pandora to be able to get any of the
charms yeah I'm really excited opened it
up and it's the silver Pandora bracelet
I think it's normally like is it a
square is it a third boycott remember
but it's normally at the top of here but
it's actually a love heart to coaster
bracelet and then I actually have the
two charms that I already got actually
on it because I have been wearing it
every single day but obviously I had to
take off for this video so the first
time that he got was a carriage Tom from
Livi and this I was like a little tiara
at the top and all the seven that I worn
pretty much how tiaras up top because I
just never really pretty so she got me
down and I was so happy about that
thankfully I opened the Pandora bracelet
before the charm because if I opened the
trommel would have been like why has she
gone Bhutan without a bracelet like
that's really sweet but why and then
obviously I would have been refused but
I actually got an eraser beforehand and
my parents got me this camera charm and
I was so excited about this because I
was on the plane on the was on the way
to America I feel is all the way back
from America and I saw this charm and I
was
ah they have a camera charm at the time
1d in the middle mom like I need a
Pandora bracelet and she was like yes
yeah but you don't have one I was like I
know another person I got my parents
it's a sports bar from Victoria Secrets
they got this in America
so it's BFFs and I got this in the size
medium I thought all of you guys know
who saw my recent video I had the Becca
Jacqueline Hill highlighter in the shade
champagne pop from America and it
smashed it was a heartbreak so my
parents when it got me a new one they
actually got it from the UK they've got
it in space and cave never do they had
it there until like everybody started
tweeting me say you can get it from me
get it from here I was like oh thank you
so much my mum and dad got me this
placeit that I actually do love however
when I opened it it was like I'm really
not sure he's gonna like this but I
absolutely loved it I could not believe
they thought that I might not attached
out of it it's like wooly and in fluffy
and it feels so good it's just like a
plain grey peso and it comes down very
low so they got me this like Barnett I
believe it's all a disease so I look
really really pretty love it and I love
it
where is it from I've been active from

really pretty knickers from a few
avenues I don't know how you pronounce

is an oil you can get it from like
Primark and every time I'm with her I'm
like I really need to get some of this

already worn these I actually wore these

pretty tasty I loved that you bought for
myself my birthday I saw this in the
heritage store actually when I went
downstairs I was like oh my goodness I

bright red eye I don't think we happen
in any of the shoe stores and write it
and I was like okay I really really want
to get these bombs severely offensive
should I should I should I shouldn't I
don't like no don't get them you've got
enough shoes outside really really
convincingly not to get them and when I
left her food I was like damn I regret
not getting them shoes but obviously Jay
