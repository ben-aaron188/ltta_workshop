with Sephora as I must say it was my
favorite shop in America oh my goodness
lately we walked in there and I was
freaking out if you guys are not like a
massive fan of makeup you're gonna think
like I'm so wrong it was like a chicken
with his head coughs I'll give you an
example what's happen was like I think
there is yeah it's tough walking in oh
good you're good here Oh mom dad look oh
my God look at this over here
No do you like that ice a little bit
like that Jake and I spend a long long
time in Sephora and I literally ended up
getting banned by the end of it
I was like all come girls before I say
son ever why oh and members that know
you're not coming in there the boys have
had enough enough saffron I'm just well
okay so anyway I have three bags from
Sephora it doesn't look like much but I
spent a hell of a lot in there literally
I'm bankrupt right now can have a bad
squeeze Jake oh thank oh thank you
giving me all three these are the three
bags I got but I'm only gonna go through
one now it's gonna kind of be like a
mix-up whole because I don't want to
pull those of you if you don't like
makeup which is loads and loads of
makeup Oh
quickly can we quickly tell them the
story what was I like in the restaurant
okay blue bars gala steak steak was
coming over and saffron had all of our
stuff style on the table like this I got
was from Sephora yeah we just went there
safley
that this was also yeah right gonna be
I'm so excited to do this video to tell
you guys about it so the first thing I
got from Anastasia Beverly Hills is the
milk shake liquid lipstick it is
absolutely gorgeous there we go so it's
a really really gorgeous color it's like
a hot pink color Jade you might as well
be a beauty guru I know so wise I was
showing my family what I got in the
restaurant at Jake was doing that
everything I got I was like okay Jake
you want to be a beauty guru that's the
first me I got I think it was $20 I got
a lot of these these I would say are
probably one of my favorite lipsticks
ever
so the second liquid lipstick I got from
Anastasia Beverly Hills is actually in
the color stripe and it's add to the
color I'm wearing right now
and I love it a lot a lot a lot look
look oh also guys I'm really undecided
we have to do a lipstick collection so
let me know in the comments below
because now I have every single
lipsticks that my heart desires so the
final thing in this bag is the Smashbox
primer
I wondered this for so so long now like
I've just in so many people raving about
it you have no idea probably even
primaries do you actually take a guess
what primaries you put on before makeup
you do know what it is I'm so proud
don't you feel like the luckiest girl in
the world
I have been wanting a bag for like two
years my bag this bag and Jay Goodis for
me it's from Michael Kors don't let
explain what it is it's a backpack for
Michael Kors and it is ordered
I love it largely when I went to America
I wanted this and I've loved it and I
was like oh my god guys how amazing his
bag and this time when I went to America
J keep got it for me so it's a black
backpack and it has like gold stars on
it it's just black and gold as a front
zip pocket and then a front back and the
idea as well from that little gear does
that make sense pop yeah but you can't
if anything Kim no that's just like to
look good your shade but this is what it
lets take close-up it's like the perfect
size as well just not too big basically
I'm loving backpacks at the moment I
find they're so much better than
handbags now oh by the way guys dated
get off my birthday don't you so I am
very very very lucky so thank you very
much my barfi it hasn't actually been
yet it's like an early birthday present
above use on the 24th July so it's very
soon oh we're going to send a box for it
so excited I went to bars and forty was
one thing I want to say I was actually
really disappointed with basketball
Duarte's because last year when I went
to America the cans in there was insane
I had the most amazing time because of
the candles
they had no candles it was like such a
small bottle money wise if the net down
but I had an offer are you that bored in
my video buzz right got his Japanese
cherry blossom it smells good
you also forgot about this one in my
hood this is Japanese cherry blossom oh
it's twinning absorb do you find me that
no I just got my help
I've got that myself what's that in my
pocket a thousand wishes fine fragrance
mist bath and Bodyworks I was not like
plaid to run away guys that we didn't
just like put on his hood and put it in
his pocket deliberately or anything
how old are smell - smells good in it
miss walnuts my swamp no no no what
about them that one's so nice how can
you not like it
it is nice but doesn't taste nice and
then I got this see what things in
father body-wise japanese cherry blossom
again a french market apple basically
I'm really really happy about these
because I always use hand gel because
like I just hate my hands being gross
and then I realized oh my goodness they
have sprays they have antibacterial
sprays that is cool right do they have
that everywhere I thought just maybe I'm
really thick cuz I've never ever seen an
antibacterial spray before so I was like
I'll get a hundred people that's gel
squeeze out with gel so I'm saying it's
amazing men its prey and they smell so
good husky and get so much they were $10
each $3 each no yeah oh you're facing so
excited then yeah yeah I was really
excited to follow
oh good girlfriends
okay dad gotta get out oh my god no no
it's not funny
Oh frickin hard rock cafe so Jake and I
article matching comes in way yeah this
is it is a small block cut out who shot
sir Las Vegas is really annoying so I've
been really wanting to wear it but cuz
like a makeup I haven't been wanting to
get it dirty
now I can actually wear it oh no ya know
we had a sweet shop and I decided to get
bean boozled challenge now I'm not quite
sure why Jake so you're gonna regret
this decision weren't you yep what did
you say to me disgusting is especially
conformant oh my god I was like Charlie
so we have on now
No okay so saffron promised that I could
show this one to you it's there for mud
look how cool I know every point he was
taking the mick I'll be there is what
you get it I have to sneakily get this
cuz then do my mum would be like no put
that down
you know getting that so I was like but
it really wanted what's wrong my gosh
and it yeah it's from the rainforest
cafe and ice make me wine and got it and
I love it
Oh MC JB aha I can you we decided to get
these awesome matching and cap chicken
terrible bizarre senseless vacant on it
we got it from this Vegas got it from
Walgreens and it was only $10 we thought
why not they actually are really nice
yeah it's like a pound so it's pretty
good so are there two really happy about
this we wore them quite a bit dim well
yeah I actually wore mine more than my
expensive like no expense that Victoria
Secret say oh that was a sale don't
think I've got anything in the sale go
yeah I did I got one thing and oh my god
I love it so I got this top from BS and
I love it so much it's Monica gym top
rather than like everyday top I would
say I'm definitely gonna work with gyms
so much I just I love this color is such
a blonde hair down the back it has like
pink going down pink from things so I
got these that same jacket to match it
has P I and then NK going across and
it's just like a zip up Hoodie it is the
most ugliest hoodie I have ever worn and
you guys would have seen me wear this a
lot because I just can't stop wearing
so cuddly and then for one of my friends
birthday present sorry Jake
I go ahead this pink top it's
practically the same with mine again
it's more likely to impair she's been
saying she wanted a gym best for a very
long time now
so the others are really nice presently
get and this was 26 pounds or $34 and
then the final thing from pings I dunno
check it in the sale it was $36 I have
so many makeup ass but not like an
actual big makeup bag that I can like
just stop click in my room so I was
really happy about this it's like gold
leopard print and then it has the blue
six and it has like loads and loads of
compartments so that oh I love it
well speak so fun but I so many
compartments a which is why I love it so
I can put our brushes and stuff there
and I probably put like lipsticks or you
know just a little bit set and then this
but here it's absolutely huge and it has
makeup in it already so yeah it's really
we like handy and useful forever21 a
Jake also loves to shop as well don't
you
but you loved this shop before we went
in this job what did you say jakey what
did you say this is my damn pal this is
my idea of how it takes as the free
Ward's in this shop because I put a bag
of things that he absolutely lives and
dies in know and love so the first thing
I got is this top here it's so pretty I
really really liked it I did see where I
would like it so I just left it there
and then later all my mom was like oh my
god stuff oh my god you like this and I
was like yes I was going to show you
that so this was $19 90 I don't know why
they didn't make it $20 so you find it's
weird your top speed on what therefore
you tensed oh for three things I love
this so much yeah he's really really
crazy just saw the mermaid on it and
it's really cute the only thing is it's
very like see-through and it's like skin
tight and then I love these sunglasses I
actually forgot about these I don't know
how because I love them so much so I'm
glass is like my oh god not really when
they have the title mitt but they're
like my new favorite thing I think these
are just so cool they have got like the
rounded circle don't you
ha ha nobody do I've got a video for for
for you it's uh oh
one of my favorite items that I got from
Sephora is this Tarte glossy lip paint
lipstick and is in the shade hella they
only have one left and I was like oh my
god this is such a gorgeous color
although I have no idea how much that
was I think it was like twenty dollars
actually not gonna lie this the best
thing I've got from Sephora how much
they rave about this Jake how much are
they going about it in the shop we're
gonna yeah I say why don't just come in
Sephora every morning we're here put
makeup on then leave I got the Becca
Jacqueline Hale I haven't actually got
the packet I don't know where it's gone
honestly so most gorgeous highlighter I
have ever ever ever used I've always
been obsessed with the bar Mary Lou
highlighter but then I tried this and
it's just like oh it's just another
level and look gold but it's like
actually got a bit of a white shimmer to
it I'm wearing it right now is all so
many people raving about this I've been
wanting to try it for so long and I got
the shade champagne pot and it was $38
and then the final thing in this bag is
the NARS concealer to be honest I
could've got this one England but like I
was just there like everything I wanted
I thought you know what I'm gonna get
now I'm gonna treat myself so I've got
the NARS concealer in the color custard
and actually it's really good I know I'm
gonna use the maybelline concealer so
just think you can't go wrong Brittney's
may be good however it's a lot more size
emotion noise add whatever and you watch
me guess boo Maybelline and then the
final thing in my Sephora bag is a
Anastasia liquid lipstick in the colour
naked again I bought two with these I
didn't actually mean to you but then I
thought you know what I'm not gonna be
