what hi everybody and welcome back to my
channel today I'm going to be letting
all of you guys know what's in my
backpack I have been a what's in my
school bag video before and you guys
seem to really enjoy it to be honest
there's not going to be that much
different
apart from in my rucksack I put so much
more things inside of it literally I'm
going to pull out Mary Poppins when I
show everything inside my bag because
there's so much in here and it is quite
heavy to be honest but because it's a
backpack he doesn't like really feel it
when you know you've got both straps on
but let's go to start off with my
backpack now I seem to be using this a
lot I'm in love with it it's so comfy
and I generally obviously definitely
obviously do that make sense
I love the colors I mean it's only black
and white but it goes with everything
which is the reason why I use it a lot
this bag is actually from new look and I
think it was like 20 to 25 pounds it's
such a great bad because it fits so many
things inside of it and because I'm
traveling a lot more nowadays I need a
lot of stuff to take with me and
obviously I don't want to take like a
huge handbags it's really uncomfortable
or suitcase so honestly I just take this
and it fits so many things inside of it
usually I would take my laptop if I'm
traveling like either on the train or
something but last time I went out I
actually did take my laptop so that's
the reason why it's right here now in
this it pocket here
I always carry around lots and lots of
hair bands and a scrunchie the reason I
take lots of hair bands is very obvious
because what female goes out without
taking a hairband
like if you're a female and you forgot
your hair bags you all know that it's
like so annoying especially when it's so
all or stuffy wherever you are and
you've got your hair down you just want
to shove her hair up and if you can't
it's just so damn annoying so I always
take hair bands out with me so this one
pocket here I would call it like my mini
23 pockets because inside it has a mini
deodorant gentiemen oh this is soft and
gentle deodorant
I always carry a deodorant man because
this sounds kind of gross but in case I
get kind of sweaty it when doing some
sort of activity or even if I'm on the
tube and you know you can get a bit hot
in there gets ready to other people
around you can get a bit so edges that
you're kind of sneakily spraying me down
around and then I also have well
recently I just discovered that I have
hay fever so I've got these two girls
one a day hay fever tablets and then I
have face wise I think I only have like
two inside the packets very empty
but I won't go around my everyday makeup
bag with me as you'll see in the big
pocket in a minute and a case something
goes wrong I have to take those words
with me in the side pocket here I
actually have no idea what I have to
pack is of chewing gums extra cool
breeze and just extra peppermint must
say cool breeze I just have to say this
isn't the best trained gum ever
I hardly ever not buy cool breeze honest
I don't have it which would have been
this time I'm addicted to doing them and
then obviously my earphones they are a
tiny bit tangled that's the worst thing
in the whole world so I really really
need to thought this out but to bonus is
not that table so it's called final
pocket I have my eye brain charger I
also got tangled in my hair I also
hardly ever go out without my phone
charger because if my phone dies I'm
licked you like no I don't know what to
do and how do I contact people and when
you don't hit your phone charger out
it's just the worst thing because it's
not even like you can borrow around and
strangers phone charger so always always
take my phone charger out my phone tend
to die very quickly because I'm on it
those to say most of the day no lies
so no for whenever well for a meal with
something and there's a pub looking
around I am there straight away plugging
my phone in or I'm searching around the
place wherever we can see even if it was
out for a meal or wherever I'm always
looking for plan socket to charge my
phone because I'm on my phone at hell of
a lot the first thing I have at the top
of my bag is my everyday makeup bag I
never ever go without my mate
even if I don't use it I just have it in
case of emergencies it case one of my
friends meeting forum a car for the
having a makeup crisis I always take out
my makeup bag I was also thinking of
doing what to my everyday makeup bag so
let me know if you want to see that in
the comments below
alright on the pole either that side or
that side I can never remember I always
get the wrong but but on the part if you
want to see that video or let me know in
the comments below because it's
something I definitely would want to
feel oh by the way so many people ask
more my rooms or where they actually saw
this and in my blog where was it makeup
and from it's actually from a sauce it's
by the brand skinny dip but on a sauce I
think it was six or eight comments for
the night I think it's 12 pounds I don't
know if it's on there somewhere I think
it's like 12 by 8 pounds something like
that but the next thing to my Mary
poppin bag so my phone of course never
going to go out without my phone I have
the iPhone 6 in silver and then my
absolutely adorable phone case which I
love the pieces is from boohoo and I
think that was six pounds is what it was
having a live link then look how it
looks if you watch my recent vlog you
would have known that my phone got
stolen recently oh I'm so many of you
are washing Unicom phone case on it
no it wasn't thank you goodness I hardly
ever go out without this phone case on
as well but that one day I just didn't
something just must have known I don't
know but yeah
still got my unicorn case thank goodness
although my unicorn case will speak
pound and the phone was like 500
something so yeah cry imagine so excited
to talk about the next thing I'm about
to put on my bag and this is the naked
balance oh my goodness I love these slow
March
I always take one right in my bag
because they're like my obsession
they're like a healthy tree and I always
take them around with me because
whenever I'm peckish there's some things
that I always eat so this is the naked
coco crunch bar I love this one and I
love the Coco orange one but I literally
hate all the other ninja bars of course
I've got a bottle of water with me I
don't know
then everybody takes a bottle of water
out with them to stay hydrated at the
moment I'm trying to drink a lot more
water because in the past I didn't
really drink that much more water and
now I'm really really transferring to
that oh it's also sometimes I put fruit
in my water like a detox kind of thing
it tastes so so gummy but like it's hard
to find the time to put like fruit ends
up I know it sounds really really lazy
but just sometimes you just grab them
what important we leave the house so
that day I don't put fruit my water my
past
obviously I took my past pretty much
everywhere I've heard this purse for
actually quite too long now I think it's
time I definitely need to get a new past
as much as I do love it I've had this
with so many years it's by Ted Baker it
is actually really good quality although
my does look very old as I've had it for
very long time in here I've got my boost
card my obsession literally pop my life
this pausing part but through smoothies
are like amazing
I used to have the smoothies but
obviously they're not as good so juices
I'm definitely going with them now and
then I have my debit card my health
insurance card
that's when Anna's car behind this is a
dividend speech' card and then these
cards up here on C I haven't touched in
for so long I don't even know what they
are it's kind of pointless to have a
picture it's actually a Polaroid picture
of Jake and I that we took on the 3rd of
the 10th 2015 and then inside I just
have lots and lots of receipts and I
always have just loads and loads of
train ticket in my purse like you can
get them out I always always have them
because I'm always always on trains and
I just knocked one off Oh
have 15-pound today is my good day
then lucky dip oh my neck ooh Coco
orange already Ethernet empty wrapper
find out is it's very very hot and sunny
recently oh my goodness which is so
happy so I've been carrying around my
sunglasses with me I actually no I think
I have two pairs I have another pair of
sunglasses in her as well as any I think
these ones are really really cool and
these are from Peru whoo and these are
six pounds and I love them
yard oh yeah yeah I do and then this is
the reason that I love these as one of
them obviously looking so nice they look
so much more expensive than they
actually were I think these were like
twelve pounds and they just look so much
more expensive and they're really really
big so I was ringing me
I just love convincing me so my camera
battery died about ten minutes ago so I
had to put this one on charge as
unfortunately I only have one camera
battery which is so damn annoying
if the light is change or I'm in a
different position then I'm sorry so
Angela the sunglasses so let's see
what's next
inside my dad oh of course my vlogging
camera obviously is going to be my bag
as I vlog most days if you don't follow
my channel ready then you won't
know that and if you do do you all know
that
so I vlog with the canon g7x which is
really really good
although the canon g7x 2's just come out
and I wanted so badly because the focus
is meant to be so much better like
everybody's caught it has said like it
makes a massive difference and then for
this month on top I hope you guys might
think oh why should God that like weed
hair is everything it's not an accessory
basically it like looks out the window
and outside so you can't hear or like
that muffled noises it's action
that's great demonstration saffron
moving on the perfume of course I love
it they kind of get like to the end of
my bath now oh I have another perfume in
there too and this
is the Jimmy Choo Boston perfume it is
amazing this is like my go-to perfume
it's like insane definitely recommend to
go by is so so nice my Polaroids so I
don't always take this out with me but
obviously recently I took this out so
I've just left it in my bag
I do love paranoid pictures I only take
them like at a special occasion or a
special moment at the end of my bag
didn't even know I had this in here this
is the Mac strobe cream this is a primer
that I use that always sort of got on my
bag you just probably fell out Malika
bad okay that is everything inside all
the reason I forgot how could I not talk
about these in the side pocket of my bag
here and these are most amazing mix it's
not gonna light so I have a kindly
Jenner lip gloss that I'm absolutely in
love with it's unlike any other lipgloss
I've actually tried because the color
really does show up most losses are just
see-through whether this really does
have like such a gorgeous color and then
I have Lime Crime Kashmir and Lime Crime
delete and delete oh my goodness is
amazing that time that actually is
everything in my backpack so this has
been what's in my backpack
my name is Ephraim Barker and I will see
you guys next week
Oh
