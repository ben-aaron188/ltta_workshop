anyway doing a Q&A no you know as well
basically you guys ask me questions I
would social media like Instagram and
Twitter and I answered your question
let's just go on what am i a superhero
my love you know you - my favorite
superhero right now this is really hard
because I don't really watch the knee
like a superhero films I would have to
say spider-man only because it's my
favorite movies and their love is the
only movie where they could choose and I
love it a lot I have asked what is the
most embarrassing over many many times
and I would say this is my most
embarrassing moment but my most recent
embarrassing moment and this happened
the other day by there were two nights
ago when I was said to Martha my mom and
I we were in the floor as father
we had like these white burrows - really
cause I never have been to a spa so it's
really cool nice day and I was in the
outside the jacuzzi
get out I was like a brown thing and I
asked my mom to pass me my robe and
she's like my little special soldier you
just part of my room so just goes right
there and walk up pull a car over the
road next minute I stood on my road and
I sneaked down there and obviously it
was the most embarrassing thing and you
know you and you just have to laugh as
well because everyone else is laughing
with you so there was me pretending to
laugh so I kinda thought make less
embarrassed that piece of I found kind
of money
it was so embarrassing a moment without
being polite the rest of the day that is
definitely the most recent advice and
things happen
don't bother cost our jeopardy co-star
what is my favorite kind of set now I
would say at the moment Stephanie's from
pumpkin in it I don't know why like if I
smell pumpkin think is mom very nice but
all the kind of things you are buying at
the moment are pumpkins so that is
everything my favorite saying
what's your baby or something right now
that we love each other very some right
now is how I think by Drake that I love
and rate them that I thought I would
date - that is so fantastic happy and oh
my goodness the video is done - which I
race car that's Boise right now they
have the best thing same thing I guess
to go where before though just watch
them and attendance money is my fav in
life it is cracked me up so much so
that's don't reach my favorite some
enjoyment how as I started even
Christmas how long would we be putting
up Christmas decorations I have so it's
so so excited process because it's my
baby challenging year it's so much fun I
love you loose espero at every single
year we set up our groups and roses on
the 1st of December so that anyone will
be doing it some people it may sound a
bit to me it takes forever just wait
until December time if you have to know
you have bright colors one month only
all colors right now I'm interpret eat
garbage either pink or maybe and I a
perfectly gray color that's one really
weird I can't explain the car but pink I
love you care so much I wouldn't really
say variety may be a bright lightning
that make sense
I have people on a photo of myself
incident how many of you saw that and I
got a lot of different options but I
actually loved it so much
right why the st. my mom kiss I want the
care but only for like two weeks so that
would be perfect for me because I would
want to stay with pink hair Mike I just
wanted for like you know a couple of
photos copper there's eggs out and then
it just to be back to my normal color
because I work like that
so I can t that'll be amazing to me and
I'm definitely loved having care
favorite clothes shop I would say this
would be probably my Island favorite TV
show now I don't really watch TV if I
was to watch TV could be if something
these come on like The Apprentice or I
was 17
they not my favorite by far but 2070
watch TV more piercings would you try to
in the future now actually I want so
many ear piercings at the moment it
might is I have two piercings here and I
have them on this side and I really like
the third one here or my helix at the
top here I would like another one below
or even like my training stuff which is
this part of my ear I actually haven't
really stopped before when I loved it so
so much but the problem was with this is
I went around holiday that's the back of
there and it's not the same as any other
earrings I could but another earring in
I did have with me so it closes off but
that was really sad for now I really
want to go get another one done but
piercings are so expensive and they're
so tiny and they're so expensive
why however with hate now I just choose
take normally but hate me because most
people that hate on me don't actually
know me I don't know I kind of slowly
these funny people because there was a
clearly I've got about government their
lives so they hate my mind so hyoe
strategies they ignore it
and obviously I won't judge them for
method so I don't know why they wouldn't
now I describe to Sonora how I ever
broke any bones no I haven't broken any
bones although I have bought all the
ligaments writer side of my leg now this
is the weirdest story right I sat down
on my bed and an outer space I have one
leg straight up on lifeblood and were
like I wanna let like kind of Macbeth oh
I do we know how to explain that next
minute I could move blade she could not
be by leg use the most pain think if I
was if I might cramp but the worst
crappy ever mind their life hour later
I'm sitting there crying through my eyes
out the ambulance all around
I was on a dread having loads of tablets
and whatever I was I have kind of I
ended up putting all the ligaments in my
leg I need to be sitting down on my bed
do not have broken bones but I'm weirdly
pull all the ligaments up on the right
lower leg and I have no clue what my
favorite risk is maybe definitely out of
it so funny it always gives a good
tomorrow to amaze me the Christmas
spirit and a certified people is a
magical West End musical coming out of
there and I'm deathly going to see their
favorite Justin Bieber slow apps so many
if I have to say what do you mean it's
pretty pretty aren't they otherwise I
might disclose of I have to get off the
dance and go do my thing and always
adjusted sometime I love each other
raincoat when I'm sad down I was this to
it it doesn't make me feel sad and down
into spaces or happier if you can show
you having to sell something or put it
up in this room really you might be
loved because the third thing that
popped into my head was to tell myself
not to look worn eyeliner now a couple
word pages of be when I was a bit
younger when I was like 12
I should've practiced potions identity
without whoa the thing I was so bad like
you just said like I had three rubbish
black eyeshadow to my eyes so if I have
seen my little self I think it would
gently be nice after don't do my NR and
that's you've polished your mum what do
you think that severe really take in her
opinion and you know get some practice
before Apple could you just really need
to practice when using the eyeliner and
it's one thing that I still find right
now I line out although I definitely
itself improved a lot or I really hope
developers these old folks in these
edges or do popping Mina Island iced tea
or more think what is my favorite
youtuber
