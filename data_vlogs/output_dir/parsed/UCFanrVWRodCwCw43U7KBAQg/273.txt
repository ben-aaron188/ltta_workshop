hey hey so today as you know I am doing
a full haul for you guys so I'm super
excited to show you what I brought over
the past month I hope you enjoy this
video and let's get on to it so I'm
gonna start off with less things that I
can try on like socks and slippers and
them kind of self economy trial you guys
and then I will try it on the other
stuff that I have got when I have been
showing okay so we all know I absolutely
love both the good works and it's really
really sad that they don't have one here
in England I don't quite know how they
haven't understood that every person
once I bought the body works here in
England it's so amazing it's better than
anybody shot that I've ever been to
I love it and my auntie was over there a
couple of weeks ago and I also should
get his bits from there
and these were candles now pumpkin pecan
waffle candles and a vanilla pumpkin
much metal
now I remember try this before have you
can try them in the shop they just
sounded really nice the pumpkin to me
sounded really automate and the vanilla
it also helped open it as well today's
and waffles of course I got that as well
when I opened up beeps one here this is
my favorite one the lawful wife
honestly it was the most amazing thing
because you know when it is so much
better than what you expect anyway I was
expecting it to be good but not this
good oh my god every friend I share this
to handle it she like we're going to
need to so that way
it is the best now I've ever sung it
just smells like loads of food and yummy
food like candy floss marshmallows
waffles pancakes all in one and it's
such a strong smell as well so it
doesn't waste a lot easy this was $12.54
tumblers 50 as well although a second
twenty-four dollars for two
it's not my job but you know every penny
counts second when I got this vanilla
pumpkin marshmallows I love this as well
I don't know why I was thinking because
then you can actually smell it don't
need it
yeah I know this one as well it's not as
good as the other one in my opinion
although all my friends who love it I
still do not this one but if you're
stuck choosing between which one you
want then I would go through this one
because I'm all that sweet person if I
were into Primark and Mike little
business to just get some fluffy socks
and so I've got these keeping your mouth
on
I just love Disney baby I love
Disneyland it's just so much cool and I
just find Minnie Mouse a cute so I
remarked and these were to also cut some
more fluffy socks now these were five
have before they have a different prior
to having like in light pains and then a
darker pink multicolored one were there
as well I only have it in blue but yeah
what about my pink so I wanted the room
white and made the ugly but of
everything and I just love the soft and
this wonderful panel I really recommend
because they are so copied these were
two pounds for Primark
this was also from Primark and this is a
plain basic gray top and this was troll
cars everything I'm going to show you is
probably gonna be black white and grey
because when it comes to winter all the
jumpers I like are always really simple
and I just do my makeup quite fancy or
well write lipstick or bright now on
edge is where I put like this orange
ecor1 on at the moment and if you wanna
make is it's
revlon it's like you read from about pen
it's sick and they are amazing use of
time today yeah I got this I'm this is
because it has it on the side here now
all I do is I tend to have a bun done as
I waited by the man down
moving on to okay so I always tend to
buy a pair of Converse when it comes to
intellect every single year the order to
me wintertime and this is because
Fukuoka versus this is the cause and I
always find that compost might never
already got a fashion they're always in
fashion and their high trainers rather
than to those trainers which I prefer
for the winter autumn time and convert
slow with everything and so I just put
eat plain wetlands where these are the
numerals that have just come out rather
than having the red they're plain white
images no wonder how I love you so much
I really just got this because they are
a bit different to normal converse but I
really really like them and right from
first over everything
why is well was everything so these are
definitely a good buy how much of these
I do not even know the shoes were sixty
pounds
I remember now which is like the average
price and trainer so they learnt to
barometer I am obsessed with boohoo
especially when it comes to the autumn
to tighten the poncho this is because I
find blue hat this is because view has a
this is because at one boob has what I
can't even say what boo boo boo boo boo
this is because I find boo boo has a lot
of basic stuff and boo boo started cheap
store when it comes to an autumn time
but I do want basic just jumpers
things I could just tracker on and lay
out there that is a rest or like in my
opinion and this
really really cute cardigan I kind of
live with hope kind of thing we love
this so much I put it up it straight
away it's just because it has like all
the ruffles that go down so it's quite
simple classroom but then it has that
meets every two throws its black there
as well I think is about myself and the
sleeves are automatically rolled up as
well which I think are really nice and
the thing is with this as well it's
super super thick so what I wear I
definitely don't get cold I think it is
around thirty pounds obviously I'm gonna
put everything that I brought anything
below so you can just click on a link
and it will just pink now with the price
under store this I also got from Martha
Body Works I really forgot what this is
a body lotion probably works and it is
much relatable and it is marshmallow
pumpkin latte which is the same smell of
a spray that I have loved which is why I
got the body lotion as you know
emanating it dry and then we did to get
some lotion and so I thought why don't
get some from bottling works as it's my
favorite okay so my favorite item of
clothing I've got in the past cover
month it's this Champa yeah I don't know
what it is I just love it so so so so
much and it is so soft like I could just
stroke it like it's ever so snuggly and
thick and it's so nice to promote
anything like jeans or leggings or
whatever you and I win obviously and but
I just love you so much
and it actually says O'Brien California
September 1985 and this was from Topshop
it's marked the site I have it in in
Spanish size 8 and it's quite it's a
listener like this long jumper it's
about a jumper which is why I prefer a
more subtly and CA this is from Topshop
and another it's so so much
also the jump I'm wearing right now is
from Topshop as well and forth at the
same time I got the other time part so
this isn't a full of of mine and it's
also really plain and simple but it has
that these slits inside of the jumper
which like I said the government had the
zips in the side of the jumper that's
the reason why I love jumpers like this
because they are simple but then they
have something a bit different and I've
actually got this in a size 12 which is
definitely not my size but I'd love to
have big jumpers and this is the most V
quite a short jumper so I'm going to
super big and at the moment I'm ready to
throw me my socks where and the shores
of course go obviously you can wear
anything that you want to work with you
don't have oversized I just love I do
know who I said no no back to this is
another plane flew through number of
course but it has these aside and I have
them open just because it's home ferret
as I've said after these had arrived at
my house I went into Primark I saw
nearly he is that same thing and this
another dumb part is about the side
which is that and also I have it I'm
done
there's not much difference in need at
all although I definitely do prefer my
blue one because the texture on it it's
a lot thicker and comfortable another
favorite of mine and these I am obsessed
with and they wasn't too much and I have
won them so many times already and I
have had them a week well I just love
them so so much and I've worn them so so
much yes with some high need higher
opening boots and these are from silly
shoes these were 27 pounds and these
here I heard just so so beautiful and I
will show it back on and if you follow
my Instagram receipt then like honors I
have worn them a lot of times cuz I'd
often sumup and it really breaks up an
outfit like I think it outfits super
boring and iWeb leaves like the whole
outfit become so much nicer for example
if I work with the job I'm wearing now
it just make this outfit so much nicer I
make any after that I going out like if
you want to I sleep vaccine and you just
put on these boots and something that's
fancy just that so what was dressing
know you can buy them casually as well
although I do work interesting
the also boot size about this before
they have a really thin here which I'm
not ready what I do not do but I can't
really walk in stuff like that so these
boots are perfect spies my heels are
super thick so this is in love ok so my
final item and this is the Naked 2
palette now you will find the toilet
in my one of my recent videos I couldn't
decide between the naked to the naked 3
palette they have very different colors
this one is a more of an autumn color
now this is why I ended up choosing this
and so do tend to run more goals and
stuff as well although have to cut
Wednesday yeah it's very very bruised I
didn't use is really use it was very
expensive but it was totally worth the
money I am so happy with my decision
although ivory everything we're getting
2/3 as well so that will probably feed
another purpose of mine that you can use
in an alcohol or I dunno whenever for
grow soon I love this so so much and
this was 38 pounds from devlins and I'm
just totally obsessed my favorite color
is half-baked so if you have this and
use hot baby
and it's amazing then I actually agree
with you so that's it for this year I
really hope you guys enjoyed this video

itunes actually be looking at my items
