Haemon how are you so it's October now
Wow I think when I process it will be
October I'm not really that sure end of
September or October I am so excited for
October and by autumn stuff and I've
already gone like full shopping like mad
like got some jumpers and stuff but I'm
going to include that on my next
favorites because I'm hoping to do a
favorites every month but these are my
September favorites so this video is
actually a collab with Eve Bennett and
her videos I love so much
I'm absolutely obsessed so I'm really
happy to do this club with her her video
went on last Saturday so if you haven't
already go check cut out because myself
would have really similar taste so I
think you will love her video just as
much as I do okay so I'm gonna start off
with my beauty favorites as I would say
I have more Beauty favorites than any
other favorites here so let's get
started
the Ilima scar I think that's how you
pronounce it I'm not actually too sure
now the one piece of makeup that I'm not
good at like I'm really really bad at
doing its eyeliner I have never ever
been able to do it right I don't know I
haven't got a steady hand and I just it
goes too thick or it goes too thin
it just never ever goes right until I've
got this in the scar I think that's how
you pronounce it again this is like a
foul tip it literally is a foul tip it's
so easy to put on my eye like it takes
me about 10 seconds to do my eyeliner
now and I feel so empty not wearing
eyeliner now I think I love it so much
so much times but I do know it so much
so I definitely recommend this this is
amazing and if you haven't got a very
steady hand like myself this is so good
so these I actually got sent by Revlon
and I'm loving these lipsticks so much
but before I go on to these lipsticks I
just want to say because so many people
asked in my latest video which is my Q&A
what lipstick I was wearing and I'm
actually wearing the same one today and
that is Lady danger by Mac it's so
bright red it's a great color coming in
for all-time Christmas it's just like I
really
shut up because it's so bright so yeah
so these I got them from Revlon and what
I love about these is I haven't actually
used them that much of any use in like
two times so they're really really look
branding but they're like a pencil like
my eyeliner that I said it's so easy to
put on it literally is like foul tips
I'm having this whole in this but
these are like autumn colors these are
ones that I work quite a lot I don't
normally even wear bright that much but
it's just recently I've got into the
bright red-orange but these are like the
colors that I work quite a lot and this
one here is the shade fierce redoubtable
265 I think that's how you pronounce it
and this is such a nice color it's
really really dark but I think I'll be
wearing it a lot so this is a lighter
color which I might even put over the
top of that why this is actually 255 and
this is a really really nice color and
also 270 yeah so they're so nice and
this one here see I've don't really
normally wear pink so I haven't actually
tried this yet but I'm definitely gonna
try and I will let you guys know what I
think of it it's not really my color
it's more like a purpley color but I do
think it would be really really cute
I've just got to find the right outfit
and makeup to suit the lipstick if that
makes sense because I'm not really a
pinky color but I think it would look
super cute so once you've got all this
makeup on at the end of the day you're
gonna need to take it off so this is
amazing and this is the Garnier
cleansing water now normally I use
spaceflights oh my gosh script where
normally I use face wipes and they're
known as a face wash but with this all
you have to use is this all you need to
do it is you get a piece of cotton wool
and you put a little bit on it you have
all around your face and all your makeup
will come off including your mascara
eyeliner anything it feels like you've
got nothing on your face it's got no
smell it's not oily it obviously feels
that you've got water on your face it
feels like nothing and it's super quick
and easy before you go to bed so yeah I
use it so much this is definitely one of
my absolute favorites and the good thing
with this as well it has lasted me so
long honestly I can't even remember
but how long I've had this for I've got
this from boots and it was about four
pounds so it was an expensive Eva and
it's way cheaper than buying loads of
packets of whites all the time or
different based options so I love this a
lot this is a recently new pallet I got
in fact really really new this is from
accessorize and today I'm actually
wearing this white color here which I
love so much I kind of just put it in
the corner of my eyes and then this one
on top of my white shade and so yeah I'm
loving these two colors so much and I
would wear all of these colors because
they are really subtle all to me colors
when you normally get panicked so like
there's three that you're like and
there's like two that you don't so like
it's kind of a waste of money you just
think you can buy them individually
somewhere else but all these colors I
love all of them at so yeah I'll be
using them unlocked and it was only six
pounds so it's definitely worth the
money my favorite all-time spray now
this is the marshmallow pumpkin latte
and this is from Bath and Body Works and
in another one of my videos I also
showed you a different spray from Bath
and Body Works but a Bath & Body Works
is one of my favorites even though we
don't have it in the UK but I just want
to go online shopping and buy loads of
stuff from there because I love it so
much and this spray I have never ever
smelled a spray so amazing and it has
lasted me so long I've had it for months
and only the tiniest bit is gone it
basically just smells like well it's
called marshmallow but it just smells
like I'm eating marshmallows all the
time because it's so strong basically I
just feel like a marshmallow when I'm
wearing this I love much Miller it's so
this literally is the best frame just
smell like a cake and it just smells so
yummy so yeah I recommend this it's so
so nice it's $14 but I think is if you
buy three you get like a deal but I
can't remember what it is because I got
at common months ago but I'm definitely
gonna go online gonna get the same kind
as this because I love the smell so
yeah so my next product I've had for
about five days now and this product I
didn't order no a lot of it for me I do
not know how I've got it have no clue
how much it is I just got a delivery at
my door for my name and I was like I
haven't ordered anything so I open this
box really cool is and this came out
with another like skincare product and I
was really really confused but there's
no way I've ordered this but anyway I've
actually been using it a lot and it
smells amazing and I don't even know how
to pronounce this
I love mean I love mine I have no clue
but all I can say is it smells amazing I
think it's the pumpkin I'm loving at the
moment because it's really vanilla rate
rather than my have a face wash which is
like water this is more like the scrub
so if I want to scrub like in between my
pores like brand my nose and stuff then
this is one I definitely recommend I did
google it so they do have a lot more
product and it is really really nice
don't know how much is because I didn't
actually pay for it I just somehow got
sent it to my house
but yeah I'm loving this so thank you
whoever you are said this to me is much
appreciative because I will be using
this a lot so the next thing I'm loving
for this month is please naked bye bye
cornered now I'm in love with naked bars
they were one of my favorite things
they're super super healthy they don't
like cut any like added sugar or
anything it's all completely natural and
then I discovered please that this month
and these are like little bites of them
but these have different flavors like
the fruit salad I've never seen in a bar
off and these strawberries and cream
I've never known about either and yeah
these are so nice and they kind of last
longer because they're in little bites
and it closed it if you like
you eat in the packet of chocolate
though these only have three ingredients
in them this is
we're days cashews and raisins rice
flavor and natural flavoring they're
down now if I heard that I would think
I'm not trying that because that's
doesn't mean you sound great but
honestly it's so much lighter than it
sounds and I think this one has a saying
yeah they all have the same stuff and
then it just has like flavoring in taste
my stuff so these are something I
definitely recommend if you haven't
tried them and they're super help also
wheat dairy and gluten free and these
are super yummy so if you haven't
already go try it beads trust me they
are nicer than they sound these are what
these would look like little chocolate
balls
well they don't they're not chocolate
played it with chocolate balls and they
are so so good so and these are
something you want to try go try them
I've got an event coming up next month I
think it's the end of next month and I
wanted to make my outfit look quite
stylish
and so I found the perfect thing in
Topshop that as soon as I found it I
fell in love with it straight away and
to be honest at first I didn't think
I'll be able to pull this off but
actually it goes with anything and it
can make any art Philip stylish and I
think it's really in this season it was
quite expensive it was 25 pounds but
it's definitely working investment
because I know I will use it so much so
it kind of looks weird now because all
my hair is taut behind that yeah this is
the Hat and I love it a lot so autumn is
coming and so therefore I needed an
autumn jacket I found this super cute
one in Topshop and I love it a lot I
can't use just basically it's just a
denim jacket I'm not dead in it this is
black denim and it has a fur line that
goes the whole way through it so it's
super comfortable it's not too cold to
wear a really really thick jacket so
this is kind of in between or to me
because of minica for a quarter jacket
and this is from Topshop
and it was fifty pounds I usually spend
more on a jacket because obviously
you've got to get a little wear out
there and it has to last you a long time
so this is one I've been
a lot and I'm loving for autumn it's so
my next favorite I had for very very
long time go to at Christmastime but
then I kind of forgot about it because I
didn't have enough films to put inside a
bit for it to work so I just got really
lazy and didn't go out and get more then
I just never ended up music here and
then I found it in my drawer again and
this is my Polaroid now this I got from
Urban Outfitters and the PO noise itself
is a very expensive I think it's like 45
pounds but the film's are quite
expensive so I don't use it too often I
just use it like at special times this
is one that I've used ages ago so this
was like last year and then I've got
what me and Jake found it together so
this is a picture of me and Jake that we
took called the Polaroids that you might
sort on my snapchat if you follow me on
there or if you follow me on my
Instagram which obviously will be knit
below and then sort of straights little
self either actually it wasn't a selfie
cuz I do cut off him yeah this is
definitely my favorite so basically I'm
just gonna take a selfie so I could show
you guys how cool this is and how it
works so literally I click this button
prick to open and then I click this you
need annoying thing is you can't see
what you're taking zip it bad well it's
bad just about a selfie and or when it
is about too old for you for me to say
so it's new to me like that that's all
you have to do then the picture comes
out and then when it's out you give it a
shake and in kind of a jam is really
sucked about picture I could just towel
and very go the Amazon this is my
Polaroid picture it isn't the best
because you know you only get one tank
but in a way is more memorable with it
it's one take I do like it there is one
thing I probably would prefer if I could
sit there and choose which photo but
yeah I don't my photos and if you
haven't got one they're really really
cool so go get one because they're not
even that expensive as well this is not
necessarily what is kind of my favorite
this month but it has been my favorite
for a very very long time but then
I didn't have it for a long time this is
the lady million perfume and honestly I
can't sit here and try and explain what
the smell is because I will just make up
loads of rubbish because honestly I have
no clue what that smell is
but this is my favorite or what time
perfume it's so strong it lasts so long
and every time I wear it somebody always
asks what smell it is and so if I ever
meet you guys or ever and you're
thinking I smell nice it's probably this
because this perfume is amazing actually
comes with a lotion which I want when
you say it is my favorite but it smells
like this so yes I don't think a lot
definitely recommend it if you're
looking for a perfume definitely get an
80 million it is so nice and it smells
gorgeous oh you can get this lady
million perfume from probably most
places but I actually got my from
fragrance direct which I will link to
the website below and this is the core
so I don't have to go out and get it I'd
let you just ordered it online super
easy super quick and it was cheaper my
final favorite of this month and this is
really really simple and my best friend
Georgia bought it for me
and this dress is an S Richard and this
was from necks don't actually know how
much it is but she works for me and it
hasn't come out I'm not sure here yes
this was 10 pounds but I'm redoing a
room downstairs which I can have this
like a backdrop for you guys because I
want to have the same backdrop but most
of the time and then I'm just gonna
change up a bit and so this will
definitely be there and it's just black
and white so it basically goes with my
room and it will go with my backup
dancers too and of course it's an S for
that one for me so I hope you guys have
enjoyed my favorites of this month and
