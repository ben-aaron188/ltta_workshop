you
you
hi guys so I'm in America right now as
some of you guys may know from vlogs
that I put on in the past and I have
been shopping loads as it is just my
birthday so I've had money I don't have
any more but I did have money and I
spent it all good good stuff that I love
and so some of you guys have asked me if
they could see this stuff so I thought
why not do an American haul version I
went to was - for our - or for I'm
looking for some brushes the first brush
I bought was this one here it's actually
a contour brush because I've been
looking for a contour brush but the
second I saw this brush before I'd like
even like tried using it because there
was some that you could use in the shop
I was like oh my god I need that because
it just looked so cool I don't know if
you can see here because it has the
packaging on but the shape of the brush
kind of bends in like your cheek bone
shape so when I put it on of my face it
would literally give me such a good to
highlight and contour the way it sits on
my legs if that makes sense so I love
this I haven't used it yet but another
and the next brush I got was like a
thick brush it's so yeah it refreshes
itself the individual brush is already
thick it's actually a bronzer brush but
I'm going to use it as like a foundation
brush that I'll mix in my foundation as
it's really thick so I'm going to use it
as both and I hope it's good because
that's what I actually need are doing so
Sephora we went to my favorite shop ever
which it is Victoria's Secret and
Victoria Secret pink and I got a nice
big bag okay so the first thing I got
here this white jumper it's quite plain
at the front but the back it has like a
hood and an absolutely love jump that
have clips at the moment if I have like
one from Hot Mess which is like a mesh
jump on it has expression at the back as
well and I wear that a lot and a lot of
people ask where I've got that from that
is from hotman
and this is kind of recent oh my god
like as I'm in America right now it's
really hot on sunny today so yeah we
what pass the bikini section but
obviously I can actually walk past
conception because a term an ingenious
way credible I got was this black and
Victoria Secrets bikini I absolutely
love it because I love the elastic it
has on the bottom and it has two elastic
straps on the back
the good thing with black if you don't
really have to have a tan to ever that
which is kind of myself because I'm not
in the Sun and we don't have any Sun of
England so this is one I will wear a lot
and then obviously I bought these match
in bikinis bikinis and matching bikini
bottoms that I love as well they're like
they're called change bottoms and they
also have the elastic love love loves I
couldn't resist was this
this bikini that is black it's the same
fitting as the other one it's mesh and I
absolutely love mesh as I said I do have
a mesh jumper and have so many other
more or less but is like see-through
mesh at the back and at the front
obviously it has clear white because you
don't want to be see-through really
really nice fitting as well
and then obviously I got the kini
buttons to them as well I absolutely
love and then finally I got an extra
pair of kini bottoms just because I
absolutely love these it's like I love
these so much I love the elastic at the
top I think they're so nice oh I'm
they're really comfy and the elastic is
really comfy yeah good thing with these
as well is well they didn't have top of
it that's partly why I just got the
bottoms but I got the bottoms as well
because it's white and black it can kind
of both anything in her hello from green
playing top it will match and like also
even with the white mesh one it will go
really really so I thought about from
forever 21 and just all so much I'm
going to say in therapy shop basically
every shop repair shop but no seriously
Victoria Secret is everyone are my
favorite shop I love forever 21 because
surprises are really reasonable I think
forever 21 to me reminds me of hmm but
better clothes but like hnoms were
unreasonable as well back jumper I
thought why she is a crop top it says on
it cool yes it says a knit top so it's
to me it's like it when it is a pop top
but it's really really thick material so
it's like a drum part that makes sense
like a crop jump part of the material on
it it's really really nice feel
especially when you wear it's like a
knot it key at all and has the dip at
the map
like this is probably one of my favorite
tops I fall here so far just because
it's so plain but it's so comfortable
and it's like you know you got to Eve
like you know you go out like in the
evening and then like it's sunny when
you go out with a mineral short to wear
because I feel in an evening get that
windy and chilly this is probably
something I would wear because it's kind
of in-between it's a throught the top
but it's thick like the jumper so I
would probably wear that quite a lot
like when I got I got this Lake obsessed
that I absolutely love which is really
really Chris right now which doesn't
look great
but no I absolutely love this I wear
this all the time just partly because
they're so comfortable I don't know they
just magically they look cool basically
but there's ample a kiss vest I actually
got for $9.99 in the sale so I did one
side the other for everyone yeah so this
was really really good price I think
they still have their online on it it's
also in the sale so I will put the link
below it when I see Victoria Secrets I
have to buy something akin there here we
are actually no this was this was the
same more as that Vuitton secret it was
the same shop what happened with this is
basically walks in this bag I've spotted
on the internet about three months to go
now and I saw this one and I was like oh
my god I have to get off so I went over
to London Victoria Secret and I looked
everywhere are some people in the shop
do they have it and I was like oh no we
don't sell it anymore so I was really
hoping to find it in America and then I
looked round in the first pictures live
in the first victoria's secret shop and
i couldn't find it anywhere and i paid
for everything but i just bought all
that luck goodness behind me and then
seconds after I bought it I had found I
found it it's absolutely amazing makeup
bag but I love so simple I love it so
much so I queued another half an hour
line
but it's so worth it stop and use it a
lot actually I probably won't use it a
lot because with me it was get really
dirty because it's see-through but a
little like new me I'll buy I probably
put it in this notoriously Chris bag and
I love the fact you see through that you
can see what's inside of it but I just
hope it doesn't get dirty too much but
this was $24 and they have it on the
side still and they have a different
size of the hallux small sizes and they
also have in a light pink so I think I
might put oh my goodness I have to
include this I know everything by bought
so far is like makeup or clothes include
this because we went to Walmart and I
saw this minion this minion would you
will sharpen a petition up three three
in one I just fell in love because it's
so cute
and I'm just gonna buy it no matter what
it smelt like but it looks so cute I
know it looks so cute on my bath inside
I think it was like three dollars or
something and it smells incredible it's
like there's a strawberry and banana
scented but it smells like cotton candy
my god
Sookie what yes so this is what I got
from loom ops and I loved it so much
then we went to the addi gas outlet
store which they call over in America a
DDoS or something weird like that which
doesn't make sense to me because it's
good a DDoS but I went to a DDoS app and
I bought another nest because other tip
before
I actively love that stuff of the phone
I so can't be enough chilling in
and if you know me I absolutely love
likes late friend and let the cream so
when I saw this first I've thin snake
friend and luckily I just bought some
audacity for stars that have sneaked
print out the back as well so they're
going to go really nice together then
what a surprise I went back to another
pink because I couldn't resist walking
past it and I got another bag oh
goodness
so the first thing ping crop-top
were actually top pink but you know yes
it's from pink so I'm playing its cocky
green and I absolutely love the color
card 3 I just think it's a really cool
color and I love the elastic at the
bottom as here like the bikinis and it
has like the elastic looking fringe at
the back so it kind of looked like that
although it isn't but yeah I like to cut
outside I would probably wear this croc
drop and to somewhere like the gym as
its I lock the elastic at the bottom I
liked for like things like the gym
because it's comfy you can move around
in a lot but you can also wear this croc
drop out I probably would wear it out
because I'm wearing it to the gym I went
both ways if I had another one different
color probably most likely wear out this
was $26.95 up there next thing I brought
was these burgundy pajama shorts that I
love they're just really simple they
just have the word pink all over and I
think they were like $22 I got to the
tear on the lady was like Oh
Johanna try a new pink spray and I was
like hmm not really only spray anyway
she sprayed it and I fell in love pink
mini spray but you can get them in
bigger sizes as well this is the hot
crush but the smell of it is absolutely
amazing like it's so summery and I love
like wearing the stuff too summery like
I love like pink at the moment of floral
that's why I come wearing like a
Coralie lipstick right now because I
just like to feel with it because I love
the summer so much I'd like to feel as
if I'm going sister dedicating myself
yes so I got this spray because I love
it so much and it's really summery
it's like has a very crushed caramel
smell as in it's got totally crush
worthy in Jasmine I'm going caramel so
it's really nice like I recommend this
big time I pick time you need it in your
life if you don't have this and the good
thing with this as well as you can get
it from any Victoria Secrets pink store
so they have it basically anywhere and
they have other like smells as well ice
like a light pink one that I tried on
and I'm definitely getting it the next
when I go with this one as well I've had
it two days and it nearly quarter gone
and we only have like a week left in
America so I'm definitely gonna get more
and if I do another haul you'll probably
see that I probably have loads of them
in the back right now
I got told I was getting the free is it
true secrets bad and I actually love
this one go and buy it
and then I got told I can get it for
free if I spend so much and I can spend
quite a lot so I did get for free and
this time it's so big as well so I'm
probably going to take it to someone
like the feet chest I got in my big huge
throughout their bag inside
and if you follow me on stuff like
Instagram you'll know that I'm warehouse
a lot whether they're like snapback or
caps I will add them all quite a lot
just because I love accessorizing and I
have really got many accessories on now
because I've just kind of been chilling
all day but I love accessorizing when I
go out and I think hats like a really
good thing to wear that I love the color
pink as you can tell I love pink and I
love shopping and I've everything pink
so I've got this super cute Ralph Koran
hat that was from the outlet store so it
was cheaper than it normally would be
and I think it was $30 I've got a really
really simple jumper
it's paying around it I've got it in a
medium size so I got it like extra big
for me so I can wear it around the house
with like just leggings or something
simple because like with jumpers I just
like them to be comfy I'm not too
bothered on the look whether I would if
I was to wear that out I probably would
work leggings not jeans because it will
be really baggy
probably over my knees his awesome just
a mouthful around white and pink train
socks because I've absolutely that's for
a friend when I said I love hooded stuff
so much and I know Jay does as well so I
got him this jumping up from Ralph
Lauren it's like just plain gray as well
and it really needs iron in and it has
up the plane ready to round around Simon
laughs but it has the hood on the back
so I just think it's a really cool
jumper
I love jumble with hoods and I know
they've done as well because they're
just really that's what I've got in
Ralph Lauren and that's actually the
final thing I've got here too so far so
