hello you lovely bunch of people hello
if you're new here if it's the first
time you ever see me in the screen make
sure to subscribe down below contouring
family this is that to your new backdrop
for me I've never put a video here
before and I tell you what I'm feeling
it this is my new office in the house
and it's so true I could not make you
guys to see if you follow the vlogs you
would have seen like little sneak peeks
and stuff off the office so you would've
actually see in the whole office because
it's not completely done yet that's why
I'm in their little corner buried right
now yeah make sure you're following the
bus as well because there definitely
will be doing office told I found a lot
of videos buying things from the website
which and you guys really seem to enjoy
them because it's super cheap and I'm
just like you know moving around the
other day on which and I saw like loads
of like shoots or like fake designer
stuff whatever you guys want to call it
and I thought you know what be really
cool to compare against the real design
stuff but like the truth version or the
fake designer stuff to see is actually
really worth the money anyway that's my
dish so I hope you guys do during the
video so much a big thumbs up if you
guys did subscribe to up a life and
without further ado let's get into
clicks onto this video you would have
seen how much the actual designer stuff
is and the Fate designer stuff is for
the designers stuff it costs four
thousand two hundred and fifty pounds
which breaks my heart a little bit
because that is an excessive amount for
one outfit like that is so much money
and then the cheap version the wish
version cause 39-count 20p obviously
it's a lot more affordable that is a
huge difference so I am praying that I
like dupes are more than the design
stuff because honesty some of the stuff
is actually my facade where I've just
ordered for this video I have a feeling
my mom's gonna definitely make sure I
send it back we're gonna start with the
t-shirt so this is a Balmain tisha this
is the actual bow main t-shirt that's
bought from the store it's really really
really good quality has that
stick buttons against Rako 20 and is on
most of the things from Balmain i think
this is so nice obviously it has their
main parents going across it in like a
really nice gold it was really good
quality so it doesn't feel like if you
put it in the wash it's all just going
to come off now I know this is a lot of
money for a t-shirt I think it was 180
pounds a lot of people were clones then
that sort of money I t-shirt however I'm
more likely to spend money like what a
designer tisha because you could just
rock it in the pair of Primark jeans and
it would look really cool and you can
you know where it would pretty much
anything I love this t-shirt obviously
it's very pricey and then if I bought
the exact same thing from wish so here's
the pit start of what walk from wish and
yeah it's what I got
it has Gildan on it it doesn't even say
Balmain this is bowling this is
definitely not why I ordered I mean the
teacher itself actually feels like it's
quite good quality but it just it
doesn't even say foul made on it it says
bullet so this isn't is actually the
best cheap to start us off with this is
actually fraud like there happens given
me wife actually ball and I could have
gone to apprentice or done this myself
no I know it doesn't have the buck it
didn't have the buttons in the picture
so I wasn't expecting that but the fact
it says something completely different
I'm a little bit disappointed to be
honest and I don't think it would work
so I'm not a massive fan because I think
it it looks like it's trying to be
Balmain but it's completely not so I
want to say this has got a thumbs down
let's see what we have next I'm really
hoping I like the rest of the outfit I
don't want to be too judging when it
comes to the shoes and I actually got
some Gucci trainers I think these are
really popular I know so many people
have these key is that the real version
of the Gucci trainers is supported from
the store I all of these for the purpose
of the video and then probably going
straight back as sad as it is the box
obviously is absolutely stunning you
expect to have a box like this when you
pay 450 pounds of a trainer
also coming in their own little dust
bags which is obviously what you're also
paying for so cute so these are the
Gucci trainers now I got those with
flowers will open them which one is
actually I'm not a massive fan I don't
really like this flower pattern but I do
like the shoe overall they obviously
just let her trainers my love the bat
folks obviously it has the metallic on a
I think that's really pretty
Thank You Chi always has one shoe at the
back green and then the others right so
let me just show you the other food
today go those the back of the shoes
right let's give the wish version a look
good focus bags like this is a group
your package in my shoes I thought they
were nice and safe in here and how I can
see the shoe is really good like the
print on that is actually really nice at
the back it obviously doesn't have the
bows that the other one did I have
honestly amazed so I think this is
amazing 13 pounds they've pretty much
got everything that there's like actual
designer Gucci shoe doesn't only have
only thing is though just looking at it
they don't have the red and green on the
back they just have red on the back but
still in like they're so pretty and they
obviously have that like metallic color
as well honest I just don't even ought
to say like I'm genuinely amazed now I
was like put them up side to side
against each other you can see the
comparison now obviously the actual
Gucci trainer on the bottom there's like
a little bit more detail but still I'm
just blown away by how amazing this Jeep
is now you can see how everybody GU
tears of it like that is mental yeah I
think if you can't afford or don't want
to spend the amount of money for Gucci
trainers go to which because these are
13 pounds and then they're grown the
only thing though that I'm a little bit
confused about is
five six and both of these are in a size
six and like look how much bigger the
actual Gucci trainer is and I have no
idea why they look huge that definitely
got me excited let's move on and see
what the next is like this is the most
exciting part for me it should now
handbags I don't know one I wish I owned
one
now this is a lot of money I think this
is about three thousand pounds which I
know is absolutely mental it's a lot of
money
it's a Chanel boy bag pops air boy range
it's absolutely beautiful
I am so obsessed with there is
everything I've ever wanted in a bag and
it's not mine
no open it up you kind of like click
this together and then it's got my the
lovely pocket I don't know if you guys
can see and it's like suede inside it's
a super pretty obviously the quality of
this bag is amazing you wouldn't expect
anything less it has to be perfect when
you're spending three thousand pound on
that however I do feel like even though
it's so much money and I know a lot of
people will be thinking that is an
excessive amount to spend on the bag and
now I know a lot people will be thinking
like three thousand pounds like so much
money and I know it is but you kind of
feel like these bags are an investment
because if you don't really do look
after it and then they don't really lose
their value and if you have it for like
quite a long time and you keep it in
really good condition it cannot you can
go up in value and however I'm not
always the best when it comes to lengthy
ask for things I'm just quite clumsy and
I just throw things yeah so hopefully
the wish walk will be more practical min
so this is the which version you know I
did order in a different color
oh because I didn't see in a bracelet
let's have a little faster I do actually
think this looks really good
now from a distance I feel like you
wouldn't be able to notice that much of
a difference until you've got up close
so I do think the bag is but obviously I
think in the bag is really nice because
it's designed to look like it should out
and I just love Chanel bags in general
now when you hold your real leather
Chanel bag the leather is so so so soft
and it feels amazing in this very heavy
however it feels completely different
this obviously is like plastic so it's a
bit weeds smells very good as well but
yeah it does look really good
now this here at this buckle you think
it looks like you you know how I said
you kind of like push it in and then the
back opens its kind of looks ugly though
that was an actually twist but the fact
it looks like it does I think is really
good I learn a few since oh okay it
comes with this it it comes with the
longer strap than their handle which is
nice because obviously this is what the
real bag comes with and so that's really
good so this was ten pounds and
Twitter's actually got one pound 20 off
because I don't know if you guys ever
shopped from which it's a very weird
store but if you buy at the same time
someone else you get money off that's
how I did and I've got one pound 20 off
this bag which is great you know saving
the dollar in photos I imagine you can
easily get away with this being the real
Chanel bag obviously I'm going to show
you guys what about the outfits that
like at the end submission stick around
the Gucci balance so this is
a real Gucci bout of the seat from the
action to sign up this is actually my
brother's sippin everyone's clothes for
this but this wood it looks like it
always has like a double Chi there
really really really nice obviously can
get those different styles he's
obviously got on that black but you have
yet gold at the end obviously the actual
about this world can be like loads of
different and designs and stuff I tried
to pick the one that was most similar
this one here it's a black saddle and it
has the gold Chi which they don't
actually do know obviously have just
showed you guys they have micro GG so
Gucci as far as I'm aware definitely
don't do a single gene but like if
you're really into fashion that much I
don't even think you would notice and
honestly I think the bout is actually so
nice that like I really want and it was
like trying to be a dupe or like a fake
Gucci belt because actually because it's
so nice alone so this belt was six
pounds you can't really complain I mean
the gold would just like really shiny in
general like it's going to come off so
yeah I would actually wear this a my
life is about when I came to jeans I
wasn't really too sure really what to
get cuz nothing really was calm my
name's so I just won't leave the Levi's
cuz comedy go wrong however I don't
actually like the jeans novice in real
life but I thought I'd go for like the
mom Jean kind of style as I think
they're really cool so here is the
designer Levi's version and has like
this
tie-dye bit in the middle just kind of
cool is definitely different but one is
that it actually really like that I
realized
oh these actually are reacts okay so
that these are like meant to look like
rips but they aren't they just have the
tie-dye
so however it's all over and my patches
and stuff and that you can see actually
at the back of the leg which is really
cool but no actual rips I'm actually a
huge fan of these to be honest day I
don't know I don't know how I feel about
the dots in the member life these are
the Levi's then pair of jeans I got from
wish the wish version over here is the
wish version there's definitely less
going on but actually there's still like
the ton of rips in these trousers again
obviously I got like mum trousers so
they would look the same these rips
actually are it I actually prefer these
the quality like these are really good
students I like them a lot obviously
these are like different style but like
the quality of them is so good I
actually think if these like if these
fit me and then like I would wear these
they're really nice so I'm really hoping
they do fit me and honestly I actually
prefer these to the Levi's one so I'm
not least we've got the Christian Dior
seller sunglasses these are new and they
come in a very fancy box I really like
I'm very pretty I love it these are very
fancy I love them the hexagon shape and
that they're mirrored they're so pretty
my mom's not gonna let me keep them
which is so sad they're so cool though
the gold as well as a such a nice shiny
gold however these were about 270 pounds
and I'm gonna think about it it's a
little piece of metal for 270 pounds and
then I love not least the wish version
once again or with the hexagon shape
right so here are the wishes versions
wanna see I think I like them as me I
mean I refer these one
I love the fact that they are mirrored a
kind of by the same sort of shape and
however they are so a little bit
different this one has more sides it's
still really cool though like I actually
still really like this glasses you know
what I would actually wear these but I
would like thousand percent wear these
on holiday picture me look on the ground
it's giving rocking knees tomorrow I
think the one thing I actually wouldn't
spend a lot of money on or invest money
in is that the sunglasses because I lose
things and they're there just be so easy
to lose so I would prefer to get a cheap
hair that look nice and then buy a new
pair for a holiday so these were the
three pounds and you know what I
actually thought I love these like more
but like now I've put these on when I'm
comparing the money I'm like I'd rather
go out and buy these so anyway let's go
and see what these outfits do that like
on so this is the design an outfit this
was over 4000 pounds
so yeah just let me know your opinions
actually I've got all the anything I
don't like the jeans because they've
never saw a flattering they do not see
me but apart from that actually bring
back this outfit so this is the super
version you know what I actually really
like that is kind of inner about the top
of the seats is ball in not really fit
in that part actually really really
really like the jeans I mean again
there's sort of like that flattering
I'm loving the glasses I think they look
just as good on a see same with some of
the shoes where have you guys did enjoy
