hello everyone and welcome back to my
channel as you can see I'm a bear face
right now and I've got my big bag of
makeup ready to apply it this is
actually makeup that strangers chose me
which was so exciting and fun to film
also it's kind of like nerve-wracking at
the same time but yeah it was good
however we did end up getting kicked out
the store but you'll see that like
throughout the video that was kind of
annoying but apart from that this video
was so much fun to film I met so many
lovely people everyone felt so awkward
on camera it was great
I did actually also film a video like
this where strangers actually chose my
outfits a popsicle kinds of action goes
right in town
and you guys pretty really enjoyed that
video so if you haven't seen that I will
link it down below but I've run that
video so many of you guys asked if I
would go out and let strangers pick a
full-face so here I am but I'm gonna be
applying this and makeup to my face but
before I do let's see what happened when
I went to town watching so we're
starting off with Roy who is going to be
treated by one day to anything
okay probably the closest one yeah gonna
go finish and found that one there
that's not a foundation telling it out
yeah these are foundations it's
unfortunate that what happened
ready this one was going for yes one
this is the one guys watch out now never
try this foundation as well so thank you
so we're doing lipstick now and I'm
joined by medic la and she has decided
to choose but it sticks are you ready
I'm sailor I'm concealer actually we're
doing both on lipstick and concealer
you're going to try and find that's a
good luck you could choose anything that
you think might suit me or whatever you
think I should have okay well you know
kids get inside just with you okay you
ready yep let's go
I'm gonna pick Amazonian from nibbling
because it's one of my favorites oh yes
I do
oh nice I love the guys we've got a
really super dark for those okay okay so
I think the L'Oreal True Match concealer
in vanilla cool I've also met two other
lovely people introduce yourself
I'm Alex Brown and Alex is gonna do my
eyeshadow and here you're going to be
doing my bronzer so you ready okay okay
let's do it
that's anywhere in this shop it doesn't
matter what brand like whatever factor
below me now on yeah I like I've never
used this bronzer and I've always wanted
to try it out thank you very much Alex
is chosen
I've don't put color I want to see some
summer colors and popping yeah okay the
makeup skills are going to come out with
this palette and I'm pretty excited I
like to a choice thanks to me so
basically guys the basic basically just
got picked up why didn't we get kicked
out to drugs but oh god that was another
film in there anymore and she basically
asked that I would go ask someone in
here but I knew that I wouldn't be
allowed to film anyways long story short
I'm not allowed to go in they're not
allowed to do this video anymore and
that I did get to people would you buy
the rest my makeup
thank you to Zoe and Jenny for choosing
where's my makeup I'll show you when I'm
at home I got my souped up bag and we're
ready to go and apply this full face and
thanks everyone for being in it through
there you go everyone that was
definitely interesting as you guys would
have seen I did get kicked off store
filming but I did actually manage to get
the rest of the full face so I couldn't
actually film it unfortunately but I do
have the rest of the makeup products in
my bag chosen by strangers starting off
with foundation chosen and by Roy we've
got this foundation by a Nippon fab I've
got the shade 40 which honestly looks a
little bit too dark for me but you've
got to give Roy credit for trying
because to be fair I don't think he's
ever had to choose foundation in his
life before in fact he didn't really
know what foundation was so thanks Roy
for choosing this for me I actually love
Nippon fab I've used so many other
products before however I've never used
a foundation and I'm pretty sure I might
be wrong but I thought you have to mix
this with something but this is all
we've got
so I'm just gonna use my Beauty Blender
and just bend two in and see what
happens
right this is definitely too dark but we
can walk that way to talk
right that is blended I was gonna get I
actually matched my Beauty Blender at
the moment it's definitely too dark I
think Roy really thought I needed a tan
however I don't think any dividend this
much it's never like dark it's like
orange like a lychee like an apple and /
if you've seen Wizard of Oz you would
know one on villain Perez in fact I'll
pop one here and that's his actual at
night right now next we're moving on to
concealer this is the L'Oreal True Match
and it's in the shade I don't know I
feel like I'm very car said this on
screen and she was so lovely oh my
goodness and it's so sweet as well
because I actually found out that she
watched my videos and we had to give her
the fright of my life when I asked her
to him to be in my video it was so funny
but she was so sweet so thank you so
much I don't know how this is gonna sit
over this my nation it's quite a nice
color though I'm definitely glad that
it's quite light because hopefully we're
gonna lighten up the foundation a little
bit because the foundation is so dark
that the ceiling doesn't actually show
up that much however it was so creamy I
love the formula it blended so well and
I genuinely think I would choose I can
see like every single day like I'm so
glad I actually got the chance to try it
because this is going straight in my
makeup bag the next product is chosen by
Ram this is a bronzer again another
L'Oreal product but I do just want to
say he was so lovely and it was so
embarrassed because I'm looking back at
the footage and I'm like I actually I
didn't hear his name the first time I
didn't go so what was your name again
because I felt rude and so I introduced
him as here and I look back it and I'm
like oh my goodness it's so Barris so
embarrassing and here you're going to be
doing my once I survive if you're
watching this I'm so sorry
but thank you so much producing this
bronzer I would never forget your name
again now how I just say I know I
haven't actually use a bronzer yet but
this is so good you've got the bronzer
you've got a brush underneath
stepping on he'll open it again and then
you've got a mirror how good is that I'm
actually not going to use that brush
because I'm going to use my own brush
and you think the shade might be quite
good too but again we're going over the
foundation so I really know if we need
it to be that much darker moving order
from bronze are we going in with the
highlight this is by anyway this
actually looks like such a nice
highlight in fact actually I've used
this highlight before I know I have I
actually really like this highlight it's
really pretty I feel like it's really
buildable as well which is really nice
Brown product was chosen by Zoe so thank
you so much this is the medium to dark
broke here by Barry n dress are getting
a break here I think that's really nice
I don't like cream products personally
and I prefer using powder and but it's
really good because there's a cream
product a powder and then that's all
thought I could like to shade that you
can highlight your brows with two and so
I'm using the military which is quite
dark but I think it should be fine
because I defer my brows being darker
anyways so when I do my bra I'm
definitely not a bribe affectionate I
don't spend most of time on my brows but
when I do it I normally like outline my
browser then I kind of just fill it in
alex is looking for a very long time
when it came to palette he wanted
something that was Wow could test some
makeup skills so we got a palette right
anyway and this is their silent disco
eyeshadow palette to start off I want to
say but I've never used a yellow and
blue before so wish me good luck and
second of all we all know I'm not a
makeup artist so if you have any
comments be nice
basically write some song off with this
blue here and I'm gonna put this like on
the crease and just blend the colors are
really pretty but there like it is
really buildable which is really good
but it means it takes a long time
because the colors aren't quite what
they look on the palette that this dark
below I've had to mix of the purple
quite a bit to kind of get this darker
blue a purple color because the dark
blue alone was actually quite lie and it
took a lot of layers but I've kind of
blended the lighter one towards the top
and then I per over the lid the blue and
the purple mixed together oh and I'm now
gonna add some yellow like in the corner
but so the color doesn't like blend and
so it doesn't go green I'm gonna put
some concealer in first the problem with
this eyeshadow palette is is there so
much fullback like so much fullback and
it's so powdering in there almost like
shimmery which is pretty but it means
it's hard to kind of get like a really
strong bold color really really really
hoping that the yellow does the bulk so
that will kind of like finish the look
and so I'm going to use a concealer in
the middle of my eyes now and then put
the yellow on top
jessimae is clear not trying to do a cut
crease I'm just and I'm not actually
going halfway across Elliot I'm going my
maybe like a quarter maybe just over a
quarter
so duh my eyes finally feel like it's
literally taking forever to do this this
is the finished look my liners are a
little bit different I did basically I
kind of cheated a little bit because I
did do lineup only because I forgot to
get loaded in the store and if I have
more time and if I was allowed to film I
would have got liner and secondly with
this like with the color eyeshadow she
kind of like have to apply liner because
otherwise it would have looked so weird
it would have just there would have been
something missing so I just done minor I
just use a liner from home I use the
Rimmel exaggerated liner which is really
really really good price we're moving on
it's true in the store
this was this was chosen by Jenny as
well she she chose the eyebrows and she
chose a mascara and the mascara is
Lottie London and it's an ultra
volumizing mascara which is exactly what
I need I've never used or heard of this
mascara before but it's so cool look if
you look at the brush I like how it's
been I don't know how it's gonna work
but I like it I don't know if she's
actually uses before like if it was a
recommendation or if she just chose it
randomly
as policy lipstick I've also got my last
I've got she got me that app she also
got me lashes because you picked me up
flashes and then she picked me up the
scar and I ended up getting both which
is actually better because with this
Lima you can't even see my lashes and
last but not least we've got lipstick
Joe survived Erica and this is
Maybelline New York and this is a
recommendation
she says this is amazing so I'm very
excited I was there any web maps anymore
I'm so I'm excited to give this go oh
god that's so nice that is so nice so
everyone here is the full face of makeup
that strangers to chose for me you know
what I actually really like the makeup I
use obviously it was quite hard and to
start off with because the foundation
color I meant to be honest I've been
sitting in front of my lights that is so
hot like the heat it's like sweating off
which might not just be a bad thing
considering how dark it is I think it
turned out okay I'm considering I've
never uses colors from a palette before
but yeah as I said it's all kind of
coming off my face now which isn't great
I feel a because I didn't use a primer
as well it didn't help I hope you guys
