hi everyone and welcome back to my
channel now for today's video as you can
clearly see with the primer path behind
me I am testing out Primark new makeup
now I have tested up robots makeup
before but this was throwback to 2017
and they've had to put a new collection
which is so exciting
it's like a dupe for the k'kaw
collection so the packaging itself is a
literally beautiful like oh look how
amazing this is and it's so affordable
as well fingers crossed that this makeup
is amazing if it is like I'm gonna be so
happy honestly so I really hope you guys
do enjoy the video if you do you know
what to do smash a big thumbs up and
subscribe down below if you guys haven't
already I also do have a vlogging
channel so be sure to go and check that
out oh and one last thing I wanted to
say their new collection they've only
got some bits like they don't have a
full face of new collection so some of
the makeup I'm gonna be trying might not
be as new as this collection but it's
definitely new for me I've never tried
it out before and so hopefully it still
does helping you guys out and I really
hope you guys enjoy and let's get into
my video have a look at this it looks so
so so expensive even though it isn't
it's like very chic
very pretty I'm so excited to use this
but there's only some bit I don't know
if other pre-much stores sell more than
my store did the my store only had the
contour kit the lips and I think it had
like a metallic eyeshadow which is
pretty cool I'm pretty sure that was it
for the new collection so we're going to
start off with foundation and for
foundation I'm going to be using the my
perfect color moisturizing foundation
stick which I'm very excited about
because this is the only I think it's
the only foundation I haven't tried from
prymaat before and I've actually had
really good experiences with that other
foundation so I'm very excited to try
this one I have no idea this is going to
be my color though just because my
Primark was so manic I just chose this
one at random I just basically I was
hoping for the best
so hopefully it looks hot Eason
obviously grove judges on the color I'm
literally just gonna be judging this on
that the foundation alone because it was
really
really hard to try and find from a color
so I've kind of just like touch my hair
behind my ear so I won't get into my
face just cuz that I already want to put
my hair up I know a lot of people will
be like suffering put your hair up but I
don't think my hat will get my face like
this if it does then I'll put my hair up
so oh that's actually quite a good Colin
that's just a little bit darker than my
skin but I quite like it so I'm just
like dabbing this around my face making
sure I get a lot of coverage because
they love a lot of coverage I am gonna
be using my Beauty Blender for this just
because well I did actually get some GWA
brushes from Primark but I couldn't
actually find any brushes that goes with
this collection and I tried them in like
previous videos before so if you want to
see those I will leave it down below but
just basically just to see how good the
actual foundation is I'm gonna be using
my Beauty Blender and because this is
how I probably makeup every civil day so
let's give it a go so now I'm just gonna
blend it's actually going on really
nicely but that has actually blended
really really really well it's creamy
and you know what it feels really really
light on my skin as well it doesn't feel
like I've got any makeup on which is
good the only thing I would say is it's
not too full coverage which is nice but
I do love a full coverage foundation so
I don't know though well I probably want
maybe I'll go with a second layer after
just because you can still kind of wait
to see my spots and my pimples and so
I'm gonna blend it all in and then do a
second layer
foundation is applied and you know what
I actually really liked it so I acted um
what I say today is I just basically
applied a little bit more to where my
spots where my pimples and you know what
it's actually covered up really really
really nicely and it still feels so
light on my skin I don't mind she's like
really excited right now because this is
what's oh wow I genuinely think this is
kind of nicer than the foundation that I
use every single day I might have to
start using this as my everyday makeup
routine like it's so good so we have
concealer and it's anywhere near is give
this foundation I am one happy girl okay
this is the concealer so oh it's my
perfect color again and the disc just
says it's a liquid concealer so
hopefully it's good I love a liquid
concealer like I like stick white I like
some sick foundations I feel like they
could be a really hit or a miss but they
could be either really good or they can
really suck this one was really good and
it was to pump 50 like what the heck I
need to stop spending the amount of
money I do on my foundation because this
is so good now I don't know how good it
is for my skin and so I'll obviously
leave it on and on my second channel
I'll let you guys know my thoughts and
if it's maybe break out or what it's
made my skin like so I hope you have to
go and look out on that channel but
let's give it a go with the concealer so
I'm just gonna put this everywhere that
I usually put my concealer so this might
be quite a lot for you guys as I said I
like more of the full coverage look and
if I can see if it's really great for
brightening your skin now I know I have
got a contour kit but I feel like this
is it really accentuates you know so oh
this is such a really good color too I
was expecting this to be actually too
pale but it isn't like I actually think
this is a really really really nice
color I'm right surprised though because
this is the lightest shade that they do
and it's not actually that light now I
know it is on my skin but
like I don't know an affair but I'm not
like really really really fair so I'm
quite surprised but it looks quite nice
you don't win too classy of me as well
is if they're creamy but still blendable
still like a little bit foot work kind
of like more fuller coverage and
honestly so far this is ticking every
box however I don't know how it blends
yet so I'm gonna like apply everywhere I
normally do and then we'll see how well
it blends oh my goodness this actually
blends so well and you know what it's
actually a really good Jeep for the NARS
concealer that I use I was like 17
pounds I can remember is that actually
no this was 90 P I remember because like
I got to the counter and I was actually
like showing nothing from ITP
it was 90 P I was like oh my god this is
amazing like seriously if this hands
like the Naz packaging on it or a matte
packaging I would still say it's amazing
I was so shocked I generally think this
looks better than my everyday makeup
it's like full coverage its creamy it
blends well how to the yes
I am loving it I just hope it like stays
on my face cuz that's what I really like
about the products that I'm using
currently even though they're a bit more
expensive and they're quite pricy they
last all day so hopefully if these do do
the same thing genuinely I'm gonna stop
buying my NARS concealer and I'm gonna
get the 90 p1 and save myself 16 pounds
Tempe every single time that I buy
concealer
okay heretic exciting part hello we are
going in with the nude collection so now
foundation and concealer is done we are
going to be using the highlight and
contour kit and I don't know if you guys
have seen Kim Kardashian's Wes
collection but it looks so similar to
this and it's all a lot more expensive
as so I mean I haven't each fight it out
so I can't actually compare which is
kind of annoying but I can tell you how
good this is well at least my opinion on
it is so give it a go my little cousins
are watching me right now and they think
this looks really good so hopefully it's
done a comment quickly say hi yeah okay
come and say hi to the camera
okay there you go you made it so let's
get this a go
okay so inside the contour and highlight
kit you have a cream contour to it this
is like a brush which again is pretty
similar to a brush the Kim actually has
herself it's kind of weird I don't
actually know I don't know it kind of
acts like a little mini Beauty Blender
it's like a sponge of that but I mean
get like a little brush at the top and
then you also get a brow highlighter
which sounds and pretty cool and then
finally you get a cream highlighter duo
so obviously I'm going to start with the
quantity low as it's time to contour and
I will be using I don't actually
I'm going to get this rush of going so
there's two different contour sticks
which is actually pretty cool they're
like different shades but like hardly I
don't know then don't worry I don't know
if they are different shades yeah I
think this sounds like a little bit
darker this is a little bit lighter I
think I'm gonna use the lighter shade
just as my skin is
quite fair I don't wanna like roll it up
too high because I feel like it could
snap so it all might happen so I'm gonna
just apply I'm just gonna apply a little
bit on my cheekbone just under my
cheekbone and then I always put contour
on my forehead both sides and just
because it's like meant to make you know
forehead look smaller so who would want
that I think that's kind of evens you
know what this actually looks really
good it looks like it's gonna blend
really well so fingers crossed guys I am
gonna use the brush side because I don't
really know how the sponge side is gonna
work we're doing this if you guys have
any tips or if you really know how to
use I don't know I've never I've never
used I don't think a beauty blender for
Connor actually have once is a lie how
you use a beauty blender once when doing
contour but this one's a little bit
harder so I don't know how well it would
work I'm gonna kind of like buff it out
because I don't know other way I can
blend this I mean is blended okay
I kind of like that it's not like the
best contour I've ever tried but I think
I think the kid was eight pounds you see
like you can't expect much it's not
really making that much of a difference
but I think it's because maybe I used
the lighter shade maybe if I use the
darker one the dark shade isn't too much
darker though so and today it looks
quite natural though which is not as do
you think it's blended but hair isn't
getting in the way guys I promise
I don't know how I feel about this I
really don't know it doesn't be the
lover of condom what it lives my bronzer
I think we applied a little bit more
this side so maybe that's why it's
looking better but again I'm just kind
of buffing it in because with this brush
it's so like flat and thick I think it
will work better in like circular
movements I'm pretty sure it's all
blended I don't know how I feel it's not
like although it's just not the best
thing I've ever used and unlike it feels
more like a bronzer than it does a
contour and just because it hasn't
really liked to find my face and I know
I didn't really apply that much Lincoln
is that he like spent ages doing it but
with my contour stick that I normally
use pretty much every single day I feel
like it does a little bit more than this
but again it's a lot more expensive so
for the money I would still say this is
worth buying brush not a massive fan on
the brush I don't know the other side
might be better I just don't know what I
would use the side for because I feel
like it's not spongy enough and I don't
know it's already spongy enough to do
foundation with I kind of imagine like
when you damp this it's gonna be like a
Beauty Blender and it's going to expand
and you know just make your makeup apply
better because I don't know it just
feels too hard but I'll explore with
this I'll let you guys know but honestly
I'm not really rating the brush that
much is it awful like it's good that it
comes with the kit but I would
personally use my own brushes that I
have because I feel like I could have
done a better job so I'm going to use
the cream highlighter duo which again
looks so pretty and it's double sided oh
okay so this side is like a whitish
highlighter and then although K this
sides actually very different so this is
more like a gold highlight which is
really pretty and obvious because I have
Ferriss skin I'm gonna use the morphe
white-ish highlight because the gold
when I don't think I don't because it's
quite gold and I don't think it would
suit my skin very well so I'm going to
use the why
to side the only thing is I must say
every time I've used that cream
highlighter I've never ever ever found
myself reaching for it again because I
don't know for me personally every time
I've applied a cream product over a
cream product it's kind of lifted my
makeup underneath I don't know maybe
it's just support us up I've tried I
don't know maybe let me know if you guys
have ever had the same experience I
don't know it might just be me but I've
just I've never liked it I'm more like a
powder girl like I love a good powder
highlight boom or even like a liquid
have you tried the liquid drops oh my
goodness are amazing but creams never
work for me however this might just
change my mind so I don't know how to do
this I guess I'm just gonna stroke on
and I blend it in my Beauty Blender it's
snapped it's seriously snapped
okay that's great it snapped and to be
honest it hasn't exactly showed up in my
skin but I'm gonna put some on the end
of my nose the bridge Ramona this showed
up a little bit more but I feel like
it's still not like wow for me a
highlight like finishes a look highlight
is everything to me like I need that wow
I need that glow or you guys might think
it's too much is not enough for me when
it comes to highlight so for me I'm not
totally in love with this I feel like
that brow highlight might be pretty
similar you know what I'm actually gonna
try this I mean you can kind of see that
right when it comes down to eyeshadow I
got three different things they do so
this nude matte eyeshadow palette which
is so so so pretty but I did actually
try it and you know why it's so so so
good there's like no fallback the colors
are really nice now when it comes to
eyeshadow I don't really do much for my
everyday makeup routine I prefer more
that like blond sealer and I kind of
just put bronzer on my eyes if I'm being
completely honest so I've got to just
try these two colors out and they worked
really really really well then I blend
it really and I see this formula was so
nice and as I said no fall back even
with this like everyone here I don't
make in my crease and it was so nice so
I was gonna try this out
I've watched some of these videos and
I've seen so many people try this
palette out so I'm taking different try
out their nudes metallic buy cream
because I've never seen anybody try this
out and I feel like if you enjoy
watching videos like this you probably
some people try the eyeshadow palette
before so let's give this a go okay I'm
up close so this could be really boring
and if it is then I will use eyeshadow
but I just like to be really really
really fun to try out because the thing
is with cream eyeshadows is that they
are so quick and easy obviously you get
no full bath and anyone can do it like
no matter how good or not so good you
are at makeup even though they're kind
of I kind of believe that is no good or
not so good at makeup like you know
everyone's as good as so I'm gonna put
this on a flat brush and when it comes
to cream eyeshadow you can either apply
it with a flat brush or you can use your
finger but the thing is I've got a
really super long nails and this is
quite deep so I'm gonna be using a flat
brush which probably means I get more
pigment anyway so let's give this a go
it looks so pretty though so I'm just
gonna place this on my lid I mean it is
really pretty I'm gonna get a little bit
more because I don't feel like it's that
pigmented it's pretty but it's not it's
not as wow as I wanted it to be but if
you guys want a natural look this is
like this is so so so nice cuz kind of
why I want to do is put it all on my lid
and then just I blend it out a little
bit
the thing is you can see like how
pigmented it is on the brush but it's
just quite it's not really dark and so
it doesn't show up as much as I would
like it to let's just say this is not
the natural look I'm kind of thinking
maybe I should have used the eyeshadow
but I don't know if I can actually
really got over the top of this I will
though do an eye makeup look on my
Instagram or my vlogging channel so much
you guys are following both I'm sorry if
you came here for a dramatic eye look
but I thought it was different to try
out that metallic eye shadow because
nobody has the fun you know what it is
pretty I mean somebody probably has but
I haven't seen them from what I've seen
everyone has tried this out and everyone
knows it's really good
so I would recommend this because I've
used and it's really good but also this
is actually pretty nice if you go for
Saints at all and your strong point is
an eye shadow and this takes about two
seconds then I did try the mascara and
it was rubbish absolutely rubbish and
Primark is one of my favorite stores I
do not want to put it down or now I even
have to my own collection in Primark but
this was rubbish I really do not like
this and I would never use this mascara
and honestly I did think you'd go that
wrong and mascara but look at my gosh I
haven't seen them what I'm gonna do is
I've got a big drawer full of G every
way which are lashes of that Primark do
sell there everywhere in the store so
you go to Primark you will see G job
where lashes and let me tell you now
they are flipping amazing so I'm gonna
put these on I don't know which ones I'm
going to go for though because I thought
I have loads of options also just to
show how much I love Primark but
tweezers are also from Primark
what a difference that makes blood sit
on the others number two there we go
hello things were actually going on to
our last and final touch and this is
also prop the new action now I got two
different lip glosses kits or lip kits
I got a metallic one and then I also got
this nude one which is so pretty I think
what I'm gonna do because I've just
looked at the metallic and it's quite
light no no because see that so I think
I'm gonna put the new John I'm not gonna
bother doing right now because it looks
like quite a dark I don't like any liner
its lip gloss and normally I only apply
liner from doing a matte lipstick and so
because it's close I'm gonna put this I
may put some of my taking them at all
this is so nice
very subtle I really like this color
rather than like a pinky nude it's mica
bronty nude it's very pretty
it kind of feels like it doesn't feel as
glossy as I was expecting it to so I
don't know if there's metallics gonna
look nice in the middle but oh what the
hell's happened there can you see that
oh no what's happened is it's exploded
you know that like white lid it's not I
kind of think there's no life in little
plastic silver thing at the top of the
glass so that you didn't get a tiny bit
out well hello it is so thick how about
how am I going to apply this where I put
the brush in and take it out it's like
that this is disgusting I don't know how
I'm gonna do this well this still looks
alright I just have to like wipe it all
off and now it's just like all over here
which is kind of race I wanted to do
really like those when they're together
though and if you have applied it very
well because it's super thick and creamy
alright now but it feels nice hi
everyone today is the end of this video
I really hope you guys did enjoy it
hopefully it made your mind up it made a
decision if you wanted to try primal
makeup or not if you're thinking about
it actually overall I would recommend
going and get it because
I actually think it's really good
especially for the money but honestly
some of the things like the foundation
of the seal out I was blown away like it
is so good and really about the waters
as well but obviously we had that little
issue
thanks I might do a test in makeup video
that is we guys gonna see more off I
promised I would do more of an
extravagant look and I really hope you
