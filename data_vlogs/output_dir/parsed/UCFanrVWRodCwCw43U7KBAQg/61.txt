hello everybody and welcome back to my
channel I have missed you guys so so
much I know I didn't upload last Sunday
which i think is probably the second
time I've ever not uploaded it like the
whole job I've ever done YouTube I do
apologize oh I feel so bad that's why
I'm uploading today to hopefully make up
for it and there will be a video at
Sunday as usual so obviously makes you
guys are some of my channel I'm looking
out the spring is in the air it is not
really spring weather outside but I have
just got back from LA if you follow my
vlogs and you would have seen that I was
out there with Nickelodeon and it was so
cool without the Kids Choice Awards and
basically that's why I was so busy I
could not load a video and I felt so bad
we set it up trip for a couple of days
so I dedicated one day to shopping I
kind of wish had a little bit more but
it's probably good that I did it
anyways I really hope you guys do enjoy
obviously you go and check out my la
vlogs if you guys haven't already and
also make sure following the ground
because I've been uploading a little
pics while some out there so go check
those out too but yeah I really hope you
guys enjoy and let's get into the video
so obviously you can't go to LA and do
not forget something with LA on it so i
bought this hoodie and i loved it so
much i call this when i was actually
walking across Santa Monica Pier and it
was freezing that's partly why I got it
but I also got it because I do love it a
lot
laughing really nice color I love the
color so so much and it was $30 which
should be fair if I like is quite a lot
flat these little stores if I saw the
same shop I probably would have bought
it anyways
I have lived and died in this Champa
because it was so cold out there it
wasn't so cold but I wore denim shorts
and crop tops and it definitely was not
that whether this is mony OD so
practically you have to dyed it
I went to Victoria's Secret I know you
can get the s in the UK you can actually
get it in Brighton now but I figured
that suffering there is actually so much
better first of all being in this bag
which is so cute so i bought this sounds
like a beach bag and i love this chain
across here it was on sale for $20 I
thought what a bargain they've done like
a black that was also really nice this
is my favorite however I feel like it's
a little bit risky because I'm like the
messiest person so hopefully I can keep
it clean anyways this is like the best
thing I've ever bought because when we
went to the airport or cases were a
little bit overworked she quite a bit
over so me mom was getting charged $100
each for our suitcases being over well
beside we don't want to pay $200 so
that's absolutely ridiculous
so we remembered we have this bag and
just filled loads of stuff up in this
bag and this bag saved me $200 very glad
that I bought it these I think you're
either gonna love or hate I love these
so much now Victoria Secrets do the best
leggings in the entire world but these
are amazing for the gym like
high-waisted they're really super
flattering and they just feel so so good
so I just love these in general but I
just love the pattern it's kind of like
a modern II camo print I would say it's
kind of Camry yeah sucker modern II am
ogyny version I just thought these are
really cute I really like the colors
they were different
these are $69 I pay 69 pounds for these
in the UK so they they work out a little
bit cheaper
and when I got them in America I know
they are still super expensive but I
know I'm gonna wear them a lot when we
were shopping I knew that I wanted to
find a makeup bag I did not get mom from
Victoria Secrets cuz they do the best I
in love this so so so much I think
because I'm just in love with like a
rainbow at the moment
anything's like rainbow colors I just
think it's super pretty and I love that
so I fell in love this makeup bag it's
like perfect size for me because I
pretty much take like a load of my
makeup out and I just keep in there
every single day just looks it's so much
easier than having to get it out my
drawers and put it back in I take a lot
of makeup when I go places this at the
site was my favorite part of it and I
didn't realize well you don't you have
to pay for this separately because it
has a separate tab so this would
normally cost $10 but they don't charge
me for it and then open the makeup bag
and I found I had a little one inside as
well I haven't actually even take it out
yet but this is also so cute and I
didn't even realize when I bought this
makeup bag that you had this inside but
actually it's really really really sweet
and I might use this for my brushes for
something else yeah just checking that
one another one inside this one this was
$38 for this makeup well for both of the
makeup bags which I know obviously isn't
really that cheap but I just really
liked it and I knew that I was gonna use
it everyday three nice material and I
think it's a little bit nicer than I
could get from elsewhere forever 21 I
bought quite a bit right
this here is my favorite thing of the
entire haul and it is a vest top if
there's a rainbow vest top though and
honestly I just thought this was so nice
the mom and I basically lost each other
in forever 21 because it was so big and
I was like oh my goodness I need to pick
that up and show Mom and anyways who
bumped into each other and she was like
it's in that vest top I was like yes
it's so nice ever you followed me for a
long time you're gonna know I have this
thing about like thick vest tops like I
love the fact that it has thick straps I
think it makes it so much nicer also I'm
going to Coachella soon and I think I
might actually wear this there I love it
it was $15 I then have bought this
measure which I thought was gonna be
really cool on the model it was like I'm
done and I thought it looked super cool
this was 2012 19.95 a sickness
this is what it looks like again like I
think this would look super cool with
like denim sure so maybe just like a
vest up underneath there in fact this
will probably actually look really cool
I'm Denise yeah I really like it I love
mesh a lot I love like baseball style
cloves yeah I'm sure that I'll wear this
a lot especially during the summer then
I picked up some shorts because you
seriously cannot have enough shorts
these are so cute these are elasticated
so I thought it was gonna be really
comfy for like traveling they wanted to
expense if they were $12 90 to 420 mum
got a pair as well there isn't really
much to say about them apart from I
probably wear them quite a lot they're
really really really comfy and they
actually look quite good on as well so
happy with this purchase I have this
thing with the forever 21 trainer socks
I love them if I'm ever wearing socks
I'm always wearing like these trainer
socks they have so many different styles
so I put a little palm tree ones then it
was a put ones of rainbows on it which i
think is so cute and people right now
are probably gonna be like why are you
obsessive socks but I think these are so
cute and it's so good as well because
normally what my mum does like the sock
washing she gets all my socks mixed up
so like Jeff will get a parent buy socks
it's so annoying
however Jed never ends up with these in
his drawer I wonder why so I normally
always get these socks back and they're
pretty much all that's ever in my drawer
so they're great really they are how
much are they but okay no just Oh $1 90
the best one dollar 90 I've ever spent
then hope was some really pretty bras
I've got a nude one and I also got a
black one now I haven't needed strapless
bras for the longest time because I'm
always like taking I was just buying
normal bras then you know just take the
straps off and put them back on but it's
so annoying so I figured to get
strapless ones who have been much better
these were $12 90 which I don't think is
that pricey because if you went to
summer like I don't know Victoria's
Secrets
you're probably paying like 50 pounds
for a bra however if you went to Primark
you're probably paying about five pounds
and I love them all so I guess it's kind
of in the middle but I just thought
these were super pretty and it's really
nice as well because it doesn't have any
padding inside however it does have like
a lining so this should stay up really
well and hopefully should be wreath
patterning and they're just so pretty
so yeah and
these Fras and then the final thing that
I thought is this little best hop just
cuz it was so cute I love the froze
again there's nothing really to say
about it I just thought it's really
pretty it wasn't too expensive it was
five dollars I went to Fairfax and
Melrose which I don't know if you guys
know but basically on Fairfax has loads
of like hype these stores so basically
are one of those stores to actually look
for my brother jokes is really like into
that because I definitely wouldn't
consider myself like a hypebeast
so I went in there to like look for him
for like clothes and something I do
think it's really cool anyways we did
get some bits for Jed but I also did get
some bits for myself as well so I had a
little bit of a splurge but I figured
you can't get it here at home so I just
I just lived the moment and really
really really enjoyed there forget so
this is from 8 by bathing 8
so it's this jacket and all my goodness
I love it so much it's like it's a dark
khaki green it kind of looks like a ring
map but it's quite a thin material and
it has that camo inside which oh no it's
just the hood oh and it has only arms as
well like on the inner side which i
think is so cool you guys know that I
love camo I just thought it was really
nice and I love this on the arm so much
this is the back of the jacket and then
it's really cool as well because you can
actually take the hood off as well which
I probably will do no all the time but
sometimes I probably take that off and
yeah it just has like little pictures
I'm like a bit more detailing the other
side too which is cool this was a
hundred and eighty dollars so now isn't
it we're pricey but as I said I'll wear
it a lot so so so nice and it's not
something that I can get at home so
that's why I splurged and I did have to
get one thing well one other thing that
was from eight which is made by bathing
aids but that I actually bought
something from bathing any in the stores
they sell off the product serve like
sold out they like resell them and so if
they have the size it's like kind of
luck so you might really like something
can they only have that one size of a
that's like out so that's why I got this
cuz I love this so much smells like well
they have my well I didn't actually get
it oversized so I could got a large but
I thought it was gonna be really cause a
dress so I've got this baseball jersey
they've also had it in blue and red as
well which was also really cool but I've
never really seen a baseball jersey in
these colors before and I'm telling you
now like I love these so much I used to
have a top like this and I lived and
died in it and I'm sure I probably do
the same with this then it says a
bathing ape on the back and it's really
cool as well because it has a picture of
the apes on the sleeves
both sides which I really like and I
also really like this bit across here as
well like its collar I thought it was
really really really nice um so overall
I love this and it's definitely my
favorite thing that I bought and
probably the last thing that I buy for a
long time this was a hundred and ten
dollars but I love it ok moving on to a
little bit more affordable so I went to
find the body wax which is one of my
favorite shops in the entire world
ah I was so excited when I saw it
because I didn't realize the mall
actually had Bath and Body Works and
it's I was like freaking out anyways I
got some candy yes
home sweet home I have missed you oh
this is so cute I need to get some
candles because I love them so much I
shop down zombie in this wiki Tiki Beach
coconut scent oh my goodness it's
amazing it literally I don't know how to
explain it to you apart from yourself at
coconut like a sweeter version but it's
so nice it also it just looked so pretty
like the feel like it goes really nicely
with my bedroom so I cannot wait to put
this on the side as soon as I'm done
filming this video I'm lighting my
candles ears were actually on sale for
$12 90
normally the free with candles from Bath
and Body Works are $25 so I was very
happy about this so basically got them
half price I wish I could have got more
but I wouldn't been able to fit them in
my suitcase and this is what made us go
over quite a loss the next one I got is
vanilla and patchouli
she's also such a lovely scent I
actually just love vanilla scent I think
they're so pretty
because they're quite subtle but still
you can actually slice smell it and I
think once this one's lit it's gonna
smell absolutely amazing now I'm like I
love like sweeter scents and my mum
likes more like spory sense this one's
kind of in the middle so I think it's
really nice to just kind of put in the
hallway and because we're both gonna
love it
um I guess it is so nice like it is so
nice it smells like perfume rather than
a like a candle and they're gonna be a
very last candle that I got this is
actually I know I've always raved about
pumpkin pecan waffles but this is up
there of my favorite like it is
unbelievable this is frosted cupcake my
mom hates cents like this but I love it
honestly it's genuinely just smells like
a frosted cupcake like it makes me
hungry smelling it and it just makes me
crave so much sugar but it is the best
thing ever so I'm super happy with my
candy purchases and then some last obits
I got from Robin body works now if you
guys follow my blogs you will know that
I recently passed my driving test first
time first time so I bought a car a car
freshener I've got this one here that's
so cute reminded me a little bit of
Starbucks there was like loads of little
ones to choose from and then basically
you can buy loads of scents and you just
like slot it inside so I bought two
different scents I bought vanilla bean
because as I said I love the smell of
vanilla and then I also got bourbon
which is also such a great smell so my
car is gonna be smelling fresh and
looking cute oh and I did actually get a
face mask I've opened so many face masks
but I've never owned one from other Body
Works and I figured as I love everything
else why not try their face mask that's
the not least of course I got a Sephora
bag this is the shop I like what like
needed to go to more than any shop
because there was like too
I wanted to get so badly and they had
sold out it was so sad it was like quite
a small Sephora we went to and what's it
called Beverly Center is the shopping
mall that we went to it's really good
but the Sephora is like really small so
I wanted to get some Anasazi lip glosses
they didn't have them in stock so I
ended up getting this one by tarped it's
a gloss and it's called hella and it's
like going back to I've got it on right
now it's like a light pinkish nudie
color but the gloss is quite thick and
that's what I really love about the
Anastasio glosses so pretty much that's
why I got this one because it was the
closest one to it and a bloomin loved
heart and then I also did pick up some
bits from well in Sephora from NARS so I
use this pretty much every single day
and it's matte well I had like run out
of it anyways I'd like hit pan
completely and it was like there was
just like tiny little bits because I do
so much of it so it was it basically
looked broken and it was it was coming
to an end so I bought this bronzer again
and this is a Laguna is the start of a
bronzer like honestly it's amazing to
contour with so I bought this and then
also I did to rebuy my foundation I'm
currently using which is the shade glow
and this is in the shade medium one
Punjab and this is such a good
foundation I love it so much I should
have really bought a pump I just kind of
forgot but yeah the reason I got NARS
from Sephora is because there isn't
actually an oz near me so if I went into
town I couldn't go and get in ours and
I'd have to buy it online anyway and I
figured as I was in there I might as
well just get it oh my god Beauty
Blender I've got a black one just
because I think it's the only color I
haven't owned or Pepita ah there's
probably a couple more but I haven't
owned a black bee - Brenda so I thought
give it a go oh hang on there's two more
things for Naz again though this I
actually wanted since yen I which i
think is four years ago which is
actually kind of crazy and it's this Naz
kabuki brush
and I did buy it is really pricey but I
love everything out our sonars I wanted
it for so long so I actually went and
bought it after about maybe three four
years so I bought this brush and I'm
honestly I'm so excited about it
everyone that hasn't so look like your
contour like this will change your life
that really comes to contour so I will
let you guys know how I feel about it
and let you know is it really worth
money and then it very finally probably
gonna end up quite boring no I've got a
nice concealer because I love their
concealers and this is in the shade like
two vanilla and it's really good it's
like super creamy it's not too full
coverage but it's like creamy and it's
it's really nice on my skin and it's
it's really nice on that foundation too
so it also fit to this up so everyone if
there is the end of my loss and please
whole I really hope you guys did enjoy
it I feel very lucky and I had a little
bit of the splurge and I'm just so
excited to put everything away and try
it right you have tried majority at home
but actually where some of the things
and try the makeup out so I can't weigh
