oh she's so sweet because to be fair
like you know the Reds one of my
favorite colors photoshooting read this
yeah exactly
right before I get us out I put two
jumpers in the basket then I really only
meant to get one okay let's get me two
outfits didn't you yeah and I don't get
one and then I took out no problem John
pop doesn't really go at all this is a
jump nice it's not actually really nice
but it reminds me of tennis in the face
yeah I go first no I really like this
Edward yes I think it's actually so
accused mr. ventriloquist yeah but my
rescue I reckon that God is a denim
shirt or something yeah but did it
orjust denim jeans yes anybody like
denim or like just even black jeans you
know be really nice I think it's got to
be really nice so you can put this
jumper these hills so far ok joke what
up next fact silicon pretty nation I've
got even more right why there's my red
trousers this is a risk judge than
someone they're gonna lay what a onesie
that your house is I've gone she's so
noise
the problem is they like different color
rates busy it's like a actually
intervention I'm sorry do it just like
you have anything individually these are
really nice do you think like honestly
look there are you so nice over a
hundred percent were these I just yeah
the red and the red together I wouldn't
wear them together I would wear them
separate like I'm whether to the black
chalk on your watch others I think it's
got more on Hispanic still more right
like a different shade of braids hold up
the ranks
did he get any red the church is
actually like nice though but it's just
the fact that you've got all right this
over some wardrobe browsers wait so what
did you do that you didn't get one out
of it so you've got this to go with the
other jumper that you've met together
been and we've got some I'll be honest
no you're not and it's a very silly goes
do everything by oh no oh no must have
been pin the back back to the dad you so
noise oh I see them they are there hoop
earrings but they have little hearts in
them I'm a ghost actually so Q I thought

I am moment you're naked in my one okay
that's actually so nice right so that's
gents complete outfit so Jade you want
to take that back I'm pretty excited to
try this on but can I just quickly say
before we meet when two cases out there
I do feel like Jeff was actually read
thoughtful here because like read is
actually like one of my favorite colors
I love it so much I was thinking maybe
subtle favorite colors see see I told
you so why do you like to be that's so
sweet but unfortunately he's just got
too much right
however I do actually like like all the
clothes so hopefully it doesn't look too
bad it's just the color coordination you
know okay right so let's move on to
cases outfit I feel like it's older it's
got more of an advantage
I feel like you know I am older yeah so
I feel like you've got more one
advantage because I've known me longer
you know I don't know if there anymore
so it's all true by it so I'm not gonna
lie I can't remember what well things
we've got it like a week ago I remember
it was it was sick okay so I was
thinking you best have not had help from
Nicole that's why my life ordered this I
actually showed you go after shoes I
that's a nice outfit
okay okay okay you're right that's gonna
go let's start with facing Oh somebody
right

to strength right little bits of rope
will they die they tie my tie at once
late I'm looking at the Mel not
understand short bigger look as cool as
they look for mine too yeah but then
they call them on what the models
hopefully yeah okay right there's a good
gonna answer them up put them over

double denim again you again what you
loved up with anybody no matter what
anybody says I love Jonathan and so much
it makes my heart very very very happy I
think it was like a low-cut top
oh it's a buddy so it's boy saying yeah
remember what you got anyway I to be
fair that's actually really not as nice
yeah like I love this yeah I know I
don't really know what else to say about
it it's quite that basic obvious basic
but it I think it would look pretty nice
yeah like the jeans it's quite a casual
outfit that we went for yeah is exactly
where I put the shoes I've just checked
are the exact same ones shoes yeah
there's like hundreds and hundred got
the exact same way oh did he come up
with my new bean or something and you

color and everything in your is no gonna
come out on the phone yeah so on yes
okay always a garden okay
good stand out or don't get signed up
the wrong reasons isn't the best reasons

the most up the note punch it wasn't you
actually it was really good stuff I
didn't know he didn't have a budget it's
a nice watch all right nice yeah it
looks expensive right I thought I
