hello you beautiful bunch of people
welcome back to my channel and now for
today's video I am so so so excited
because I went to my Nan's
earlier today and I picked up her makeup
bag today as you guys can see from the
title of this video I'm gonna be
applying a full face of my Nan's
makeup so this is mine and a makeup bag
you know if we're comparing it to my
makeup bag it's definitely a lot smaller
so this is like her everyday typical
makeup bag is so cute though I love it
so much it's so sparkly
very very very pink and when I'm around
there earlier today my nan said to me
that I'm gonna be very shocked so I've
decided not you to look inside the bag
yeah I have no idea what I'm gonna pull
out but she was like more than happy for
me to do this and honestly I think she
was like having a laugh and fit was
giving it to me so I'm kind of like a
little bit nervous I think mine was a
little bit nervous as well but overall I
feel like this is gonna be very
interesting
cybron hope you guys do enjoy the video
as much a big thumbs up if you guys do
and subscribe down below if you guys
have a little ready and without further
ado let's get into the video okay so
let's open the makeup bag and see what's
inside okay she's gone you know this is
quite jam-packed there's quite a bit in
there so we're gonna pull it all out
obviously we're gonna start with
foundation I don't think my nan uses
primer so we're going to go straight
with the foundation that is totally fine
okay so oh yes none okay
what is she thinking now I love a dark
foundation but this is extremely dark
obviously you guys can see like me
holding this up to my skin how much
darker it is but this actually is the
shade that I currently use so you can
see that it's a huge huge huge
difference and I still find this as kind
of like dark for my skin as well so
either I'm pretty nervous to use this
and this is probably one of the reasons
why she thought I'd be very shocked it's
weird though because like I never
actually seen my nan look this dog
before so I don't know how or when she's
used this obviously
this is the Maybelline New York dream
satin liquid foundation now I have uses
before it's such a good foundation
however not really in this color so I'm
gonna start off by applying it to my
hand I'm not gonna use her brushes
because she didn't have too many because
she uses a Beauty Blender and I just
kind of left that at my Nan's house so
we are gonna go in with the foundation
I'm gonna use one of my brushes I think
I'm just going to use like a stippling
brush just to blend it in so let's apply
it on the back of my hand oh my goodness
look at the color difference like just
even on my hand like that is literally
crazy okay right let's uh let's do it
okay by the way can I just point out my
hair looks so like gross right now I
just this is kind of what I woke up like
and didn't really want to do anything to
it today so we're just gonna have to
deal with this for now let's start let's
apply the OH
oh my goodness
I look uh turley crazy right now because
clearly this is about people with a lot
darker skin than myself um what what am
I not thinking I have absolutely no idea
what she was thinking I think in a
minute once I've applied this I'm gonna
face in my Nana and ask herself because
I need to understand how she makes us
walk or why she bought this like in the
first place because it's extremely dark
I feel like like the more I could try
and blend this in the worse it looks
honestly I just look so stupid like when
you compare my face to my neck right now
and I don't really know if it's cheating
if I apply like kind of I blend it down
my neck I feel like it kind of is so
maybe I will just do like just my face I
know I look worse but I feel like it's
cheating otherwise and so I'm just gonna
carry I'm kind of just like blending
this in but it's not really moving that
much it's weird because like I love this
foundation like I have used this so many
times like I actually have this
foundation in my drawer obviously not
this color but yeah maybe
why to much I'm not entirely sure it's
kind of hard to tell with this dark
shade because I feel like normally maybe
I would apply more but because it's so
dark I'm trying to apply less and just
blend it in like as much as I physically
can right sir I'm gonna call mine and
right now because I seriously need to
ask by Warren Earth was she thinking oh
okay right let's find mine anamarie
since love a girl FaceTime with my nan
okay oh when I look at it up guys's even
worse right I'm calling her right now
I'm filming my video why I'm using your
makeup that is the color wig you got
what was she thinking I'm not gonna go
with that I promise you I'm just I'm
just put it on the internet for like a
thousand people to see you know yes I
don't know how this is what I don't
understand how you use this I'm really
dying because I can't make this work
Johnny when you saw it on the Shelf you
must have thought like that's that's too
dark look at the color okay it's okay
don't worry it must rock it because I've
never noticed before make sure you say
hi to the video as well that's so funny
so uniquely did just pick the first one
up off the shelf I don't know maybe like
somebody recommended it to her so she
just thought they were all the same and
suddenly it's gonna magically be her
shade obviously they have loads and tons
and tons of shades this definitely does
look more of mine and my
it's color so I'm gonna be applying this
just like everywhere that I'd normally
would apply my makeup I might actually
pry a little bit more than usual because
like this is so dark I'm gonna try and
make it look a little bit lighter if I
can so I usually apply it like straight
underneath my eyes like in triangle
shapes oh this is actually really good
oh wow this is like super creamy and
this is light so hopefully you know in
my um you might make the foundation look
a little bit better once I blended it in
you know I'd actually really like this
concealer I genuinely would use this
myself like honestly like totally would
uses myself and then I apply a little
bit my chin well I say a little bit
there's quite a lot there but you know
we're having we're having to use a
little bit more product than usual today
and then it appear on my forehead as
well so this is like this is what I
would normally do one use concealer and
then to blend it in I'm gonna use like a
little powder brush just to kind of like
buff it out I think this is maybe like
more of the color that my Nana had for
the foundation because if my face was
like all this color but go would
actually look like
alright so the concealer is definitely
making it look a lot better so I'm just
gonna carry on blending this in right so
concealer is officially as blended as I
could possibly make it blend into my
face you know what this actually like
that is a very good concealer I would
honestly use it like I actually really
really really rate this good on you nan
um so we're now going to go in with
bronzer if she has ones that this
bronzer I think so I don't know how you
plant this so this is by a San Tropez I
think I say pronounce it and wow this is
this is very dark as well Weaver we
managed to get something even darker
than the foundation ladies and gentlemen
is the bronzer Wow none you do wanna
look tanned
she clearly gets it from me so how'd you
guys can see this is very dog this is
one of the many reasons why I love mine
and because only she with a very fair
skin we're going to a shop and buy this
bronzer and after she's got the
foundation I think this would be alright
if she had a light foundation because
like obviously you could just like blend
it out but it's because the foundations
so dark that you you just don't want to
go any darker and I wasn't expecting to
be pulling this out of the bag
and the thing is like it looks like a
really good bronzer as well obviously
it's just the shades again so I can't
really rate the bronzer too much cuz
it's really hard because this is gonna
be too dark for me but I'll try and give
it a go so again I'm just gonna apply
this right normally would starting with
the side of my cheek bone I'm actually
really surprised because this doesn't
actually show up that dark considering I
don't know maybe it's because the
foundations really dark so it's not as
noticeable and actually I do actually
really like this bronzer because it
isn't like so in your face like it's
actually quite subtle which is really
hard to believe but it honestly actually
is and then I'm just gonna apply a
little bit on my jaw line to try and get
rid of those double chins and I did say
try for a reason there okay right there
we go actually now I do look I do look
very bronzed but you know what we're
just living life to the fullest right
now we're gonna move on we are going to
go with a lovely abhilasha now why don't
you got mine on this blush I do love
this blush it's very out there very
bright pink so I don't want to apply too
much but it's so pretty it's by unique
and it's yes it's pretty so bright so
let's get a little bit of the blusher on
the brush and let's apply this to my
cheekbones
I feel like blush is great because it
makes people like aged left and then it
does not have highlight because this is
the big question this is my favorite
product
I'm not sure I'll wait this might be
actually is it this is it yes nan legend
okay
so she's got this like highlight here
I'm actually entirely sure what the
brand is because it doesn't say oh my
goodness it's really pretty though look
at that
there's like such a nice subtle
highlight I love it but I don't I just
can actually tell you what it is because
it doesn't actually say so I'm gonna
apply this on my nose and kind of like
on the bridge of my nose I see that that
actually looks so pretty I genuinely
love that so much that is so lovely and
then I do like kind of like the top of
my lip and then I just do my cheekbones
called the top of my cheekbones top my
cheeks okay we're gonna move on so she
doesn't actually do eyeshadow because
she just beautiful without it so we're
gonna go in she does use eyeliner
we've got eyeliner but three different
options of eyeliner we have this eye
Oh way that is so cool
hang on so I thought this was a lid I
think this is like a crayon eyeliner
like seriously like I'm so sorry I
promise you I'm going straight to the
shops after this and I'm by a mind not a
new eyeliner do use that same one I'm so
sorry
won't even care that I broken it but I'm
obviously gonna go straight out after
this video and buy her a brand-new one
because I'm clearly just broken it I was
a slightly nervous to use this anyway so
we're just gonna put this to the side
even gonna be really careful but I'm
asked to find out what brand that is so
I can get only one we've got two other
eyeliners and luckily in her bag so we
have this one here which is like a
twisty kind of like pencil and then we
have another pencil eyeliner and again
just another twisty pencil eyeliner no I
don't use own pencil eyeliners I only
use liquid
and I can just about do it oh I feel
like this is gonna be really really
really hard it's kind of like vice versa
like if you use a pencil eyeliner I'm
sure you'd kind of struggle use in
liquid liners it's just one of those
things you get really used to so I'm
pretty nervous I don't know how well I'm
gonna do on this so let's give it a go
I'm actually going to try and attempt a
wing as well but yeah okay alright let's
do it let's do it so I'm just kind of
like finishing the flick but I have not
really done a good job there guys this
is the result of the eyeliner
it definitely wasn't the eyeliners for
it was definitely mine I'm just not
really used to using an eyeliner like I
mean a crayon eyeliner and many you see
use like a liquid liner so I actually
found this really really really
difficult I feel like I got an okay job
but they definitely don't match up and
jamuna's like this crayons actually
pretty good I'm not sure who the
companies buy again but it's actually a
pretty good crayon it's just I wasn't so
good at applying it so using this
mascara I feel like it's really really
really great for bottom lashes because
it's really good at like spreading all
my lashes out so I feel like this
mascara is actually pretty good again I
really actually do not know the brand
because it seriously like does not say
but it's eye on Clarence it's Clarence
that's what it is
such a really good mascara I actually
really liked it my nan doesn't have brow
products so we're gonna go with the very
final product to complete this look so
we've got two different lip gloss so we
have this one by a MAC Cosmetics it's
like a very hot pink so it's kind of
like in-your-face and then we also have
this gloves here by Sally Hansen which I
don't actually know this brand but I'm
gonna go with this one though because
personally I like it more and it's very
like wowza
and I would never wear a bright pink
like this personally so I'm gonna give
this a go and see what it looks like
this is actually so nice like honestly
it smells amazing
it doesn't look good on me but it smells
so good
wait hey guys I just realized when and
does have one more product so this is
the tarte skin mess i actually
recommended my nan to get this it's so
good so we're gonna kind of finish off
the look set it all into place by
spraying some of this on beautiful so
everyone here is the end of the video
and this is my end result for my makeup
using my Nan's makeup bag now i have
actually really honestly enjoyed like
experimenting with my Nan's makeup but
