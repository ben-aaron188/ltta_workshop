hi everyone welcome back to my channel
now for today's video I've got a very
special guest is Anastasia princess for
today's video we are doing the very
requested makeup bag swap I'm so excited
also kind of nervous as well though cuz
I feel like we have I don't know like we
do work different me at how many
positives because obviously you are a
lot darker than me yeah and I'm really
pale and you always have a tan
so obviously the completely different
shades of grey much everything in our
bags so to be honest this is probably
the lightest I've been like because
basically I get a lot of spray tans and
don't hate me for that because it could
be way worse it could be getting like
tanning beds and stuff that is that
really bad for your skin
this way it's not bad for my skin like
at all really like I mean it might pop
up my paws for whatever it's not like
action bath for me so I really enjoyed
just having spray tans I really liked
myself being tan so I'm kind of like I'm
a Payless right now but normally I am a
lot darker so I really hope you guys
enjoyed the very awaited and requested
video it's much a big thumbs up of you
guys did how many likes are we gonna go
for Anna 50,000 yeah
also we quickly film a video over on
Anastasia's channel lid we did a snog
marry avoid which includes a lot of
youtubers that you guys may know so go
check it out I'll link it down below oh
my god a decent cut of Australia that's
a cute idea or maybe not everyone
straining person's gonna be like how are
we yeah I don't really know what that
was anyways I hope you guys enjoy it and
let's get into the video one so here are
our makeup as this is what my makeup bag
looks like I actually cuz my makeup bag
is quite big I could fit my palates and
stuff inside the makeup I couldn't fit
my palette in this is where's got the
pie outside so we're now gonna swap them
over so here you go and by the way he
got its happy yeah he's quite happy as
really hope this is like I haven't
cleaned for makeup or anything
don't judge me he's revived because this
is the makeup I use like every day this
is the one that take somewhere so like
if I was saying Anastasia's house in
London
like I just this is already packed I'm
ready to go and if I'm saying yeah so
this is literally just my makeup I
fought with me because there are the
things that we like mainly love to use
on yeah this is my everyday since I'll
use everyday yeah okay right so okay
let's do it let's open it up I'm very
excited
loving the makeup bag and I'm loving you
oh my girl huh your money that's not
dirty oh it's a sort of palette yeah oh
that's like one of my favorite palettes
ever how nice so nice I know that I've
used it quite a lot though so any good
you use it everyday I'll use that I'm
using a primer that's what you said I'm
using green pointy green prize it's so
funny because obviously green hands
aren't the right but I don't like I'm
very loved you don't really happen
I don't yeah I don't really get right
that much redness so I feel really
grateful for that but now I'm using
green primer and I don't even get
readiness or really I mean will be a
little bit but like yeah yeah yeah oh I
put the norm yeah you've got the normal
okay I'm a normal energy love using the
hourglass primer but I've actually run
out of it so sorry you have to deal with
that moment so no I love it isn't very
much left the hourglass prime is so
expensive guys I can't afford it and
bankrupt oh yeah you cried you go on
about that one it's meant to be really
good yes so good I've got the green
concede on this is so weird
so my Robin listen everywhere something
you do I just make sure got my toe my
finger so this is the only thing I use
with my fingers or you suck a stippling
brush but you know I'll say this feels
really similar so like I need a lot more
this is so weird
Melissa I've used like green concealers
before you actually use as a primer I
thought for these are really weird
I love the green primer it's so good
alright next is foundation oh you need
to use a mirror like yeah there's a big
mirror in there okay right so Austin
Foundation Jordan first of all you've
got
I've got to yeah I've got the colleague
even better globe apparently Mac Studio
Fix fluid but this is what change this
NW 25 and is that a show to see snd to
look at the difference of that there
dance like this is like so yeah this is
L'Oreal Paris true match and I don't get
you to come as either
no but if so like I want that it's
literally the very like that's a very
large no no way because I normally my
sadness yeah but I'm really paying at
the moment so so I'm using this I mean
are watching your own Beauty benders all
right just because we felt like of this
a little bit cream
yes we're using each other's brushes but
we're gonna use our own Beauty blenders
and that's the only thing you haven't
yet okay right I'm gonna put it oh my
gosh what the hell Anna do you realize
how I this is I know it's so like a pain
oh my god I'm actually gonna look crazy
I'm gonna look so weird oh God oh okay
right let's go in look how dark this is
all like that is the thingy so I
actually think the like I think they
won't get away with I think that like I
think you'll get away with it we've got
bronzer and stuff but what the hell is
that
oh god oh that's really that is very
light yeah this is gonna be really dark
I just love having color this is really
orange for me
oh my few minutes no that's crazy I need
to get my hair on that that doesn't
really talk it's because I don't realize
how dark my foundation is and I'm sure
you don't even realize how light it is
thank goodness like these are a lot of
shades that's not like I hate makeup
companies that don't do a lot of shades
so unfair oh my goodness
it really is dog bite your neck yeah
that is really log but it makes me think
how do I get away with that cuz I'm not
that much darker lot on my hand look how
bad it is on my hand yeah that is no
Alyssa but in your face though yeah it
doesn't really bad
I think I'll get away but they watch if
I planted it down to the neck and sir
quickly changing subject whose watch the
greatest show man my favorite movie
we'll watch it together doing waiting in
it it's the best thing ever
Lucas here so good I would have play
that right now but it up my phone I love
it yeah my friends it's so good let's
put it on okay so I praise your my
makeup is that kind of blended now well
it's kind of like blending I just don't
feel really like pale or there's nothing
wrong with being pale but for me I'm
just not like I don't know just
personally don't like myself being
better cuz I know I don't
alright I'm gonna make concealer insane
heart-shaped hey that's my favorite
shade light/medium and I have got
collection at last imperfection and
which I also do a love this concealer
this is in the shade fair one so this is
the lightest but to be fair I did you
see use the shade but I would use it
over like a dog foundation so for me I
feel like this is gonna be the same
shade as the foundation so I don't
really know how this is gonna go yeah
but on the anointing with really fair
skin because normally I was to use
concealer to like brighten it a little
bit yeah a fair skin you can yeah I mean
actually is a little bit lighter look
it's kind of like that yeah it's a
little bit yours isn't actually going
that life is like today looks light will
meet when I wear that that I've honestly
that's so nice I do actually have a
lighter concealer than that to be fair
in the boxes alright another okay let's
see I know this because I have yeah and
yeah it isn't there somewhere
I should be I think it's because I'm
really pink toned and this is really
what I use yeah and I use like yellow
tie later tons on these so much I think
that's why it looks really weird color
on me yeah maybe so I'm gonna move on
now so Anna's got this Anastasio contour
kit this is the light to medium
contour care and let it has obviously
the paler colors and then also have some
darker colors so if you like you can
definitely like a bronze up my making yo
of it and I'm gonna use this like a
yellowy banana rachet to kind of like em
powder underneath my eyes and stuff so
I'm going in
yes I love that
Oh the odds one side yeah yeah okay
that's a Giga so I don't have a counter
in here and I've really all your skin so
oh my god yeah I forgot about salt on
your skin I used to use powder so much
but I'm going to use it so much anymore
like sometimes I do but it kind of
depends like I'm gonna have to skip the
situation I'm you have to go to story
and I also can I just have my I don't
know my brother yeah oh that's a package
at the door one sec I'm Grady orange if
you guys follow my vlog channel you know
that I dance a lot so many deities of
juicer eyes anyway so you can see that
on my vlog channel brightness it's carry
on and by the way yes have definitely
got pajama bottoms on so ok oh I'm gonna
just going with all that looks I mean I
say well this product what is contour
bronze or whatever it's called it's
really nice that's why there that is so
goodness and it is really good but the
thing is I've been only do two shades
I'm non sponsor which is really bad it
doesn't give a light to one because I
sometimes want it that's too dark for me
yeah I think we've one normal foundation
this time a bit too dark for me CSU
really matte now I'm on yeah you can
really like oh my goodness oh but I
don't like here oh no you don't mind can
never like me see because I have such
all any skin I have to mattify my makeup
down as I will literally look like yes I
just I just don't I don't really like
being really mad I just I don't know you
can highlight your chin stuff and you
yeah yeah okay oh my goodness it'll be
different
how do you do this cuz the progress that
you to shoes I just use this one
seeing that looks so much better on your
skin and just mind it does not look like
her or mine look so many dark side it
doesn't look good looks way too dark it
doesn't look like
skin you got that really straightener I
just like used to side out of the brush
I'm just kind of buffing I just thought
okay I just look so awful like I hate it
I don't even know how I'm gonna blend
this in lice I obviously just put too
much on my cheek when you drive into in
if you can see it I'm not white here I'm
medium here and dark it's funny cuz we
love all the products at each other uses
but we do know it is dirty shows right
so I have blended in my contour but I
definitely better now yeah you look I
feel like I do look more pale erm you
know actually looks pale you in real
life a lot more yeah I think so too
but anyway it's moving on so can I just
clarify I don't have a star I don't
really use brow products that much
because I did actually get my eyebrows
micro blade did last year so I just kind
of went for a grounders come be bothered
I thought what's the point like I have
the micro bated so when I don't wear
makeup eyebrows that kind of a they look
pretty dark and sup I mean they faded a
lot now so I need to get the micro pages
again so I probably should use brow
products now I just never bothered I
have a spoolie and stuff to brush them
in place cuz I could have them all wild
but ya know if I guys are going to look
off I thought this is gonna read me
rewrite my makeup apologize in advance
sorry I'm gonna talk over you then oh
you don't have a Russian brushed idea
can I use this I'll use that anyway I'll
just use the bow because they're really
similar shades that's a really nice
brushes are you told me today yeah so
nice it says desert rose yeah bye Matt
I'm gonna use the tightest Pro palette
from tarp
I feel so pain come on I've never been
this it's weird I've used up green
concealer and I feel more pink than I've
ever been in my life you know I mean
yeah no great leap I'm not suffering
partly yeah the blush is really nice oh
yeah I just like I just look red you do
mean I don't like this and AH I'll it
really just had a really pale I don't
yeah you do but you don't actually look
that bad I feel like I feel like I look
worse anyways right oh this is what we
do different as well every time we do
our makeup yeah I always do want my
shadow and eyes laughs let me jump in
the comments what you guys doing I'll do
my highlight last I leave highlight and
then but are then I do my eyelashes
before you you could you do my eyelashes
are always so because I feel like it
finishes that up like sometimes like
even do my lips and do my eyelashes I
think that's just color can't be
bothered to my lashes so that I just do
it laughs yeah I've gone through a very
light brown toned makeup look today I
don't really think you understand well
that's really pigmented this highlights
well nice it's really pretty isn't it
yeah I feel so lots of that highlight
but I thought it's really hard to do it
this brush because it's so tiny so like
how do you blend it in that my direction
is punched in the eye but you know I
mean yeah but it's just like I love that
fan brush I thought it was a body shot
one it was really good okay I'm kind of
not sure if I put too much highlight on
I feel like because I had that little
brush it's kind of a bit hard to blend
but it's okay it obviously wants for you
but I don't know I just find it harder
to use like a small garage I think it's
really good like on your nose and stuff
you know it's just hard across your
cheek so anyways let's move on so that
has got this South X of revolution
palette I do actually have this at home
and to be fair I haven't actually got
around to using it I think it's cuz I'm
just so stuck on what I love I just
don't really see the point but I've
heard that this is so pigmented and
honestly it looks amazing
so there's many more shades and normal
pallet wood yes so it's actually
interchange 24 24 shades that's good
that is so and you've got a lot of
shades as you don't know you couldn't
just create one color to look with it
you could create a price um yeah with
that there's a blue there's a green
there's a purple yeah if you've got
everything and it's a good mixture
between marks and shimmers I don't
really do much like come to a shadow
hard to roll on it with this so this is
gonna be an absolute flop right I'm
doing it with me maybe in a master
please please please precise and liquid
eyeliner I'm really nervous to use I
said I feel like it's gonna be a black
enough but let's give it a go we might
as Maybelline as well I'm warning in
definitely not like this ya see my eyes
I chipped out cuz why I love it right
that was really hard to film on camera I
feel like I feel like we tried really
hard though yep I got one that's kind of
okay and the other not so much I think
it's just really hard to just go over it
so many times so how do I come back I
love my everything no eyes get it though
honestly I do get it because I used to
be the same I could only use a pen
eyeliner I think just where it was in
like jet black and I've hated going over
again and again yeah so I just like
using that one now I think eyeline is
just one of those things you just get so
used to then whenever you can occur
every it down by I just love down that
israelian anyway so we are going to move
on I'm gonna go for SCARA I'm gonna go
in oh ho yeah I'm Scott right - oh no
yeah muscaria i super starring yes hi I
am using yang you go first I'm gonna go
with the Maybelline the falsies and push
a drama this is really good yes so good
and then I'm using the urban decay
troublemaker mascara that I do also have
and is so good so I'm pretty excited
look people say don't share mascaras but
we are doing anyways so here we go
the Tartus pro glow palette and this is
really really pretty oh okay that's so
good oh and everything got mixed up
shall we bow to the hoedown throwdown
guys like start Ryker if you're like
tidying up the house but it's a
one-on-one challenge that applies to
music all right I'm gonna go in the back
now so we've got the GTR I say I'm not
rude a mythical oh I use those two I'm
also using TWA this is in a makeup bag
and this is flaming girl yes love that
so me entities
I think is actually my favorite flaming
though or nothing and if you actually
have very mad yeah so now I love these
because these are so sick yeah wait you
do have twitter all right no shut up
seriously
what does that mean I can't use my
tweezer you have to know that a song
fair I know how did you wash it well I
won't use my pleases yeah usually while
you go so what are you doing you're at
home use my fingers i Kylie literally
can't because my nose so long I'm gonna
struggle I probably still use my fingers
to be fair like I'll use the tweezers a
bit this is gonna be really awful okay
here we go
I can't do that I want to really
struggle in this is so hard that was
better than I thought that was better
than I thought oh I so I actually got on
reasonably quick they look so nice on me
oh my god this was your breathing eyes
and they're quite big amazing busty Rafi
Rafi Rafi I've got like this act even
more bits that says yeah well originated
I think it's cause I quite points it up
and you put concealer in Scenario the
highlight this time oh yeah it's so nice
so I've got two different shades of
lipstick so I can choose i've got either
what's this it's like white bottom yeah
but I just
is it color pop though yeah it's gonna
pop so I'm in MIDI 6ko 2 or I've got
that dream matte
spice by Mac I think I'm gonna go for
the Mac Quon but the thing is I use
glosses that Anna uses and that I do
have maps in my bag as well but that I
put a gloss over the top so that's
another thing that we do do really
different yeah he's just sticking your
lashes well there's a red remember I'm
ready to reach out your confidence oh
you know red looks so awful on me like
Oh like I like Burgundy but pure red
something something I don't know I don't
know what I'm asking how are you feeling
without your browser so sad okay sorry I
don't know how I didn't use to fill them
in yeah it is crazy when you do stuffing
the minks they do you make such a
difference don't they yeah that gloss
actually looks so nice on you everyone
is so here are our finished looks you
look great yeah I feel like red you look
really different I can't lie do you
think of mine do you think I'm they're
very different eyeshadows wise no uh-huh
I think I only looks really similar to
what you yeah
you just a lot paler do I still have
really pale lipstick what's that the Mac
one yeah that was my I really like that
yeah but then I feel kind of lost about
my glass yeah I love my hair really nice
you know I mean so but I honestly if I
was like I don't know how to explain
this basically if I ever had the twins
have no makeup but Anastasia's makeup
bag I would use the makeup bag yeah I
mean ya know your eyeshadow looks so
nice like so nice I think you should
think my lashes that make it yeah that
actually is I think that's that hi
everything you get wrong I'm not saying
