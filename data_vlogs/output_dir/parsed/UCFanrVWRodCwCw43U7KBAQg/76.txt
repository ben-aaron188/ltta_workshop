hi everyone and welcome back to my
channel what our hope you guys are
having a good day now for today's video
honestly I was not expecting to be
thawing this sit in front of my camera
right now and trying on a bunch of
clothes so basically everybody I was
just having like a normal day and walked
into my bedroom opened up my wardrobe
and honestly I was so shocked my
wardrobe was like a destroyed there it
was tidy yeah it was actually quite nice
I leave you freaked out I was like oh my
goodness mom makes somebody has stolen
my clothes I was just so confused I was
like what is going on and it turns out
my mom has replaced my wardrobe with
seven different outfits for seven days
of the week she thinks that she knows my
style better and she didn't actually set
herself a budget as well what was the
budget well I went a little bit over it
so it wasn't really really expensive no
it's all--it's she from the look like
the kind of mind blowing like a sauce is
going so I would leave everything down
below if you guys do like it but
obviously I haven't actually I
completely seen everything yeah because
I opened up the first thing I did was
freaked out and I ran to my mama's and
what the hell I'm confident the most but
there are one or two things I am
thinking when I arrived I thought oh the
picture and because you're quite sure
there's gonna be really hard yeah I had
the supermodel eggs or anything so I
think anyway why these things my mom's
in tape oh hi everyone
so basically I've stolen stuff with the
camera yesterday we spoke about doing a
video together about a clothing
challenge video I'm spending on so much
of certain shops from bra but I decided
while we had this conversation that I
was gonna actually surprise her and buy
her a whole new wardrobe so I've ordered
a whole new wardrobe yesterday morning
it's all arrived today she doesn't know
she's out having a driving lesson so
when she gets home basically her whole
wardrobe is gonna be completely emptied
and filled up with just the stuff that I
want her to wear for at least the next
week okay so here I am in seconds
bedrooms and this is her wardrobe and
this is what it looks like now she's got
quite a lot of stuff in that and she's
got loads and loads of shoes so
basically I'm gonna clear all of this
out and I'm gonna leave her one or two
pairs of shoes that I feel like she
should wear with the outfits that she's
going to have this week
and there we go the finished look
everyone I am super excited and nervous
for this video I really hope you guys
enjoy it much a big thumbs up let's try
and guess I'm sitting yes
yeah take it along a long long time
so mum interesting idea joy so here is
outfit in a balloon everybody this is
outfit number one so this is definitely
a little bit different to what I would
normally work I'm actually really
feeling it mum what made you buy this
out cuz I feel like I really like it I
feel like this like very different what
I'm normally word you know I mean yeah
when I saw the leggings and I just
thought I know you hate wearing jeans
all the time I know that way yeah yeah I
hate wearing the same saw and you yeah
that mustard yellow and so do i so I've
got one for then but I did want to see
it I thought I mean if a boo boo who's
cheap cheerful isn't it they're quite a
thin and not as you know thing is I
thought but I really like them and then
when I saw this I was like okay so I'm
thinking in the summer you don't have to
wear the best job you could just have
the little crop top
muchas partes reasons so I thought your
best I don't want to keep writing Omega
bar owners yeah it would I can the
trainers I think we're I'm gonna give
this an eight I go everybody here is
outfit number two so my thoughts are
good so far I've been really feeling it
mum told me the whole outfit head-to-toe
is from misguided Tamar you want to wink
work my my case for a day outfit a
motorboat wear these heels look I don't
know I want but maybe not around town
did I mean no I think we're going out
for a lunch or something but I'm really
feeling it I feel like this is why kind
of thing work
I love camo I love edgy when I first
opened them I didn't really like the
fabric of the camo Johnnie's feel like
they feel really cheap if they're like
party outfit trousers but they look good
that she don't really look good so
everyone I'm gonna give it the first
outfit and 9 out of 10 I don't really
think she can't beat that
let's give it a go I'll bet another
three
so marmots walk us through this one okay
well this one is a casual trainer day
kind of one I really liked this jump I
really like the color it's really
different so you like this outfit yeah I
love it
however I'm gonna have to mark you down
a little bit cuz these are my trainers
yep it wasn't just that hang on the top
so the tops from this part the jeans are
from ASOS yeah and the trainers they're
obviously bands and therefore makes us
but no they're not but you can get them
from a sauce so I feel like I would have
bought them and I did you've got them
for Christmas with Casey but I actually
said to Casey you should get Stephanie
trainers so I did choose those trainers
I don't know it was so worthless he's
not annoying like I want it to happen
but like why is she doing so well she's
short better than I do
it's on me so annoying I'm gonna give
you a knife wear this 10 yeah but I
would have done and I did choose them I
can't attend she's doing good so far so
far what the hell is this I have no idea
mom you was trying to make this away
right yeah right see ya know I
tracksuits
they not they're super comfy but who
wants tracksuit bottoms like these the
quiet love trousers open you know what I
thought they look nice you know what I
thought they'd look this is the outfit I
was dreading because I thought ya know
you know you know the sort look really
cool and actually you could probably
make a photos you have a vote for these
you can we make it look really good and
the t-shirt is super cute
the t-shirt I said what I wear something
out I am having to wear this out I have
to go out in this outfit can we just get
a thumbs up for that things turn around
let's have a look at the side yeah it's
not my fault you're super sure
okay I'll give this one my tent
I don't told you how much ha I will give
is my heart oh yeah let's go for two men
to help escapes looks like you actually
never want to eyes out again my copy but
making me go out like this mom they're
cute the top both yes so everyone this
has to be my favorite outfit I think of
all of them I love this one I think I
like it just as much the second one so
this is what it looks like
I love it Thanks this is the kind of
thing you could even wear like flat
knee-high boots with this as well yeah
like yeah one just might normal do same
thing
yeah so this is like Gucci inspired yeah
as I sell fake Gucci miss Mack I really
like the skirts yes and then the skirt
is then it's got the poppers down the
side there it looks really cute why did
you / use the same shoe I couldn't
afford to keep buying shoes for
everything no I couldn't and also like
there's loads of each equip I think
actually putting look-alike trainers to
be fair yeah I think I look quite cool
maybe put white tights but I mean I like
I'm the high trainers it's not really
cool that's so this has to be a 10 if
it's your favorite 10 I have it loving
this bracelet and clad when I'm going to
go party you're gonna rock out in this
one I've had to get going out outfit so
yes she's a mom's shoes but you could
wear a gold fancy shoes well yeah we
don't have them in our collection right
now and this is so flattering because
the way it's got the elastic and stuff
around me things over I thought you can
eat both hey do look slim yeah you know
just in there you can't see it
yeah it looks good I love it 10 out of
10 she's beginning to really really
annoy me now because they are just
looking too good then it's so
frustrating like mom can you stop I
flooded the outfit though it's
definitely not everybody's cup of tea
but she has got me spot on like I love
this so much so this is just a really
really smart feel like I put you too
many heeled outfits
you know you want to look nice oh just
from the bar yeah love it it's not Bluff
luck so what you're gonna give this oh
give it another I really don't know
mommy oh no no no you're lost babe if
you don't subscribe actually feel winner
you dad you did okay right everyone so
this is the last outfit
I really like the trousers if I actually
I really like all of it the quality of
this I'm on the side because it won't be
the best quality of everything I've
tried so far as well obviously about to
use the same trainers again but I feel
like this sack you know really good with
hair was as well so yeah let me know
