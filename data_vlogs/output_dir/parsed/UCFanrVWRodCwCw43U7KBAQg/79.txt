box
this is what I first open and I was like
had to the yes so I got this Victoria's
Secret pocket and I ripped it open
and in side because I love that like
sport where it's amazing so I got this
sports bra which is so so so nice I love
the zip and then also it's like crossed
at the back I love this so much it also
has like extra padding inside which I
like as well because I hope people think
it's weird when I wear a bra then I also
wear a sports bra I just really like the
extra protection so this is great so I
don't have to wear bra people don't have
to have a go at me for hangover R as
well so I got this and then we match
with their I bought these and gym
leggings which are the best thing ever
because you know guys will obviously sit
in the New Year's resolutions - to be
healthy and fit so I'm going to be at
the gym and living at the gym for we
last the week but you know so I got
these gym leggings and they also are my
favorite in leggings because they make
you look so slim and they make subtle
got back in and it's honest so I got
these and they're like high-waisted and
they're really nice they're grey again I
could really the kind of a light wash
gray and then they have I don't really
know how to explain this what really
gives is it's like criss cross but it's
really pretty and it's like down the
side of the leg so I'm loving it so that
was the first thing I got from my mom
and my dad so mom I took off my mom and
dad this is like kind of my main present
even though all of it feels like I made
presents for me because I feel so lucky
so let's start with this one because
it's so exciting so my favorite designer
like in the entire world is Burberry so
I'm not even kidding guys opened it up
and here was this berber bag and I was
like oh my goodness I'm very mad I
haven't asked like for anything from
Burberry and I know immediately like it
couldn't be a scarf because I thought
well they're like what was in the
thinnest I thought don't have it's a bag
or less that so I got this bag here and
it's so unit so nice you guys know me I
if you do know me you know that I love
Burberry but I've also just love red
like I love the color red so much is my
favorite color so it's like a red inside
it's got the red handles and I just
thought it was so sweet cuz I actually
don't own a handbag i actually only own
backpacks so like the second I opened it
up I freaked out and again you'll see
Mary
unlike my Christmas Day vlog let's check
it out Chiqui promo but it is a good
luck but yeah this is the bag and I feel
so so so lucky and so grateful so thank
you so so much my mom and dad for
getting me this because I love it my dad
like my dad's behind the cameras going
gasp okay so let's just put on the bag
so it's like neat let's put your box and
then another present for my mum and dad
I got this book arc mod which is
basically a vertical stand for like a
MacBook obviously you guys know like if
you follow my vlogs by Eddy it on a map
book and I just thought this was perfect
I thought it's gonna be so cute like my
side so this is what it looks like and I
just feel like my desk in my room it's
gonna look so cute
so I also love love love this present
but also like never really seen anything
like it before
and that's I might have seen like things
like this on Pinterest but never in real
life so I thought it was really really
really cool so I'm very excited to use
that so obviously guys that this did
have like a bow on it and it was like
wrapped up forever but now it's just
like in a silver box so I got from
Tiffany and Co again so grateful didn't
expect this in a million years
especially because I opened that were
you doing I was keep passing my more
presents thank you I've got no presents
so I opened my Burberry bag first and
then I opened this and I was like not
expecting it at all because obviously
the blue bag is like my main presence I
was like I'm not obviously not going to
get anything else like major big and
therefore it's not big but you know what
I mean it's it's a big prism so I opened
it up but it was a Tiffany and Co ring
so it came in like this little bag here
and I bought the earrings last year
which is so cute and bred to a little
close up right now but it says Tiffany
in Croatian it's so pretty I love it so
so much and I'm gonna work every single
day I'm gonna take it off because I'm so
forgetful
I lose everything and I really don't
wanna lose it Oh what is this so my
younger brother Jed I
believe him he's so cute yeah it's me
went out and bought me this
so it's from Victoria Secrets it's like
a really thick scarf and it's so sweet
obviously it's pink I'm red and it's so
catchy and it's perfect for the winter
and it's got like these red tassels as
well which is so sweet
so I'm a younger brother Jake got me
this scarf so thank you so much Jerry
I'm gonna drop everything I love it and
then another present from my parents
like what the heck I was so lucky this
year I've got some other boots I really
really really wanted these ugg boots
in fact I never actually asked for them
in like I asked for them like a brownie
base you cut up obviously I'm grateful
like whatever color they are those and
they are really super nice and I think I
might actually prefer the black I'm not
sure but it's basically I wanted these
short ugg boots I think they're so cute
and they're so catchy
and I used to having so many pairs and
like won't got older my feet have grown
and I've just never really bought any
scent and I just feel like they're so
like achieve for home I just wear them
at home all the time it's s so soft
inside but also I just love this side
gold zip here and then like we're kind
of breaks off here like the decal here
it's like so pretty so I'm really really
really loving these and I will get like
a lot and a lot of wear out of these
like I'm gonna take a stuff off now it's
my sneaker and like boiling on but those
are lights I got a Christmas jumper I've
got more presents so next up like ah
well yet the other place of that I got
so like I got like a really pretty box
next I didn't even I didn't even talk to
Alexa what the heck anyways so this was
the last president that I got for my mom
and dad and it was a like a really
pretty box and inside was some like
different clothes so I think she got
this from H&M because I really wanted to
get it myself so it's a black kimono and
it's got like flowers on the back and I
just think it's so pretty and I just
love love love
not only for nighttime because I feel
like a lot of people would wear this
answer like a robe for lifetime but
actually I would wear this like over
like a crop top or something like if I
was going at the evening because they're
really cold but also like this I don't
personally and if my biggest insecurity
is my arms so I love to wear like
jackets like this so I did get this
skirt always I've left the place of
upstairs where dad so I got this really
cute red suede skirt which was also in
the same box so this is what it looks
like and then it has like this kind of
like flowy top boy stop task words it's
like this flowy come a bear I'm on the
side and then it has a desert where you
zip up and down but I just thought this
is so pretty and I really really really
like this and I'm most probably when
it's actually with that kimono maybe
like a black crop top or something so I
did get that I'm trying to like calm
down so I'm just so excited I'm like
such a kid on Christmas - hey so I've
got this like really cute like pretty
pink best job it has like little dime
aunty's and then I don't really know how
to explain this there's a word for it I
can't think it's just a greedy pretty
detailing in France but this is really
pretty pink desktop and then the last
thing for my mom and dad which I didn't
include because I basically I tried it
on upstairs I know I did say that was
the last but it isn't there's there's
more so the very last thing that I did
get from my parents is this Fred suede
place ooh this is so pretty it's
actually from Zara and I'm actually
gonna wear this for Boxing Day I know
it's really hard to show you here but
you guys I'm sure you'll see a lot of
pictures of me wearing this on my
Instagram and stuff because I'm
definitely gonna wear it tomorrow and
I'm so excited to wear it but it like
really really really matches that sky
like that red suede skirt that I got and
there aren't you from different shops
and then they use that same color road
but eyes beautiful and I love it so so
much we're kind of getting to the end of
like everything I got now I did get a
present from my older brother Casey his
girlfriend ecole and their little baby
Harlow so I got this vans box and
already I was like super excited that's
what I was going to get into my
checkered vans again because I keep
having to get new ones because like I
have the front of Walmart
and then like they get really dirty and
like I'm so obsessed I won't say much
but they wasn't they are so nice though
and I love them even more than my
checked band so they're these like pale
pink bands however they're like really
really really shiny
they look like velvet but they
definitely are and then they have this
like tiger and this like a flower on the
front it really kind of reminds me of
like the Gucci like patent and logo that
they have I think it's really really
really cool and they are very me and
they fit because everything I've got my
dad like I go in with pair of shoes and
they don't fit it was so sad but these
fit me so that's one good thing so yeah
I got that from Casey Nicole and Harlow
I was actually going to show you guys
everything I've got in my sack as well
which is like little bits and bobs
little extra bits but things I needed
like face wipes and body wash and just
like might you've got some really cool
handy things as well I did at your met
