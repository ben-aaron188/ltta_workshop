let's get into the video walks faster
this is something I would definitely
love truth even though I had to
personally bore myself so this is a
light-up
star box I think this is so so so cute
it's $12.99 in this from new look and I
just think it's so sweet because firstly
I just love light up boxes in general
but this is you know that little bit
extra also it's really sweetly and
actually make it personalized for
somebody so if I was a boy and I was
like this is my girlfriend that I could
write I love you on it or this for your
best friend you can write besties or
whatever it can also be for your aunties
your sister-in-law whoever you feel like
giving it to you know I feel like this
definitely is a present for everybody
and it really isn't too expensive either
next up is actually my favorite of the
bunch I think this is the coolest thing
and what I've done all of this I kind of
have my dad in mind but you know what I
actually bought this myself what I have
got in myself and I'm definitely going
to be using it I genuinely think it's
the coolest thing ever so it's called a
scratch map so you can get a black one
or you can get this kind of like crazy
kind of nudie one and then they're both
so so lovely so basically you guys know
that I literally love to travel and what
you do so you scratch your flat with a
coin you just scratch up where you've
been so it literally has every single
country and state weather and also guys
if you don't travel like the world or
whatever and you haven't been to that
many other countries apart or like
outside the UK if you're from the UK
then you can actually get like a smaller
version of this it's just
UK which I also think is so cool because
I've got you've been took quite a lot
places in the UK now but not everywhere
so it's making me want to go and visit
the rest of the place where I live and
so to say with this really that's what
it looks like oh my goodness
so no eyes you know what I love black
and gold so first of all I do think that
this is going to look so so so pretty on
my wall
it's literally huge folks it has every
single country there is so I don't know
what I felt like I had been to so many
countries and I have like I know I'm
really really really grateful and have
been to loads of places but looking at
this yeah I haven't been to that many
countries like actually looking at the
entire world when you actually scratch
it off it grows like a different color
like blue green right or whatever so it
kind of makes stands out so again like I
think it looks so pretty but yeah this
is definitely a present for literally
anyone guys girls whoever dad's
granddad's auntie's you know you get the
gist
why this is so so so nice oh it's almost
12 99 from home scents and then this one
I actually got from Amazon and it was
999 right I kind of need to explain
myself for this one because I'm actually
kind of smashed it I'm the clumsiest
person that has ever ever ever ever
existed so this is actually the cutest
mark you may ever see but not only is it
adorable wait so practical so let's open
it this up the pretty much it is a funny
mark which is it funny
yeah funny mug which i think is so cute
this is what I mean I actually like
smashed the ear off I'm such a Knorr
anyways I feel like it's a great great
great gift because it's like you know
some of the drinks a lot of tea or
coffee
aka my mom or Tyler hey you never know
then this is great because it won't get
cold because the month actually has a
lid how cool is that like that is
genuinely so cool it looks so much nicer
though when the is actually on where
there you go there yeah that's that so
no I just think that it's fallen
anyway should get the gist it's really
three and it's actually really practical
as well because your tea won't get cold
oh my goodness I love the next item as
well
I kind of love everything you know but
these I magical talk the same thing
because I love both and I was like
have no idea which one to get so I ended
up getting both as you do so these are
called
heat and huh these are the cushions that
you put in the microwave but for like a
lot of you guys would have seen this
before normally they're like Teddy
versions though but these ones are a lot
bigger and they are so so so soft but
you can actually like cuddle up to these
put them on your bed you know so I got
this pineapple one which is so sweet and
then I also got this one oh my gosh this
is like a big donut like it's actually
so big and I just feel like that would
fit my bed so nicely so so so sweet he's
at one $9.99 and again great for your
friend your auntie but also for like my
niece and nephew would love those
definitely how to my brother in mind
when I got these so these are ice carps
aka chocolate cups they are the best
chocolate ever honestly they taste
amazing which you have one you're not
stopping like honestly I'm not kidding
these are the best chocolates and then
so colorful and so festive
and I just love the big Java that in as
well so again I was kind of like on the
splurge of a moment like HomeSense had
everything they was killing the game so
I got this from home cents and they were
$12.99 actually there is a ton in there
however you know what I feel like
there's a a few missing on the top so I
say I have my brother in mind for these
well I think somebody has actually eaten
some actually remmaneh
I don't want open it because I know I'm
gonna smell them on want to eat them I
feel like Jetstar to this this point
maybe not myself in the face this anok's
gift is a really Christmassy and
gimmicky kind of gift it's one of those
things that you just really wouldn't go
out by yourself so it's a really lovely
gift to receive and I feel like it's
great fun so you guys may have seen this
on my Christmas wish list cuz I BA like
everybody wants one of these she's just
never going to go out and buy one
yourself
so this is a smartphone projector I
don't necessarily know this is gonna
work because it is actually pretty cheap
it's $12.99 so for what it is I don't
know if it's gonna work but it looks
really cool you kind of like make the
whole box up you put your phone inside
and your fingers crossed low it works
but like for me personally like when I
have my friends over for a movie look I
don't have
TV so if I'm like watching a movie I
have to watch on my laptop but it's just
a bit like it kind of sucks so to have
this if we really call books you should
projector anymore so I just feel like
this is a really cool game again it can
literally be for anybody guys definitely
be sure to check out my vlogging channel
because I'm gonna be trying it on there
and it was $12.99 did I mention that I'm
sure as you guys seem clearly quite see
it's another personalized gift and you
guys now know that I love personalized
gifts so as you can see on the front of
this passport holder it has like a
sparkly ass which I just think is that
the cutest thing ever it's so pretty and
I bought a passport holder from Victoria
Secrets and it really cost about 50
pounds there's this $4.99 I thought what
a bargain and inside it has like card
holders and stuff as well so has like a
little section for cards and you get
your passport inside so this I thought
was a really lovely gift and it
obviously has like every letter of the
alphabet you can get any letter for
anybody and even if you're not I travel
oh you're probably gonna have a
passports if you do this is just a
lovely thing to keep it you know you
wanted to know pretty now this gift here
is definitely the sweetest gift for this
book clearly says dear grandma from you
to me but you can get these for your
obviously your now and your granddad or
you can get it for your mum and dad also
so this book is called from you to me
and you can pretty much get it from
anywhere you can get them from Amazon
you can get them from wherever you know
I got my from Amazon and it was 10
pounds and why so so lovely is say for
example this one says dear grandma so I
would give this to my Nana and inside
she would fill out all the questions
about herself and it literally has every
single thing about had that it's aunts I
know I feel like a lot of the older
generation thought things like this you
obviously love looking back on your life
it's so so so nice that's what I love
looking because I get to look back on so
much of my life and sometimes you know I
like you jog a memory you like oh my
goodness I remember that day that was
amazing
so if I like this book is really gonna
jog back some memories it's really sweet
so I see fun to fill out and then your
grandma or whoever composite back down
and you know you can rest of the family
can look at it and I just think it's
such a sweet gift and it's obviously so
much fun to fill it all out as well so
I'm just gonna open one up now just so
you know I can read some out to give you
an example so this one says what do you
remember about the place or places you
lived when you
a child well all your favorite childhood
toys or games so some like that I just
think is so so so lovely I feel like I
don't really know that much about my
Nana granters child over because there's
probably so many stories so I feel like
this is just a great way that they can
just write all of them in here I can
read them you know I can pass it down
and can just get past some generations
so you know like your kids might know I
don't have kids yet but for how the kids
like they could look at my great-grandma
what she was like when she was a child
for an example so I just think this is
so lovely you guys know how much I love
my grandparents so for me this is the
best gift definitely showed something
very similar like this in Lash's home
gift guide so this is another thing that
could be personalized or quickly as you
can see it's whole new look so it's kind
of like the matching gold with the star
which i think is so sweet so you can
definitely put them together such a nice
present
anyways so as you can see this is a
really pretty picture frame and really
love the pattern behind and I just love
the gold so inside as you can see is
like little clips with like pictures
these pictures are actually really
lovely I feel like you could personalize
it you can put in sales for your best
friend put a picture of you and your
best friend you know clip them in its
really sweet or you can leave it to them
to do or your boyfriend or whoever or
you can even just you know put whatever
pictures you want to in like these
pictures I think are actually really
sweet and really nice as well so you
know whatever but again it can be
another personalized gift I just feel
like wanna see personalized gifts are
just so much more meaningful and
thoughtful and just so so so lovely
especially when you don't have the
budget to go and buy like a really
expensive gift then you know a more
personalized gift is definitely more
thoughtful I love gifts like that I'm
sure you guys do too
anyways we on to our last gift now these
are called instant coasters so these
were $8.99 and again these so sweet as
you can clearly see they're coasters
that you can personalize yourself so
basically you just get a picture cut it
to size put it inside the coaster that's
really sweet now my brother and his
girlfriend
how about house so this is a great gift
I think because they just have like a
newborn baby so - like maybe putting
like a little picture of her you know
it's just really sweet in their house
and I feel like they would definitely
love that gift or
again I don't know if it's for yourself
or it's for a friend and you don't
really like that sort of thing you know
when you want pictures of yourself or
friends or whatever uh-huh
then you can definitely put like I don't
known I'd really pretty quo or a nice
patent or whatever you know so this I
just think it's such a cool gift I'm
gonna get one out
oh there's actually so nice it's all oh
wait do you know you can also do as it
has that strict down the bottom cuz
there was that my brothers babies would
Harlow you can maybe like I don't know
it serves the picture of when she was
born you could like write the date that
she was born are you come out like a
little message as well and another bonus
thing about these as well as I thought
it was gonna be plastic but they're
actually glass so yeah they were $8.99
that were from some card shop really I
actually literally cannot think and
won't come to my brain I can't remember
what card shop they're from but I will
