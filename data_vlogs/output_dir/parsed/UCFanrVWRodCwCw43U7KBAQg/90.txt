hello everybody and happy Christmas so
I'm so so so excited because this is my
first Christmas video of 2017 like what
the Frick is finally here I am so so so
happy because what I see Christmas is my
favorite time of the year
okay guys technically it's not actually
here yet but it's coming it's coming so
I'm super super super excited so we're
gonna kickstart the Christmas videos
with a Christmas Advent haul so I've
been really lucky because I've been
gifted quite a lot of calendars from
different brands some of these I've
actually gone out and bought myself just
because I really wanted to try them and
I thought this video be really helpful
for you guys if you're undecided on what
calendar you want to get this year or a
matter of fact if you didn't enjoy
watching these videos because I really
enjoy them I get really intrigued to see
what's inside because I know some
calendars a really expensive so it's
like is it worth the money majority of
the calendars that I've got just like
Beauty so they are gonna be more
expensive but you would expect that so I
hope you guys do enjoy spend a big
thumbs up if you guys do I look quickly
how flippin cute is my Christmas jumper
I am in love I love it so so much I'll
link you down below for you guys but
also I am going to do another big
Christmas jumper haul so look up them so
the first kind of done I'm gonna start
with is a body shop kinda I am so so so
excited because I really wanted they
calendars last year because so many
people was raving about it so this year
I've actually got the chance to get my
hands on actually more than one because
they do do three different calendars
they do one for 45 pounds which is the
lowest price one for 65 which I believe
is this one and then they do want looks
a little bit more expensive as well it
obviously has a bit more in it I'm not
exactly sure how much that is and why
don't you be 85 but think it goes up in
twenties so I've got this one which is
in the middle so hopefully it should be
really good I think it looks so so
pretty though I know this calendar is
quite pricy but I feel like it's totally
worth it because I also feel like it's a
gift for somebody like I would rather
this is like an early Christmas present
and have another Christmas present under
the tree because it just looks a whole
lead-up to Christmas so exciting that's
what I love plus then you get a gift
every single day so let's actually get
inside is actually worth a hundred
and sixteen pounds so they go you
actually get your money's worth
so you open it up and this genuinely is
the coolest kinder I think I have
actually seen because it's actually
boxes which i think is so much nicer
because it really looks at like it looks
so much more special than just an
average one so I'm I'm gonna suck on
infinite so okay let's go for a round a
box I don't know I always go for the
biggest ones but right we're gonna go
for thirteen it's quite a big box I
don't know if the other ones I've got a
forum outline is it yeah oh it's not a
there you go just kind of like to slid
down as you guys can see a body shop
British Rose instant glow a body butter
and this is really good size like I was
expected like really small but this
would actually last you like this is oh
my god it's also good as well general
it's so nice is that mini stuff is it
like super super mini so it really does
feel like you are getting your money's
worth
okay I'm gonna take out a couple more
let's go for number 14 this is a camera
mile makeup remover crime they're open
at 24 because it is actually 25 days
majority of calendars don't go up to 25
days so that's another great thing about
this one and this is huge what the hell
this is like this is not a mini this is
a full-size product this is so good so
this is a I think it's a body butter
yeah must be right buddy what's up oh my
goodness this smells amazing
Oh what the hell this is almond milk and
honey for sensitive and dry skin have a
look at that I actually genuinely think
is amazing this is worth the money in my
opinion like this is definitely a big
big thumbs up thanks calendar is a soap
& Glory calendar and again liquid love
the packaging love how much this really
really really stands out it's a 24-day
calendar it's 40 pounds so again I feel
like what I really really really hope
that we do get our money's worth I think
it looks super super super cute though
I'm upset about it's nuts
so again I'm just gonna open
once we are gonna go for number 19 here
and have a look inside so this isn't too
big what is it I don't know this is a
fresh and foamy body wash so this is
super cute I really like the fattest
Asajj shape is it'll be different and I
really thought I could get much product
inside but let's have a look at another
one open another one do that's actually
a lot better because that's actually
decent size and by the way I'm loving
that kind of definitely want to get hold
of that I'm gonna have a look at the
back chitta wasn't of a great thing
about this I don't really like calendars
that have a picture of everything you're
gonna get that's gonna be kind of ruins
it but at the same time if you're
undecided and what calendar to get and
you're like I don't know if it's
actually worth the money is good because
I thought this one has all the writing
so it does have everything that is
inside up here so it says what the whole
give pack includes but it doesn't
actually show the pictures which I think
it's nice up said it's more surprise and
you actually open them up so again I
think this is really good I think I
would have to kind of like try out a
little bit more to see the sizes it's
not as big as the body shop one but
again is a little bit less expensive but
also I do think it is super super super
cute so this is the NYX calendar it's
called countdown and it's a 24-day
advent calendar as well I also think the
pack all of these packaging is so cute
like I love it so much so this is also
super super super cute the only thing
with this calendar I mean I literally
love it because you guys know how much
I'm obsessed with lipstick like I can't
go a day without lipstick so this
calendar is literally perfect for me but
if you're not off massive fan on
lipstick and you definitely not gonna
like this calendar because that's kind
of all it consists of so this is 50
pounds which again does seem like quite
a lot of money but if you actually walk
it out that's about 2 pound of lipstick
and you're not going to get a NYX
lipstick for two pounds so really you
are getting a good deal
roll so let's hope that the size of the
half-decent though so okay let's go for
number 16 open this bad boy up
this one is a intense and butter gloss
so it is actually a lot smaller than I
was expecting it to be but oh my
goodness this color is so nice I rather
such a pretty nude so it is actually a
lot smaller than I expected it to be how
I feel like you still probably wouldn't
get us 40 pound and hopefully he does
have like quite a bit of product
actually inside if you guys do really
love lipstick and just love makeup in
general I really just want to venture
out and try more like fun things with
your makeup then this is definitely a
great talent just to get because clearly
you've got a lot of different lipstick
colors that you've got bright Purple's
Reds pink nudes grays and greens like
you have a built everything so you never
know like you might try one of these try
a green lipstick I think actually I love
that and that is worth getting so I
think it is a really good way to like
venture out and come out of your comfort
zone and try new lipsticks that you
never really thought you'd have the
chance to buy because to buy a big one
might be really expensive so I thought
this is a really really really good way
to like venture out you know this one is
definitely a tease because it is
actually sold out so I do apologize
beforehand
however on my Twitter I'm actually gonna
be giving a calendar exactly like this
or what obviously not this one I am
gonna be giving a calendar just like
this away from kales so be sure to go
and follow my Twitter to be in the
chance of winning this kinda so it is
actually 95 pounds so again it is a
little bit more expensive however this
one I know for a fact is definitely
worth it because it is actually worth so
much more than 95 pounds and plus kills
products are amazing they are such an
amazing skinny care brand so first of
all again it looks so so pretty I really
like the fact that this actually looked
a gift wrapped like it's really heavy so
it must actually have like great things
inside so I'm going to undo the bow and
have a look so this is a 24-day advent
calendar I'm gonna open it 21 have a
look oh my gosh if I get this out wait
okay here we go so this one is a oldest
the mask this is nice
most the face mask it smells really good
the thing is with the kills face mask
you know it's actually gonna work like
it's genuinely gonna help your skin it's
so much sucks up such a good skincare
brand even if you can't get hold of that
calendar
definitely recommend them as a brand
because they are amazing
and by the way I don't actually want to
open any of the others because mom and I
are so excited about this that we do
actually want to open it a day at a time
so I'm going to leave this one but yeah
if you guys want to have a chance of
actually winning one then be sure to
head over to my doctor this is the lush
calendar the last calendar always looks
very very very big it's always a very
big calendar it's really cute it looks
very similar to last year to be honest
it's the same kind of like shape the
same hexagon shade I really like what it
looks like from the outside well the
only thing with this lush color is to me
it's not really like an advent calendar
because inside it's up as possible it
smells absolutely amazing the only thing
is is there's only like six different
boxes so there'd be like two lush
products in each one so it's not like
everyday you can like open a door or on
a box of products so that's kind of
annoying thing with this kind of day
it's more like a gift but it is an
amazing gift like this is such a lovely
lovely lovely present so coming through
exactly how much this was I think it's
like 40 or 45 pounds so actually it's
really really really not that expensive
considering what you get inside because
you actually get full products of
everything so you get beautiful bath
bombs so good this one is actually my
favorite bath bomb of all time like it
is amazing in the bath these three gold
stars and shoot out gold
it's literally like incredible however
it would take you a long time to wash
your bath after but it's so worth it all
oh my goodness I forgot you get this so
Snow Fairy is actually their best seller
from lush and it's a shower gel and it's
literally if you a lot of shower gel
after using this it's the best thing
ever
it smells amazing and it only comes out
for Christmas time so this is beautiful
it's great that they have that in there
as well so they have a lot of their best
sellers they have really big amazing
bath bombs like oh my goodness I've
never seen that one before definitely
didn't have this last year that is so
nice I love that the smells beautiful so
they have a bubble bars they have
like creams the shower gels they have
lots of like amazing things so what's
the money pull over to me it's not
really like an advent calendar it's just
more like a gift so there was one thing
lash I wish you could change about it
was that you actually get to like open
it up I just think it's more exciting
there's no really order and how you do
it but it is a really really amazing
present I'm really not too pricey
considering what you do get inside then
a fit advent calendar and this is the
winter 1/2 glam which by the way I love
that this is actually a 12 day calendar
again he does this super cute it's a bit
annoying then it's only 12 days but
hopefully the products inside will make
up for it and it is actually the
cheapest out all the ones that I have
shown you so far so this is 3040 and
also another great thing about this
calendars you do get a lot of their
bestsellers so you get their
Porefessional primer that hoola bronzer
that they are real mascara you get some
pro products skin products so you kind
of get like a full face of makeup as
well which is great because again if you
are kind of unsure about trying their
products because I know if you've never
spent 20 pounds on a mascara before it
might be like is it really worth it so
you can try out their little mini
mascaras and see if you'd like to see if
it is worth it so I feel like it's
definitely a great great great calendar
to get and it probably is one of my
favorites also okay actually I know I've
kind of said this about everyone but I
think this one does excite me the most
out of all of them
it isn't the best one of sim visually I
think it's a little bit basic if
anything a bit too basic up I bought the
products inside are really really really
gonna make up for it I love Clinique as
a brand I just think they are so amazing
I use them every single daily so this
also has a beauty and skincare incite so
we're gonna have a look at that let's
open one of them up we're gonna go for
number 11 which is this one here right
this is obviously this is actually a
decent size as well so this is a hand
cream I love a good hand cream because I
feel like I never actually go out and
buy them I always forget but they are
actually so useful and so hard to just
go put this on my hands actually my
hands have really dry hmm that's not
really nice comedy walk out what it is
but it does smell nice but I'm just
gonna open up one more I'm gonna open up
three oh my goodness I'm dropping it so
inside this one you get a black eye
pencil which is really nice so you get a
makeup product and this is 75 pounds
again and I feel like they are actually
like decent sizes though so I feel like
you are kind of getting your money's
worth so this is another calendar that I
definitely would recommend looking on
the picture on the back you get a makeup
brush which is really good I think
because brushes excite me so much you
get blush ah you get a lot of skincare
lipsticks eye cream serum so kind of a
game you get a bit of everything mascara
face wash so this kind of does every
trick so everybody that wraps up my
favorite advic hundres of 2017 with some
of my all-time favorite products also so
if you've got any of these if you get
any of these definitely let me know down
below and let me know your best calendar
that you guys have ever ever ever tried
