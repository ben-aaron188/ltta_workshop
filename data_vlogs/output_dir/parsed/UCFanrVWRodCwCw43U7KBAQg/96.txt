hi everybody welcome back to my channel
I hope you guys are doing well as you
guys can see I'm back in my autumn no
room shall I call that I'm back I love
it so much it's such a beautiful day
right now I hope it is wherever you guys
are I remember is the dance is actually
uploaded because if not you know but
right now is actually so nice it's like
it's no bit chilly but it's still like
the sun's out and it's just it's so
lovely as for my favorite favorite
favorite times of the year so today I'm
gonna be talking about my top ten beauty
favorites under 10 pounds so the reason
I wanted to do this video it sounds a
little bit more affordable for you guys
you know you'd have to go out on
defensible it's like 50 pound a bottle
all the way under 10 pounds in fact
majority of it I think actually under 5
pounds as well and genuinely besides my
favorite product I really hope you guys
do enjoy this video and if you're to see
more like this you know what to do smell
like and subscribe down below if you
guys haven't already and let's get into
the video I hope you guys enjoy what we
first but I don't want to talk about I
feel like I've spoken about it quite a
lot so don't want to go on about it too
long this is the e45 cream I feel like I
feel really really really lucky if my
skin is quite good and I feel like
honestly is many down to this stuff but
I don't use it my skin tends to break
out there's only by Park 54 this huge
pot and honestly this loves me like a
month a month what I do with it
obviously it's a moisturizer but I
actually wash my face with it so if you
just scoop a little bit out rub it on my
face and rinse it of water and that's it
honestly it's helped my skin so much and
I thought like it would work with any
skin also definitely should give it a go
if you suffer with like my skin
oh and it's quite good actually like
washing your makeup off as well you guys
recently know that I cut my hair and
honestly is quite thin it still is thin
if I wanna see it's thickened so much
all down to this shampoo and conditioner
it's by L'Oreal it really isn't too
pricy you guys actually recommended this
to me because I remember just like tweet
now on Twitter
cuz that's what you do I treated you
guys like oh what should I use like how
my hair to thicken it and so many of you
guys recommended this I'm on my second
of each one right now honest thing is
help my hair so much it feels so much
healthier so this is the L'Oreal vibrato
G air volumizing thickening
conditioner and shampoo and is the best
thing ever
I've spent so much money on hair
products to just have it worked and
these are drugs are a lot more
affordable definitely why I would go and
check now and again I will leave links
like the best deals and stuff I can find
down below
I think super drugs probably the best I
think I rent out store at the moment
guys they're actually doing half price
as well so depending on why you want to
go there's always deals on as well okay
so sticking with hair my favorite dry
shampoo okay I just know the little
don't you just love that ago the lids
just too fast so this is that was our
medieval ghost that just lit up but
thanks for that best dry shampoo
literally no joke I've tried so many
trash shampoos as well and then I just
went through sage you're just not using
them because I just thought well they
don't really work and the enginee end up
making my hair look more greasy because
it just has so much product in it until
forties then one day 72 like my PA box
they're dry shampoos and literally and
never look back so thank you so much for
sending me them because I'm honestly
obsessed and I always take one in my
handbag right now I guess it's just a
normal one it's fruity and cheeky and
it's pretty good this is what it's no
that makes a difference for you guys and
then this one here which I'm definitely
loving at the omen and I've argued
definitely should have applied before
this video but this one here is the dry
shampoo plus it's a little bit more
expensive this one was three pounds but
I could get it for hard price today so
go me yeah so again pretty affordable
but this one actually has London air as
well so it is really cool because if
you've got brew she can kind of just
Freight I can't see what I'm doing but
straight the top of your hair and you
kind of like covers up roots and stuff
and it is actually really flippin good I
do they also do one for brunette hair as
well and also if you don't like to wash
your hair like every single day like I
don't then that's definitely something
to give a go so my new love at the
moment guys is by the body shop which
let's face it is a British version of
Bath and Body Works and you can't not
love it like is amazing I love the brand
so much I've recently just discovered
their new autumnal
collection which by the way I am
obsessing over
specially this here so this is the
vanilla pumpkin it's our Chow and it
literally smells divine I actually use
it in a big bath yesterday as well they
kind of went bubbled up and it just it
smell so good so this is definitely one
I would recommend obviously it's under
10 pounds pretty affordable and it
doesn't even look like I've used
anything but I actually have they do
like a whole collection as well that's
really really really good I think a
couple of the creams are a little bit
bigger so I think they're a little bit
more expensive yeah definitely go try
this because it smells so good if you
guys are pretty lazy when it comes to
washing your makeup off just like I am
like sometimes see you 45 cream won't
completely wipe all of your mascara away
so if that is the case and you're quite
lazy you like face wipes I have a
feeling you might be changing over to
these so these are bone dipping fab they
are these gentle at face pads and they
are actually really gentle like they're
really good for like sensitive skin but
they literally work miracles when it
comes to open your makeup off because
one side of the pad it's like is holy a
tang and then the other side is like a
really like soft it's kind of like a
white just like a better version because
honestly your makeup disappears like it
vanishes right they're really good
they're quite expensive I mean the under
10 pounds but there are a lot more
expensive than you know your average
face white but as I said a little
quicker and you do get 60 pads inside as
well so I mean we go i perfer these face
wipes now staying with that nip and fab
if you guys are looking for primer under
10 pounds another one I recommend is
this one and it is well it's just their
primer you serious that oh you can with
it they do because it just says nipping
fat primer but it is like this it's got
like a monochrome packaging it's really
good I can't exactly remember the price
up there I know it's under 10 pounds so
it's quite good because if it was kind
of like moisturizing on your skin I'm
pretty there's not really much to say
about it apart from the fact that it
does the job like it feels really nice
my makeup goes really nicely on it I
know my mom wants to use this as well
and she was finds that her makeup looks
like nice and smooth they actually sent
me this and honestly I'm like one of
those people that are like very stuck in
their own ways to find a lot of the
primers that I'm currently using or a
little bit more expensive and I never
would have brought you tried this out so
thank you so much for sending me this
because I will definitely use it and
have got quite a lot of user
all righty so thank you thank you hey
Jen you need feel like how you talk
about this all the time this is the
Maybelline cat eye mascara it is
absolutely amazing
I don't really see the point of spending
loads of money like on a really
expensive mascara because I feel like
majority of the drugstore mascaras are
just as good if not better anyways I am
obsessed with this mascara and I have
been from the day that I started makeup
this is one of the first mascara I
actually ever try so the brush is like
angled so it kind of like curves under
so especially when you're doing like
your bottom eyelashes it's so easy not
to get mascara underneath and it's just
just the way the brush is that angled
like Maybelline thank you so much
because I am like this is my go-to
mascara and always will be and it is one
to go and you're like you have to go buy
this
I feel like give them all of you guys
watch my daily vlogs or keep up with my
social media in hand if you don't have
definitely should but don't saying you
would have had me speak about this brand
a lot so this is girls with attitude I
am obsessed with the eyelashes they are
so good I've got a pair on right now and
I love them so much that they break what
the style that I buy is like very fluffy
and but they do a lot of styles but so
these are my favorite my favorite is
actually mythical and I really like
flaming girl as well they're really
really really really nice lashes I find
so much is the band is really hogs are
quite thick but these are braced in so
they're easy to put on so these are
probably my favorite eyelashes you can
buy under 10 pounds there's a lot of
other eyelashes that I do love and they
do wear a lot you know if I'm going to
Premier's himself I might wear maybe
more expensive a little bit thicker
lashes but definitely under 10 pounds
that these are my favorite that I've
ever tried and by the way you can get
them from one of my favorite stores
Primark
and you got to pick up my collection see
on the topic of eyelashes and stuff the
best glue you whatever use and I repeat
there is a no other glues that lives up
to Dubai and they do quite a few
different styles of joy right now this
one here is
actually the shoe open it's like a dark
tones that comes up black so when it
dries it just looks like eyeliner so
this was really good if you do have
eyeliner on I only have this one on me
otherwise I will show you all of them I
think they're all pretty much just as
good as each other
jus a eyelash glue honestly I never use
eyelash glue from any packet that I get
because nothing lives up to this like it
so it will last all day but it won't
feel like you're just ripping a whole
eyes off when you get it off and also
the good thing with like this one
obviously is really good when you are on
eyeliner and the clear one Mike it dries
clear within like five seconds max so
honesty is really really really good any
eyelashes will ask if you have this so
