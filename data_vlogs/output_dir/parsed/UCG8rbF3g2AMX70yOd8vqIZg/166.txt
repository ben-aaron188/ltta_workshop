baby tiger meets Kong I don't think
that's the tiger the tiger yeah no this
is not you guys you guys go this tiger
don't like vloggers are you in the low
game I put a subtitle even though I
didn't make noise he said yeah he says
yes okay look closely I'm going in I'm
going to try to touch the tiger
making noises like Kong Hey Oh I'm Logan
I'm a vlogger in it charge Oh Gibran he
does not like vloggers I got something
for you how about instead of chewing on
bamboo you chew on my hand dude it's
like a dog but a tiger just got a house
super cool think I'm gonna return the
house invest in baby tigers big business
support that to say he loves the
Maverick joggers they come out on
November first now you can't have him
yet
he loves like oh he's like he's like nah
I've been doing this thing look at the
camera and I go do you think you could
give it a shot oh he did it to me
brother
oh he's in camera attack mode he thinks
the microphone let's go check out our
boy and see what he's thinking
you mean Kong that's yeah - the real you
nervous oh yo just for all the animal
advocate people watching I'm gonna be
here to supervise this is a very
friendly tiger as you just saw we're
just gonna check the vibes but as you
can see I think Kong is ready bro my man
wants to meet his new friend Kong when I
got you I promise you you would live the
most absurd life ever and meeting a
tiger falls on that list do you think
he's gonna bark bro probably barks it
like he might growl bucks other dogs he
might growl it's how much of a savage
cone really is till it is nervous ruff
like I know Kong bro he makes friends
with people and dogs and tigers
callings not barking yet this is he's
just curious it's crazy he's like what
is it why does the tiger sound like a
dinosaur that's the thing do you think
come in say hi : yo this is crazy
you're the cat is guru he's like yo sir
oh that's a friendly sound
cause like I don't know I don't like
that Oh yo yo just quick Kong quick
sidebar how do you know listen no listen
no Kong that's a tiger so if you yeah
just gonna keep it calm Keep Calm okay
dude this is muggins Kong to savage like
is he crazy right now this is a big I
don't think I've seen Kong as on alert
as I have read yeah seriously he knows
something's up but he still wants to
play yo you are crazy
Tiger bro you gotta chill that's what
I've been saying let me translate he's
saying subscribe to Logan Paul vlogs yo
