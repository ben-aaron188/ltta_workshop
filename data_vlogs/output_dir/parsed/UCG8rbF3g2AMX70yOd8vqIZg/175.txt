determination from mindset of a freaking
toy pokeball comm /aa or Lincoln's
vision yeah did you bring food I'm so
hungry and dying Lydia also huh how do
you think those got there I'm assuming
you may have had something to do with it
you guys a mime or sick yes that's why
that's why I have goggles on here's the
issue going to the doctor I'm abroad you
breakfast in bed
Marek is walking like a dog how you but
to let that happen
call you always barking him but you're
not going to do anything about it you
good you good bro maverick what the fuck
are you doing your party supposed to fly
up there I've never seen him on the
ground you're crazy okay guys so the
plan right now Lydia scored me a
doctor's appointment I don't know how
you did this so quick good job Lydia go
to that hopefully they don't tell me I'm
dying cuz that's how I feel also how I
look according to you Lydia yeah Lydia
called me ugly nice ok so Brendan my man
Brendan had a crazy
we brought my boy Kong to SAP she hasn't
been as cute as he could be right no
okay yeah all of us had this realization
Kong has gotten ugly I know okay I know
it's tragic it's not okay look it's not
like he's like ugly he's uglier then he
was like I sound bad but I don't know if
you guys remember original like og com
look at this guy look at him in his
heyday puppy Kong off fluffy and all
cute like he used to be a little
puffball
he was so puffy it's like if I had a
hundred of him and strike them down I
could literally I could start a cereal
brand maybe called mini cons and they be
looking amazing and I would put
Kellogg's out of business fact but I
digress
Kong his hair now has gotten long and it
flows down his back like lays down it's
not puffy and he write it just like I
mean it's no Blaine so Brennan what did
you say today no I would think that by
giving a haircut it wouldn't make them
fluffy I think it'll help just puff him
back up I don't know the actual science
of dog hair growth okay I'm not a
scientist I'm not God I'm pretty
freaking close but I'm not just a vlog
I'm such a judge you know also if you're
not subscribed and I guarantee no one
has ever come to the doctor's office
looking this swag no Venice Beach and
jump into the canal here oh yeah those
are gross - I told her about jumping
into the water and Italy this Italian
water just posted in my brain so what is
this hurt it's blood pressure how can it
hurt actually I
yeah I think I've done this off the
problem is I'm yoked you know naturally
so this like squeezing my biceps like
can be honest ask me question yeah
do you think I'm dying no I don't think
you're dying and thank God okay so
doctor came in he's Brenda Liddy you
guys best back what he did tell me
what's wrong with me you guys ready for
this is your boy is dying I'm dying he
said yeah so look impove long signing
off forever infection dude he described
it as he described it as a cold that
doesn't go away so he prescribed me with
drugs it now yeah it means drug this
means drowned have a healthy drugs so
we're gonna go get those later and
hopefully you know I'll feel up soon but
yo oh oh
what that's definitely not okay okay I'm
a little bored we wanted to come pick up
Judy you guys know Judy she's the
Spanish girl who cusses a lot and calls
me stupid a lot so we're gonna go pick
her up literally just to honk the train
horn in her face which actually brings
up a funny point my brother Jake is not
so funny actually it's getting sued for
this exact thing the issue is he did it
to a stranger not someone he knows so I
guess technically yes Judy could sue me
but Judy
Julie Julie Julie I do
come up here Judy your neighbors are
gonna hate you why do they hate you Judy
I'll send all your neighbors flower gift
baskets lydia flower gift baskets for
all Judy's neighbors step no Brendon
just pointed something out to me if this
is what I think it is what is that Oh
some sort of like final destination if I
don't take care of him why is he so
awesome and healthy and perfect because
Lydia you hold him and you just put his
leashes through doors for final
destination yeah
I can still park right over them
bubbles dog grooming doesn't sound legit
barking at that fake dog that's a fake
dog it's fake you're good you're good
bro - you're confusing me Kong he's like
yo you're lucky you're not real
otherwise I would beat that ass these
are different types of dogs oh I think
mmm those herself oh yeah I want the
bitch in style heel Brendan like
honestly what should we do guys we could
leave his fluffy lion mane and just trim
down his body
what if we did the opposite and just
shaved his face and then leave his body
funky yeah we could do stripes like
donuts around his body I grow stripes
yeah I like how Kong can be so hype and
sometimes just so chill like what are
you thinking right now bro oh okay he's
a high profile dog very famous on
Instagram he needs to look he needs to
look savage you know because his name is
Kong savage and so I want to I want to
