oh I didn't say this guy's but we raised
it to inches and fat in the wheel as if
it's not already hard enough to get out
here ready for 50 points are ladies and
gentlemen I love the low gang I refuse
to run the movie I'm not
know what though so many things going
through my mind right now what off just
happened one I always say this after I I
meet you guys in person literally too
strong you showing from my own good I
got you what you are out of my control
either with it
train horn impossible second off the
Yeti is an absolute full beast mode
right now like guys we didn't even show
everything that we had upgraded and
we're gonna drive a little bit cool down
let the chaos just disperse itself turn
left onto North Fairfax Avenue okay
sounds good with the sub series got bass
and then we'll get into the montage
stuff and wait till I show you guys
what's on top - yeah okay a little
update not so good we are driving to
Malibu right now then Brendan I think
you're gonna find this kind of funny
it's not funny it actually kind of sucks
I just got a text from face banks can
you read this aloud why would you get
our pop-up shut down purposefully like
what'd you hit by a car cuz what you did
right
there was a car accident yo feel like
that's not your fault dude like zero
this I've been planning this day picking
up the Yeti for at least two weeks now I
had no idea like I did we showed up and
my business manager was like hey by the
way there's a pop-up shop across the
street clearly had no idea that type of
chaos was going to ensue I don't even
know if our fans overlap hardly right so
okay - I
I just been finding out about now the
car accident and he's saying someone got
hit by a car
if that is true my sincerest apologies
guys obviously that was never my
intention I hate hearing about like
people getting hurt like negative stuff
like this going down when like to me
it's just like it's all positivity it's
all fun I show up and get this my dream
car back and like I said banks and I
scream I apologize earlier in the vlog
before I even got this text I said I'm
sorry and I'm sorry to hear about what
happened but we try to maintain control
in the situations I brought them out and
then managed to close the gate it's just
so hard because there's so many people
and not enough of me or Brendan's to
like push everyone back freaking Lydia's
getting trampled herself like
but the point is I hope now everyone is
safe and hope everything's okay what
that said let's get back to the fun
stuff not back to the fun stuff just yet
yeah dude what are you doing driving the
Malibu what are you doing no but I mean
what did you just do do you know I saw
your text some kid guy someone got hit
by a car something wants to update me
what's happening is it how bad is it
because when you say that it sounds like
the homies in the know I mean the cops
came the authorities not him I'm sorry
you guys got a shot at the shut down
Melrose do you know if that person is
okay I have no idea what were you doing
so I I had my g-wagen upgraded it's been
in the shop for the past month now and
today was the day I went to go pick it
up unfortunately you guys had your
pop-up shop right across the street and
to be honest bro it's just a super weird
coincidence that you happen to be right
across the street from the spot I've
been I wanted to pick up the Yeti from
before I arrived on my vlog I was like
yo this this is gonna get attacked the
guy I was completely unaware of this
hopefully doesn't go down and then now
unfortunately just went down and I
understand you live and you learn
whatever it's all good about really to
what concern about that I just the whole
like think that it's time to give you a
heads up of that no dude thank I hope
whoever got hit is is fine that sucks
all right for sure all right I'll let
you know if I get up get it on hi
Oh
chaotic weird fun crazy day here in the
beautiful Malibu right now oh not in
Italy anymore but bellissimo media
chatter morning okay so I'm gonna show
you and know it's loud but I'm gonna
show you some of the other stuff we've
done to the Yeti before we get into like
our cool montage because there's a
little surprise like I said I check the
stop use used to be or just blacked him
out yet all this stuff used to be silver
and chrome blacked him out
yeah look it's actually also these legs
like I said didn't work originally well
now they kind of work we gotta get those
other two light bulbs all right blacked
out all of the silver along the car here
car Getty Rock Monster I don't think
this is never gonna get all you open the
door and the step comes down oh yeah the
names in the back of the car I know I
said this earlier but these guys are
forever a part of my life and all of you
are to be honest these guys are the
lucky ones who won the contest still
have to pick two of you guys that I'm
gonna play out here to take a ride in
the Yeti again if you participated in
that contest thank you we will have
another one soon I want to show you guys
the basic and just just show you here

vibrating and there's gonna be like

them put a louder exhaust on so check
this out right now the exhaust is off
listen
Wow but it can be better when we're not
filming inside the car and we wanna we
want to sound like men again the nice
thing about that is you can turn it on
and off whatever you want and then
there's a little extra surprise up top
which I think we will show you in the
montage starting
