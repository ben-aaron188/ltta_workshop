okay story time
good morning Paul Brothers in Italy I
don't know how we didn't get kicked out
yet okay we're still here dog oh okay
here's the background I'm gonna make
this short Jake asshole Lamborghini
prank on my birthday
I'm not kidding literally went from the
best day of my life to the absolute
worst asshole and then being the frickin
local young man I am I said this is only
one way I can come back to this if I see
pull into Lots today and buy an actual
tempo boom I was like yo dude I'm buying
a Lambo today found out you couldn't do
that because they're very expensive cars
it's kind of a big deal Jake was like yo
if you're doing it I'm doing it too and
then it was his idea to customize 2018
Lamborghini Huracan perform on taste I
went to the Lamborghini dealership I had
you guys actually choose the color and
help me customize it Logan y'all got my
back and they told us what about coming
to Italy they were like yo you're gonna
come to Italy you're gonna wait like six
months it's gonna be amazing
they're gonna do a tour of the factory
base whole nine yards pick up your own
Lamborghini that you customize I was
like y'all some dope and then I know the
timeframe and I got using my brain which
I'm not good at and I was like pulled up
pause I'm about to drop three hundred
fifty thousand dollars on a car I just
bought the Yeti
and like I'm not a huge car guy right I
like cars I don't love cars like he does
my love is a genuine concern like it's a
very dangerous car and me behind the
wheel so like dog I don't know I decided
not to get it and then I had to tell
brother Jake and then I cried like a
bitch I am NOT getting a Lamborghini
with you and then we get here the other
day because originally I just flew here
to surprise him and support him while he
gets his Lambo so now that y'all have
been blessed with some information I
think you should know I'm running late
again London get in the boat I'm getting
here and getting the boat come on guys
my brother needs a Lamborghini
my phone or train left one minute ago
nice she's so % I got to be honest I
wasn't even sure if I'm still able to
get the Lambo because I can't so like I
put my $25,000 deposit down told them
like I wasn't getting so they don't know
I'm even here no boys gone
I gotta be honest I've never like
actually missed a flight or a train I've
always like made them by the hair of my
skin it's just kind of sad anyway
holding my business manager Andrew I
asked him last night in the middle of
the streets of Italy if it was even
possible for me to get the car this was
last night last night this is
hypothetical if I go to the factory
tomorrow and I see this and I and I want
to buy it
because I put down the twenty five
thousand do they still have it could I
still do that is it that is that even an
option like my exact Lambert the one
that I customized is at the factory like
I'm gonna see you tomorrow well this
could go down future Logan take it away
though I feel like while we wait for our
next train and hopefully don't miss that
one it's a good time to say he's gonna
be one of the most real vlogs probably
ever like Rob brendan admit there's some
real life this is real life only once in
my lifetime am I gonna be presented with
this opportunity to buy a supercar with
my brother all gonna be a split decision
like if I get there and I see it now
knowing that my business manager oh stop
I'm blogging shut up John anyways Andrew
said my car is still there built and
ready to go so if I see this thing and
I'm like I mean like who knows bro I
don't even know the actions I'm gonna
take until I take that look at this bro
look at the bird bro I'm the Maverick
and I I don't want to miss the train
I just keep happening oh it's a miracle
to me papa vlogging with the food
well I was not gonna get this car
I like kid is so persuasive what I saw
please bless the low gang with some
facts as you bless me about this this
big the Lamborghini Otacon photo from
Monday fastest Lamborghini ever made
fastest car to lap the Nurburgring fact
Nurburgring is like the most respected
track in the world fact this is also one
of the first like mass-produced
Lamborghinis with like the exhaust
coming straight out the back like this
you don't know them oh god no honey now
hey but stuff I can't say the same zero
to 60 in less than 2.5 seconds you know
I've asked you for five is go oh no I
don't think is that fast oh look the
point is the litmus level is freakin
maximum and I love doing stuff with my
little bro even if it is buying a
supercar well you know our lives are you
know I'm not I mean as of now literally
bro I have no idea with that said let's
head to the Lamborghini Factory in my
den and he's at what our grabber grabber
teacher
Madana

watch his vlogs they're good you'd be
happy Thanks okay hold on come back slow
shop
I guess that merciful be a maverick yo
yo alright car number two here we're
going to this place Lamborghini moves
yeah
completely like the middle of nowhere in
Italy is going down that's multicultural
my colleagues because you should leave
all your cameras here so slight issue
right now and I think this is part of
the reason I was like on the fence about
getting a Lambo hearing those words I
know filming bro just might as well just
stab me in the chest
so I can't film it so you're having a
little powwow I'm hoping they let us
film bro cuz that would destroy the
point literally like the reason we're
getting Lamborghinis is because of you
guys the viewers the low gang - Jake
Palmer and if we can't film what like
what doesn't make any in the sense of
the so Jake is talking to like the boss
people this is hilarious I'm having so
much fun now cuz like I'm just I'm here
for the ride today but apparently not in
the actual Lamborghini weird what just
went down bro I don't even know it like
I can't summarize it like that it's it's
laughable it's disrespectful childish
it's basically the end of the
conversation was
I have a card if you want me to give you
my card he was like he got up got up
walked out I mean I don't even know what
to do
I thought you Oh cuz like I'm not really
involved but kinda oh you see oh my god
it is possible look he's doing it got
some sketchy rules bro we film we can we
not I don't know what we can't film
inside folks will know can we show
inside no field no film okay for sure
obviously I'm gonna film everything
we're vloggers why would we not film
everything
Jake is deciding if we want to do the
factory visit that's the security guards
hand that's gonna stop do not feel bad
put the cameras down here comes the hand
that describes how I'm feeling right now
I'm feeling such Tim I'm feeling such a
weird rush of emotions I just got hit by
a car it just give us a tour of the
factory and I saw the car that I was
gonna get what's careful literally it
was right next to Jake's Lambo he's over
there doing his vlog of disappointment
yo Jake the scream I'm disappointed damn
it was just like the worst torture like
for me i okay yes the car was cool but
like I said I'm indifferent I'm on the
fence I will say they gave me a nice
gift bag kind of like a Lamborghini I'm
sorry I'm being a chach here is who I
feel the worst for not not not the
driver not the vehicle just
Jake Paul he wants nothing more in the
world than to get this vehicle he's been
waiting six months and like I said I had
not planned on getting a car I planned a
different vlog so maybe I can make his
day I did bring a little joke by the way
this is what the vlog was gonna be I was
gonna say like I like I bought a
Lamborghini or just me this Isle Jake
gets his actual Lamborghini but it looks
like I'm just giving this to Jake hi
feeling yeah I got something I'll make
you feel a little better this is the
dumbass notebook that they gave us I
mean the gift it's not the dumbass
notebook it is a brand new Lamborghini
oh he's he's straight-up silenced I I'm
gonna let you imma let you do your thing
I told you today was gonna be a very
real look and that it was daddy was if
his pride his ego is so big and he feels
like he's been in - - - but he feels
like he's been insulted I actually need
you do I go bitch they get a Ferrari
listen this and get a Porsche hey
Bugatti mister Bugatti I want a Bugatti
Chiron right now what do i do Logan hey

I'm a
yo we drove five minutes down the road

straight up the exactly the same car
that we ordered we're in the middle of
nowhere the kid the kid this kids dying
right now this is horrible I feel so bad
for him always dying devastated like
this super-sick can I just kinda sighs I
mean it's a safe can call our car that I
ordered things the most expensive Kali
it's like

hours or so to just cool down relax
we're at the super cool Villa right now
look around bro Italy you've done it
again I'm gonna show you guys more of
this tomorrow with the house tour go
down there and the vineyard drone shot
sexy stuff but for now I just okay here
are my closing thoughts on the situation
for me the whole possibility of getting
the Lamborghini like if I was gonna do
it it was all about the experience
unfortunately today as you guys know our
experience was not so bueno so long
story short I just I was very turned off
by it like you guys don't understand
when we went in the factory we did the
tour like I'm not even getting out of
all the cars they're making my fucking
Lamborghini my customized Lamborghini
matte orange beautiful is sitting right
next to Jake's finish car like how are
the two Paul Brothers vehicles just
sitting next like how like knew they
knew we were coming and they put like
stickers over our iPhones and like I'm
gonna be honest with you looking I had a
plan I always have a plan I was not not
a joke not lying I was going to flip a
coin I have it here here we go a euro a
European coin I was gonna literally flip
a coin if it landed on tails I was going
to spend four hundred thousand dollars
to buy this Lamborghini in the moment
one shot 50-50 chance that was the plan
because y'all I'm a maverick like I
wrapped a logo every day it's what I do
and that's where I get like my like
that's where I get my excitement from
that's like why I live like what can I
do right now in the moment how can I be
present so I can I can milk life and
live life to its fullest potential what
I didn't even get an opportunity to flip
the coin so like for that reason I'm out
it's a real with that said slow Gary
