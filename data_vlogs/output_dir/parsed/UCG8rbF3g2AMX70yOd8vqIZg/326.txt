not sure how to finish his blog but
savages always have a solution which is
why I am outside of my brother's house

like this idea
you work for Jake but lately what's the
situation
lately and honestly so why tell me why

with all the boys like you and too much
not being very appreciated not not being
appreciated like the young intelligent
respectful woman that you are here's a
mom and your daughter okay exactly I
know that no and over here in average
media we respect women we appreciate
them so here's the plan
when Jake comes home you got to tell
them that I left okay but you Eric you
tell Jake that you changed your mind and
you're coming to work for me okay and
I'll just be like I'll be hiding in like
a cupboard or something is this gonna be
believable like because you've been like
