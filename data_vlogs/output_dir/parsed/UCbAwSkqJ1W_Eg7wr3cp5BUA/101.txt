I got a shake weight for Christmas I
wonder what went hello friends and
welcome to another video today I'm going
to be trying out another strange dupe
that nobody really asked me to try a few
months ago a makeup company called
hourglass came out with the stainless
steel mascara wand I think the idea
behind a stainless steel mascara wand is
that there's no bristles so you can't
really get clumps on it so this is the
hourglass curator lash instrument excuse
me for calling it a mascara wand it
looks like a very discreet adult toy of
some kind and then at the end there are
these little divots and after this thing
came out I saw a few youtubers do videos
about it and a lot of the comments were
rightfully upset at the price of it the
mascara wand is $78 and the lash primer
and mascara that they sell to go
specifically with that mascara wand are
$36 each I also saw a decent amount of
comments who suggested using a screw
instead of this mascara wand so what did
I do you guys I went to Home Depot and I
bought a couple screws I never thought
that I would be heading to Home Depot to
find a mascara wand but that's what
we're doing today I mean it's bigger
than Sephora no question so let's see if
we can find one that's nice similar like
these ones are kind of wide because of
course they are actual screws it's not
perfect ours yes I was honestly very
intrigued by the product to begin with I
was even more intrigued when the idea of
using a screw came up because it kind of
seems like it would work whoa this is
like pretty good almost like this kind
of similar thickness not quite as
tightly coiled but pretty close machine
screws number eight 32 by one and a half
for number six 32 by one and a half got
my mascara wands I'm gonna have to
figure out how to clean these thing and
some excited do you this is the first
makeup haul ever out of Home Depot now I
just want to say that I'm not
necessarily recommending you do this at
home I am taking on the risk personally
to put a screw near my eyeball I don't
want you to do this and poke your eye
out I'm going to do left eye screw right
eye mascara wand let's do this thing
start off with the lash instrument it
seems like the lash instrument if the
one bringing this metal mascara wand
thing to the tables I got my lash primer
I have my mascara wand oh my god looks
like a like a little hat so you can
screw the lash instrument right into the
primer and I suppose the mascara as well
kind of turning it into this like very
pointy dangerous normal mascara to mix
it around I guess it looks like lotion
on the mascara wand I'm just gonna put
this primer on my lashes it doesn't
really look like much as going on it
looks oh I can see like a little bit of
gray or white flecks at the end of my
lashes looks like dandruff why does this
always happen to me
alright so I'm just gonna go in with the
same stuff and put it on my bottom
lashes it's a little bit disconcerting
to put this thin stainless-steel thing
like right next to your eye so I'm
excited to get to that screw here's the
lash primer trying to shake it around
shimmy it around
should I get some primer on there you
know Oh yep jackpot once again it looks
a lot like lotion the one thing about
this screw is that the divots are not
quite as close together as on the
curator lash instrument but it's pretty
close I was completely silent there
because I was so nervous I think it is
actually applying it reasonably well
obviously with the lash instrument you
have that fun weapon effect with this
you kind of just got like a shake weight
effect oh my god oh my god I almost
touch my eye oh my god wait be careful
with those things guys be careful okay
awesome this is my screw eye and this is
my curator eye it's not exactly the same
but it's getting the general idea down
this screw it's not winning but it's not
losing yet let's tackle the mascara now
back to the lash instrument I do
absolutely love the look of this thing
when it's all screwed together it's like
what's happened there we go the end is
covered in mascara
hmm
uh.okay
I've never used lash primer before and I
wonder if I did something wrong it just
it looks very spidery it looks like
Charlotte is you know trying to help me
out she's trying to write a message in
the lash bottom lashes are not about the
bottom lashes are pretty normal okay I'm
gonna show you guys up close don't you
think it looks kind of spidery it's like
a black widow baby the bottom line
should look pretty nice just this end at
the top lashes it's kind of like going
everywhere I'm putting the curator back
in its holster and I'm going in with the
screw the lash instrument has a long
handle and this has no handle so I am
about to get mascara all over my hands
in fact it's already happened it's
pretty well coated
so no hmm mm hmm I'm gonna go in for the
bottom lashes I don't know about this
you guys I kind of expected the
stainless steel to really separate all
the lashes like almost just to give it
everything like a thin coating but it's
kind of clumpy er than I expected this
is the lash instrument side and this is
the screw side actually looking at it up
close it's not that bad but it's just
it's not really what I expected in terms
of comparing the screw to the lash
instrument I think this screw did pretty
well
if the lash instrument is definitely a
little bit better at separating but it's
not that much better actually looking at
it for a little while I'm definitely
impressed by the lengths to which my
lashes have been brought they're very
long right now they would definitely hit
up against my glasses if I were wearing
my glasses just because I am a little
bit of a stickler about the whole clumpy
last thing I'm gonna take this off and
just put the mascara on and we're gonna
see if it looks any better ten minutes
later I returned this stuff is does not
come out very easily but I think I got
it off okay I think I already liked the
look of it without the primer better
let's just do this screw really quick
where's my screw who screw and
hocus-pocus she goes boom boom there it
is so this is the effect without the
lash primer I actually like it better I
think it looks a little bit less spidery
I think the screw is a little clumpy err
the curators a little finer but for a
decent the curator is a bit finer with
it
divits so it can separate the lashes a
little better I didn't think that it was
that much finer but you can kind of tell
the difference though to be fair a pack
of these two screws is a dollar eighteen
and the curator lash instrument is
seventy eight dollars so I think with
that price difference I would say that
the screw did pretty damn well
this screw never asked to be a mascara
wand but she served me well today in
terms of generally using a metal mascara
wand I think the effect is pretty I
think it's decent I don't think I like
this more than my normal better than sex
little mini mascara that I use I think
I'm probably going to stick with that
but it's not that bad and the screw did
pretty well
is this a dupe or a bad idea I think
that this is both a pretty good dupe and
also probably a bad idea you know is it
a bad idea doesn't mean it didn't work I
think it's just like sure you put a
screw near your eye I don't know it just
seems like it could end badly I hope you
