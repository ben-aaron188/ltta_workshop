hello friends and welcome to another
video this week we're going to be trying
meet up with shoes in the world now a
couple of months ago I saw
advertisements online for the upcoming
collab between hugs and Tevas I'm not
sure it ugh and TiVo literally called at
the ugliest you in the world but a lot
of articles were naming at the ugliest
shoe in the world and I decided why not
order the ugliest shoe in the world and
wear it around for a week and see
honestly if it's as bad as people think
it is I'm a curious to see if we can
find a use for them Tevas are good for
the outdoors when it's warm
herbs are good for the indoors and the
California winter so like maybe together
it can be something I think we should
get to unboxing I got this shoe let me
see bands a name it's just called a TiVo
collab hybrid okay there are a few
styles and I honestly ordered the one
that I like the best
maybe I should have ordered the one that
I like the least but I wanted to
actually give these things a fair try
okay so here is the left shoe so inside
the upper part is this kind of shearling
fabric like bug has the size and me toes
are completely exposed
that's the Teva aspect I chose the white
and black option I thought it was the
secant and it's like I don't really know
if my ankles will be really warm but my
toes will be freezing it is kind of like
an outdoor flipper you know I know that
I feel like we should put these on
yeah Justin you guys know I you know
crooked toes but I did shave my large
toes with it okay well please give it a
title to it
oh well this is a sham well you cannot
tighten this you look oh wow
you cannot tighten the toe strap you can
tighten this middle trout though that's
work all of the tightening comes from
they feel pretty comfortable I can feel
the shearling on the top of my foot it's
a nice feeling I know
that there's not as many fastenings as
with usual Tevas where you can really
tighten it to your foot okay so it's a
little bit loose up top I do see a
little bit of arch support not a lot but
a little bit it's kind of like the lap
so laughs so laughs you know pretty loud
hello
so day one I tried to style my ugliest
shoes in the world kind of like how I
would style boots in general kind of
it's more like a crop top a flowy skirt
and now I'd like mint just put some
boots on there that those boots are
usually fine the feel is mostly ugh I
feel the warmth in it and then it's just
suppose they're exposed where it's like
oh damn you keifa damn you but like I
don't want to be wearing socks because
then you'll be able to see to stop I
shows them you guys on next week and you
guys are pretty nice I think the
harshest comment but also a true comment
was that they looks like ankle braces I
think that was a common misconception
from many people both on the internet
and in real life that I had broken both
my ankles I got a kind of Captain Morgan
pants bottle captain inside of me I
don't feel embarrassed but I definitely
am conscious of them I think this shirt
though works with it full-time weirdo
halftime diva and ugh lumber so today's
the second day of me trying to wear the
ugliest over the world day - I didn't
really have time to like style them per
se I was editing most of the day and
then I really only like left the house
to get food and coffee so I kind of just
threw these on with leggings and a
flannel and a jacket because it was cold
in some ways that outfit works the best
into the kind of was like oh she ran out
of the house
those are her house slippers like
whatever I want a pair Tyler you know
that you and I are the same size
basically I didn't eventually Arum we
can use this pair my only thing today is
that I'm so comfortable everywhere got
comes like
couple flail humble sleep but my toes
are just so out in the world if you
basically have it I do
I actually do kind of feel a little bit
like a hobbit like a futuristic comment
so we're about to go get some ramen I'm
wearing like this little corset thingy
this dress I think these kind of have
some weird style to them I agree they
look like cast like that's established
there's almost a Tom Haverford from
Parks and Rec live to them maybe more of
a John Ralphie oh but something like it
would be an entertainment 720 like they
are so weird that they're cool I don't
think that they make a lot of sense
practically but I think that if a
trendsetter wore them one might be like
ah
a trend I feel like days 1 2 3 I was
getting used to them stay for I was like
I got this they're going to be chunky
shoes I'm going to wear a short dress
but a jacket and it's kind of going to
be like a thing you know it's going to
be like a trendy look trendy went to a
coffee shop met Stevie I've met someone
who likes my shoes what did you like
about my feelings I like today we're so
different
I'll never see those duplicated most
people today I felt with people were
being overly harsh categorizing these
ëthey ugliest shoes in the world so
hearing like a third party approval made
me feel pretty good I was like oh I'm
not just living in my own bubble
Stevie liken to so Stevie wherever you
are I appreciate you now this day ran
hot and cold because I also Instagram
this day I was inviting the roasts
especially by not pointing out the shoes
explicitly I was thinking about cleaning
out the shoes in the caption but instead
I decided to be a little sneakier and
just like Instagram the picture without
mentioning the shoes I don't think that
you guys like my shoes very much anyone
who probably has hated my shoes on the
street doesn't only want to come up to
me and tell me that they hate my shoes
but you know you guys on Instagram are
more honest unabashed you know came
forward with your opinions and I
appreciate them because it's useful for
this investigation a lot of people like
them like a lot of people thought they
were really interesting or they reminds
them of Naruto or they seemed like fun
winter sandals and a lot of people are
like I can't support this decision like
don't do this stop constructive critic
here the shoes are not a good choice
what are those not a mean actually what
are
I threw up a little when I saw those
shoes I liked this picture then notice
the shoes and immediately unliked it
destroy these shoes then destroy the
room you destroy the shoes take that
rubble and jettison it into space rest
of the outfit of night I know everyone
else has already said it and me adding
my comments is overkill but what the
hell kind of shoes are you wearing and
more importantly why for shoes that are
supposed to be the ugliest shoes in the
world the reaction was negative but it
wasn't as negative as it could have been
day 5 of wearing these shoes I couldn't
have gotten to the point with these
shoes where I'm just wearing them like
on ironically I'm just like dad these
are just the shoes I'm wearing today
when it was colder out I was way more
conscious of them so I was like oh my
ankles are warm but my toes are freezing
cool but now that it's warm out I'm just
kind of like I've got a soft wrap around
my ankle and I actually don't think that
too many people take too much notice
because if they think it's weird they
probably just think that my ankles are
broken okay guys basics of wearing the
ugliest shoes in the world
I'm here with Natalie's outlet Natalie
what do you think of my shoes I actually
don't think they're as bad that I said
they're like girls off gladiator kind of
sandal yeah and um I just say I don't
know it looked awful thank you I really
appreciated that no I think that you
know I'm really not lying the day six I
decided to take my shoes out for a
nighttime spin took them out on a date
with Tyler to get some ice cream
Tyler how do you think my shoes are
being received
you can tell well well I think that
everyone is jealous about how
comfortable in your shoes look or at
least everybody being me I mean Tyler
wear them and of course he looks better
in them than I do which is happy to find
it's what I wanted it's fine I really
like them I mean I feel like honestly
these are the perfect shoes to like sit
back and like playing video games and
like stumbling down a Dunkin Donuts
still like minimal interaction of other
people yes
velocity is a weak rolled around going
out to you with my shoes at the very end
of this week
weirdly sentimental because I used to
have a reason to be wearing them I'm
wearing them for a video you know and
now it's like well if I want to wear
them I gotta wear ironic ly with no
reason they're really comfortable they
love my toes be out in the world about
the equation I have developed a fondness
for these shoes I feel like they're
rejected by a lot of people and I was
just like I want to care for you you
know you like you weirdly they show off
my pedicure while keeping my ankles warm
in case I ever pull a Martha Stewart and
do some insider trading they could cover
up the ankle bracelet I still think that
these are the ugliest shoes in the world
I don't think they are fashionable in a
conventional sense I think that they are
interesting comfortable Corky lovable
futuristic hobbit like kind of know
something about them they're like so
weird I love them you guys can let me
