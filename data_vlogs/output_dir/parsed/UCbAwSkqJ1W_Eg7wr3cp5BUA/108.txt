hello friends and welcome to another
video today we are going to be doing
something very fun and also
nerve-wracking Michelle and I are going
to be doing henna on each other for the
very first time this is Michelle
hi and we have a lovely expert layout
here hi I have been doing henna for 23
years and the last few years have been
truly incredible I've been able to kind
of do henna outside of the box but to do
it on other parts of the body and kind
of think outside the box and get
creative that's like my favorite
favorite thing to do and she's going to
be trying to keep us from ruining each
other you know if we could not end up
just like completely dyed red that way
you know who I have never done henna on
myself so this will be interesting doing
it hon I'm not very good at handwriting
me neither I was very bad I was very
relieved to realize that you don't
really need cursive in your like adult
life I don't know if you guys remember
that feel like at the end like the a CT
test
I don't you guys ever took that you have
to like write like I didn't cheat on
this exam in cursive David how do I
write in cursive now like ten years
after I learned how to do it so that's
the level you're working with yes well
we I think I think everyone's gonna be
just fine I just want to get one flower
that would be cool okay that wall is to
get one flower what's your goal I love
what the Paisley's Olympian those are my
favorites so I can do immediately and a
flower I think you very not and I also
think we can incorporate some detail and
I think you can able to present help on
how much detail we can get in
how far did we need a couple things
definitely some paper towels because it
does get messy of course the henna cone
these little handy dandy things your
tubes but they're basically like pastry
guys when I'm up here scissors the most
critical thing is how big you cut the
tip I just want to get it to the right
thickness to where you get even pressure
and a nice straight line
kind of a little bit more yeah I don't
think anybody coming out it's going to
call out with E yeah there we go
god I love this hello Hannah so right
hand like a pencil right hand like a
pencil on an animai pan you're gonna
squeeze up top this is already I can't
even get it out I think you're chilling
okay just me Oh who's gonna go first
I'll go for any concern if I mess up
really bad we can wipe it off in the
start from the beginning like any look I
did this little motif on my hand oh and
it's already stained it's just it's
nerve-wracking to begin on someone
else's body
let me show your hand so little I don't
know what to do I have very spindly long
fingers but you have a lot of negative
sorry
oh we all did keep in mind this isn't
the video where we get into each other
real tattoos so you mentioned that you
want to learn how to do the painting yes
it's a very popular design when it comes
to henna so it's kind of like an S shape
I don't know what that was so you also
have to pay attention to the orientation
of the hand it was fun fun I think you
should try to henna hung him around the
feed I love it you called him head off
growing up I would visit India often and
I would get henna done all the time and
though tena humps were like so staple
and it's a good filler when it makes it
look like filigree and lace so many
humps so little time when you have a
shape like that that you want to fill
yeah maybe you just consider putting
another teardrop in there and see what
happens sense well I'm going to turn my
hand oh me me yeah the last time I got
like really intense henna that was like
black I was like in an Indian wedding my
grandma put my hands in like cloth bags
and ha and I slept like this and it was
so itchy and uncomfortable and then
maybe I'll just like shade in the inside
and like that well it's good because
it's what's happening here this is not a
smile it always looks like a Monsters
Inc guy I got cheese all over your face
so the next things will be a little more
like a week
and a little less like a little old
monster man whoa okay I feel pretty
decent about that
show me how bit now where are you Genie
from here I do not know maybe just maybe
see like a mine just like one finger
yeah one yeah oh yeah it's so small it's
a small bean no all right
whoo I think that my humps believe a
little precision to be desired but I
feel like after a couple of minutes you
really do get the hang of using it like
when do you start going I was like I'm
not even where he drives a lot of places
very aggressively and then just throw
them the birds do some quick warm-up
line I apologize in advance but
thankfully this is not a real hatchet I
think I just want to go for the Miss
dead center
that's energy that's a flattest plane
yes you can do like the mandala type
flowers they start with the circle what
I like to do is any design that I make I
like to frame it even the dot I like to
frame I can look at that I can do
circles I'm very close got it touchdown
myself do this yes okay how much time
there your helps Michelle own the house
and my hump my hump my lovely ladies I
remember every but I honestly think
Michelle this is gonna turn out really
cool you put so much faith in me anyways
I think it'll be great
all right now what do I do do you feel
ambitious to add a little more detail so
we're going to make these little trees
basically you start by making the dots
and you drag your tube down meaning
you're on another dot and drag your palm
down and you make another dot you drag
your tooth down it just me so see yes
they made eights the hard edges off you
guys might be getting a good view of my
Benihana's car I burned my hand at
Benihana
oh that video yeah and it didn't it
didn't make it into the final cut
it's like Tori Spelling yeah just great
and you covered way more surface area
than I did I really liked it yeah right
but yeah things I am definitely see
carefully I love
yeah thank you so much for being here oh
my god putz it surely that's what helped
me I can't help you it's an easy fix

one keep going up this is what I do an
eyeliner to do all right back in
business can you like honestly a really
good thing that we were just going to
say I'm very impressed and you were such
a good teacher oh my lady yeah honestly
I feel like 90% is a success it's from
your teaching I think anyone can do it I
really you have to like channel your
inner artist and just go with it you're
looking at other senses and now I just
wanna look through it yeah and I'm gonna
show them Michelle's house like hey what
are you doing
so Michelle pen I came out so awesome
look at that the design looks really
good and you can barely even tell where
I smudged at the end so I took off the
henna this morning and I really really
love how it turned out yeah I love the
detail and how dark it is I think the
color is pretty good too though I did
not leave it on overnight as it gets
very crusty and you guys know that I
