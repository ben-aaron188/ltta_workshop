to be fair vagisil makes no claims about
being a primary this is not a critique
of vagisil and the great work that it
does for the downstairs gym hello
friends and welcome to another video
today we're bringing you some
hard-hitting journalism some
investigation some myth-busting hmm we
saw a video about who - beauty she put
like KY jelly milk of magnesia and
badges hilt on her face as made a primer
she did not recommend I don't know if
they recommend because she did say maybe
don't do this at the end but she did say
that vagisil works the best out of the
things that she tried today we're going
to be trying to see if vagisil work
similarly to an actual primer just in
case you know say you just wanted to use
magical as primer for like a while maybe
it could and it's actually a sample from
Sephora this is the makeup forever step
one skin equalizer smoothing primer by
the way you guys have probably noticed
already but Freddie here today everyone
say hello to Freddy Freddy has
graciously agreed to put veggies along
her face for me
vagisil and I have a relationship I
won't say that we linked up many times a
year but back to when I linked up maybe
twice two hundred years depending on the
status of I've never used vagisil I feel
like I've used like summer's eve wiped
you know and okay so the smell of that
just know is just something that brings
back like awful memories of just a very
very routine uncomfortable vagina so I'm
hoping that like using a sense primer
and then putting on the other products
that we typically use like our amazing
concealer will conceal the smell do you
have an itchy face I don't have an itchy
face currently I was going to say like
Navis would help okay let's get into it
let's just do it we're going to do one
half of our face of vagisil and the
other half of our face into make up
forever primer and then we're going to
put our foundation on and see how things
go from there although I couldn't really
tell which kind of vagisil that she was
using in that video I went for the itch
relief formula maximum strength so let's
do left side that vagisil right side
makeup
forever nothing look at that looks like
nice primer that was fun
it looks like a tiny and adorable turn I
don't miss these badges all but oh my
god I gotta get in wait play the foil
prick you just love putting things in
your mouth it smells just like medicated
to me yeah it's really not that bad I
think just the smell of that but my
should remind business it was like a
combo it's been a sale into two when it
said its release formula I thought it
was going to be like stickier but it's
actually quite smooth though it does
feel like there are little granules
inside of it I wonder if this is because
I got the extra strength or if it's just
always like that I love this makeup
primer crime okay no I'm starting to
smell something mm-hmm that's this mess
it's no kind of like diaper rash cream
or something I just sort of putting this
on my face and it's like peeling off my
face did I do something wrong
we need healing off can you guys see
this there's like little residue all
over the left side of my face I'm just
going to keep trying to like blend it in
maybe she likes dry I'm trying so hard
not to get any of this vegetal in any
bit of my baby hair I'm just confused
because maybe the extra strength was the
problem I don't know though I feel like
I'd use both so that I'm pretty similar
that's an inconsistency so it is
actually kind of blending into my face a
little bit more as it dries but I think
something about the extra-strength itch
relief is kind of slightly numbing my
face oh my face is tingling right yeah
click it feels yeah tingling it feels
minty fresh that it looks like clumping
together that's the radical side and
let's do the primer side oh my god my
top lip is becoming numb
not completely numb but like warm and
yeah yeah if you're blending it at all
no I didn't eat besides these clumps
though is kind of it is kind of melting
in a little bit next step foundation oh
my face is feeling crazy I mean if
anything you know that the vaginal is
not trying to like hurt you what
stay on the bag for external use only
when contacted eyes do not apply to over
large areas of the body face is a pretty
small area whatever maybe she was using
a different kind of magical but I looked
like in the description to see if she
like wrote like which exact one she got
and it wasn't there and that's like
where I get 85% of my information right
side of the bag make up forevers Prime
and everything's happening beautifully
coming together very smoothly and
settings
you can't forget which side is which
because the left half of my face is
slightly though yeah is that's what it
does it just like numb you Lahaina so
you can't feel the itch anymore yet by
no means is this a critique of gyda so
on how it works it is meant to be used
on your vagina yeah who's slightly
nummis but when you put it on your face
it might make your face enough okay
should I go ahead and start on the other
side and nervous I'm nervous too I will
pay this to make up forever primer seem
very nice
yeah and great it could I have no qualms
at all oh my god looks like stage makeup
and I'm supposed to be like a villain of
some type it looks like you're an oil
painting of yourself in aged oil
painting you're a Vermeer of Freddie I'm
having that same issue around my stash
area but the rest of my magical side
doesn't look crazy no it doesn't this is
my makeup forever side looks nice this
side actually doesn't look crazy like it
looks okay I'm trying to get a good
close-up of my flakes but all you can
really see is like my mustache so not
only as a dad to still go to beat it up
and in turn causing my foundation capito
but it's like not blending really at all
I don't shine it I'm being fat on my
face right now okay here is Freddie
sagittal side I do see that the little
peeling part it's mostly actually just
right here on your forehead
really
where I can see it the most yeah we
recommend with great also the left side
in my mouth it feels like I just left
isn't it yeah now my bottom lip too is
like a little it's going through but we
read the rest of my faces that feel like
anything but it's right here I think
that we tested this I think I think that
we put battle on our faces and we have
numb upper lips to show for it yeah I
just like this make up forever primer a
lot of thought it would nice I think
that you know if you need to you can and
use your dad to filter in a pinch
what type of pinch like house would be a
must depend to be for you to use Des
Moines primers I think that I would
probably go without primer they need I
can't - I feel like I'm just going to
chalk it up to the fact but communities
like way better making yeah so like it's
very possible that like she can use a
chisel because she knows like the
strokes to do and like how to apply it
not really working out for us that well
