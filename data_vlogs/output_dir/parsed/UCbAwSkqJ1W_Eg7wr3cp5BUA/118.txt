teenage metabolism chat guys oh my god
those the cutest news ever
I used to drink orange juice and eat
sleep okay fluffy that would love you
hello friends and welcome to another
video freddie is here with me today
hi hi Freddie hi we are going to be
doing something a little chilly today
using cheeto bronzer and that Kido craze
like a lot of thing a lot a Cheetos you
know and have a really like a huge cult
following the flame is hot
alright so good regular P notify flaming
hot light every day after clean bit of a
graze I used to beat slim hot cheetos
and drink Orangina and not was like my
snack people would be very impressed
because I could like to be slimming on
you might handle and untrained examine
basically it's just supposed to look
exactly like cheeto done this is not a
collab this is not cheeto by to Sadie
and literally made by cheeto the company
they have a lot of crazy flag like
understand ago I thought what better to
do today and to put cheeto bronzer to
the test against literal cheetah actual
teases we're going to see if this
cheetah bronzer a look crazy or be does
actually look like Tito does or see if
you should also just buy Cheetos and put
them on your people a bit I think we
should start with the browser I'm
excited to do it it it look like and
I'll go let's talk about the picture
it's hard and you have to activate it
with water and honestly I think it's
going to look good on you and the middle
is very orange and white we have these
little baby blenders they're the Real
Techniques ones okay so I'm going to do
one side rather than one then okay yeah
let's do right side bronzer website
literal cheeto oh it is very iconic is
it already showing us oh yeah it's
filling up more yellow wait absolute
same why is this opposed to a definitely
while on the skin and it looks in the
container
Wow look
this could be fun for like three you
know we use too much water I feel like
it came out too pigmented off of that I
feel like this would be fun if you were
dressing up as a cheeto I like this
better as lipstick I don't get anything
wrong with that it looks like a very
vibrant with acrylic yellow hey yeah
where's Chester cheetah do being June 18
how does the Angelina des is more orange
milligan actual Tia I don't know that
this is the sushi no color to be honest
well I don't need it like that's pretty
much all there is to the bronzer so
let's do the cheeto do you want the pup
or the country I think let's try it
let's down to the pub after have two
different I don't love them as much as I
love normal Cheetos thing but there's
fun with the texture okay so we're gonna
okay the first one is reading I'm gonna
just try and own alien this is great
it's this little bits of I mean it's
there I'm going to kind of crunchy soon
in addition to the class I got a normal
crunchy one that looks a little bit like
a baseball club I think that you would
probably break out very quickly if you
actually put cheeto on your face like
Adam a couple of the day but I think
that the cheetah looks better than the
cheeto bronzer yeah yeah it really does
I thought this would be stupid but it's
kind of working if you look cute on
YouTube yeah no matted on it should we
try and grind these things up and please
get any more out of it and are we gonna
grant and just take like a camera oh I
do have a hammer okay so we are going to
mash these Cheetos and then see if the
powder that's produced is even better
because like maybe we'll be more
distilled yes a pure pigment
these things exactly really fun take it
yep
nailed it look at the camera hahaha
hammer looks tasty so we have a know a
bowl full of cheeto dust maybe even you
get someone my head I think this might
be worth yeah cuz they're getting me
inside we don't want the inside yeah
okay I'm going to go back with the real
cheeto I honestly think that just going
in with the normal crunch is the best
way to go like the crunchy ones put it
right on the face cheeto bronzer cheeto
dust these are actual Cheetos around on
to my face you guys I think the the
verdict might be that real Cheetos look
better than Kido bronze actual she knows
more subtle they are the actual color of
Kannada from far away it kind of looks
nice do you think Oh Oh Freddie I'm
hungry
yes I'm a flaming hot yes snacks God
these things look so good oh I'm not
going to be ready do this and I'm
probably going to say that you guys
probably don't do this
seems like putting chilli flakes on your
face not a good idea but I'm just going
to see if it adds anything to my look
gonna take a nice an improbably
this afterwards there's growth but
mm-hmm it's got so little we know yeah I
can for suresies this is the flaming hot
it's very pigment just entangling it I
mean I'm sure my face might hurt a
little bit in a couple of minutes huh so
right now it feels okay I'm going to say
just for your own safety and skin safety
I'm not going to recommend you put
flaming hot cheetos on your face but
it's your life I can't tell you to do
anything I mean if you're ever feeling
like you want to get some aggression out
that's true mashing Tina's is not the
worst idea
