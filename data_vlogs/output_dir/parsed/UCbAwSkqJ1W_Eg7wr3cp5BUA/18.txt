hello friends and welcome to another
video this week I'm gonna be getting a
so called perfect makeover based on my
features aka my skin tone hair color eye
color and face and body shape growing up
I always used to see these articles in
teen magazines with titles like how to
dress for your body type or what haircut
flatters your face shape or which
lipstick goes with your skin's
undertones and though I would often read
them I never really applied them to my
style choices opting instead for then
long hair frosted eyeshadow and late
2000s miniskirts and Henle shirts and
now what I would call my comfortable
vampire aesthetic now obviously I don't
a hundred percent buy into the idea that
you have to wear certain things just
based on people's advice on what goes
well with your features but I thought it
would be interesting to try and get a
head-to-toe makeover
based off of these commonly held
conceptions to see one how different it
is from what I usually do and two if
there's anything I can incorporate to
flatter myself more that I also actually
like so with a combination of some
research and some help from a couple of
experts hairstylist and youtuber Brad
mondo and style guru Stacy London I'm
gonna be getting a new hairdo a new
outfit and a new face of makeup all
designed to flatter me well specifically
my body and also my face to New York
City we go so first up is hair so I'm
here in New York City with Brad mondo
hai who is a hair stylist and a youtuber
you may know him from such hits as hair
dresser reacts to America's Next Top
Model makeovers who's better you're her
but he's also done a couple of videos
about like the best haircuts for your
face shape and the best hair color for
your skin tone so I figured he'd be the
perfect expert to help me on my journey
yes I'm so excited to your hair this is
gonna be amazing and we're gonna make it
perfect your skin tone for that face
shape honey that doesn't mean we're
gonna have to say goodbye to the gray
hair but you know
we had like a good month uh-huh I had
like a good like five or six weeks with
his hair and I'm feeling good unreal
yeah it has been real we're gonna say
goodbye today so first up was the cut
which I wanted to get to suit my face
shape got to pull this hair off your
face we're gonna accentuate her good
parts and diminish the bad parts there's
no bad parts but the sideburns and
leggings from what I can tell there are
six basic face shapes you can have
combinations or variations of them but
these are the six that people usually
start from they are oval oblong round
heart-shaped Square and diamond to me
you definitely have more of a
heart-shaped face because your chin kind
of goes inwards to a point and then it
kind of gets wider on the top so the
ideal face shape is an oval for a female
because it's symmetrical all way around
with the same width at the forehead and
at the chin given the fact that I have a
heart-shaped face the idea behind a
perfect haircut would be to give the
illusion that I'm actually an oval what
I want to do is take your hair up to
around the collarbone mmm we ran out a
little bit of layering around her face
just to kind of accentuate the jaw more
keep all the weight kind of heavy down
here to bring attention down here and
then keep the side part the way it is
perfect so before the cutting began we
had to get my hair wet which was a bit
more of a challenge than we anticipated
first we had a sink malfunction I don't
think it work oh and then when we found
a usable sink can you fit back there
girl it was a pretty tight squeeze for
Brad's thighs I don't that's gonna get
high it's like okay oh it's waking me up
oh yeah
oh that's what I like to feel we go and
then we were ready to commence the cut
I love chopping off hair it's so
satisfying almost awesome you had it
short so the last time I cut my hair was
December of 2016 I know that you've done
a bunch of America's Next Top Model like
makeover reactions but I love when they
like cut it off and like hand it to the
girl and she's like like hysterically
Cassandra why you crying
hello lay here I'm not sure that my cut
was ANTM level dramatic but we were
actually getting rid of a fair amount of
hair I'm gonna shave it up for this so
that would be a surprise but listen if
it suits my face shape I guess we must
we didn't actually end up doing any
shaving that day but we did end up
getting to that long bob leg he had
described so we just finished cutting
for the most part we're gonna blow dry
it and then I'm gonna do a little bit
more refining I'm very excited about the
link I feel like a lot lighter the ends
have been living for a while like the
ends are didn't with it yeah okay so
what's next
bronze the color now the best part the
most fun part which we based around my
skin's undertones which are the colors
that come from underneath your skin to
affect its overall hue these are mostly
interpreted as being either warm toned
aka yellow peach or golden or cool toned
aka blue pink or red but there are also
a couple of combination wildcard
undertones like neutral and olive and
honestly I've never been able to figure
out what exactly my undertones are I
know that in your video where you were
like talking about how to figure out
your skin tone you said to like look at
the veins on your arm yeah what's that
about so usually blue is cool and green
your veins is warmer tones so looking at
my wrists my veins do seem kind of blue
which would mean that I have cool
undertones but I also see a little bit
of green in there or like at least teal
so we decided to rely more on my face
than on my wrists I mean I definitely
see paint in your skin but I also see
warmth so what I'm gonna say is that
your skin is neutral but more on the
cool side basically that means you can
pretty much pull off any hair color
oh no so Brad decided that we should
just warm me up a little bit with some
lighter brown highlights you know just
that really pretty sunkissed natural
looking color that'll make you look
really healthy and glowy
I'm down for that we're still gonna keep
her in the brown family not too too
light but it's nothing to be different
than what you have now he started off by
bleaching the spots where we wanted the
highlights to go her paintin girl we're
just doing some Sun Bob Ross we had to
deal with mine
sure old dark hair as well as the old
gray dye so overall the bleach was
definitely the most time consuming step
right what how would you got my hair no
no I like what you have going on like I
like no I well just because if you guys
see what Tyler looks like at this very
moment so returning to my hair journey
hello
we finally finished applying the bleach
oh you are gonna belong and your hair
looks just like perfectly oh oh oh
hello so all we had left to do was to
rinse I never thought I'd be a blonde
and yet here we are and add some Brown
back in we're nothing gonna tone her
make it a lot darker than it is so looks
natural stove these are the oh my god
Wow but unfortunately we were running
out of time because the YouTube space
closes like right at 9 p.m. we're the
time crunch girl speeds scalp massage
I'm a fan can you just like take a
moment to appreciate my stance right now
I'm completely horizontal in like an
only moderately sexual way makeover
video cut sexual it's more like gone
ob/gyn prenatal stance aside we were
getting close to the birth of my new
hairdo I'm very excited it's gonna be a
change that's what life's about right
change
evolution a personal journey yet towards
death and with that done we had to go
thank you YouTube for letting us film
here but we're about to get kicked out
so we're gonna head to Tyler's sister's
apartment nearby to finish off the job
I promised Brad we're not trying to
abduct you alright we're here
and Bradish is putting a second toner i
mean just a darken it up just a little
bit more and then we're gonna go in for
the finishing cut we once again ran into
some trouble trying to actually wash my
hair which staying true to form required
some contorting and also some ab
exercises like or dworkin then it was
time for some final snips and layers a
quick blow-dry a few curls and an LED
panel to just make for a little bit more
of a dramatic reveal that's a toughie
but it's fashion and then it was finally
time for me to see my perfect hair Oh
Wow it's definitely very different from
what we started with but I really like
it I love the length the length is
everything and I like these little
pieces oh it looks really good no I just
I just look I'm hello so in the end the
layered long bob that we ended up with
brings more weight to around my chin and
it has a little bit of a side-swept bang
to take away from my forehead and the
lighter brown highlights have both warm
and cool tones to vibe with my neutral
complexion all right so you would say
this definitely fulfills the requirement
of a hair makeover that's suited to my
features honey one hundo Posehn
thank you so much for having change you
killed it thank you thank you that was
we both killed it a week high five for a
strong makeover so that took care of our
perfect haircut but next up we needed to
find our perfect outfit so I'm here with
style guru Stacy London who's gonna help
me figure this out well we're gonna try
we're gonna try so basically I'm looking
for the in quotes perfect outfit that
will flatter my physical attributes the
best you know sort of like take into
account my body shape and my skin tone
and like my complexion coloring that
type of stuff yeah so Stacy who's been a
stylist for many years and was one of
the hosts of the TV show what not to
wear is definitely aware of these types
of feature driven clothing rules but her
actual personal guidelines for style are
more open-ended every item of clothing
every piece of makeup every way you cut
your hair which looks great by the way
thank you has to do one of two things
that's the criteria it has to be have a
use value for you and your closet and it
should bring you joy at least one but
ideally both I don't know if you can
read my mind necklace but it does say
being perfect it does it's quite nice
but for the purposes of this video I do
just want to be like a set of features
kind of like a glorified mannequin okay
so let's start with the first thing how
do you dress now I would call my current
style comfortable vampire like I said
that is when I have not heard yeah so
right off the bat
Stacy let me know that she thought my
complexion was soon
two more color than I usually go for you
have incredibly beautiful skin tone you
have big eyes in this this color of your
hair
all of this lends itself to color and
one thing that people used to do this is
like so 80s is to tell you like what
season you are based on your color I was
hoping you'd bring this up because I
have never been able to figure it out
like that's because people aren't
seasoned it seasons are seasons right
there are a lot of old school metaphors
that are used when categorizing one's
features there are the seasons for
complexions which Stacy mentioned as
well as fruits and vegetables used when
referring to your body shape whenever I
try to use these metaphors I feel like
I'm always stuck between autumn and
winter for coloring because I have dark
hair but pale skin and I usually guess
pear for body shape since I have small
boobs but a decent sized badonk okay I
know you don't want to do these things
yes would you tell me what season and
what fruit I would be that someone else
would say okay I would yes that somebody
would say that you're an autumn okay
which generally implies that I have
warmer skewing coloring with dark hair
and brown eyes and because I can't see
your body shape yet I can't tell you
what fruit you would be you're also not
a utensil so I'm never gonna call you a
spoon or a fork or knife I don't know
what is which one is that listen I I'm
an old dog I've heard every trick so in
order to truly figure out which fruit or
I guess utensil I am we've got to take
this sweatshirt off and put you in
something else and take a look at the
shape of your body all right so I have
my tank top on Stacy you do you actually
have my tank top on that's true ah it's
her tank top so here's the thing I'm
looking at your body and it's pretty
straight up and down right so I'm not
gonna call you a knife I'm not gonna
call you I don't even know what's a
straight up-and-down fruit a rhubarb but
I see delery nuts
Hilary that's not a fruit but still it's
an iam a but in the edible area well you
don't her down at the bottom so I
wouldn't call you a banana either so
from the front stacy concluded that i
was more of a knife but once i turned to
the side she got a better view of the
you've got a great high ass oh thank you
okay so we want to fly I mean these
jeans also just get a look at this this
is what happens when you're young
there's no puckering here this is this
be I miss these days I gotta be honest
with you now I'm looking at that and I
would say oh okay maybe you're a little
bit more than you carry your weight on
your bottom half
but what I would definitely say is that
your weight is not on your top hat no
right it's bit there but the I mean but
that's not to say you don't have good
boobs because he did one of the things
that you have in your favor as Dora
licks your feet is that you have nice
broad shoulders so what you may not have
in terms of chest size is still very
complimentary in terms of balancing your
bottom half with your tops but I don't
see a defined waist and that's the one
thing that I would say would most
determine the way that I would look at
your body right is that we need to
create a waistline for you to have what
we call a classic female form which is
hourglass now that doesn't mean you have
to have it but generally speaking that's
the way clothing is cut for women so
much like my haircut was meant to oval
eyes my heart-shaped face stacy
recommended that we find cuts that
changed my rhubarb shape into more of an
hourglass shaped fruit or vegetable like
a deformed tomato or something or what
about a bok choy it's kind of got like a
bootie and then like some hair on top
that's me so I went off to find myself
some waist defining garments this is the
part of what not to wear where I get to
shop by myself except Stacy doesn't come
and help me at the end you could text
her though so now that we've established
your shape we kind of know what we want
to be looking for the easiest most
Universal way to create a waist is to
find something like an easy dress like a
fit-and-flare dress this is kind of
interesting
it definitely has like a little waist
cinching action all right I'm gonna try
this on I think this is like the right
type of garment that Stacy was
recommending but I feel like the fit is
just not perfect like the waistline is
almost too high the sleeves are a little
tight but I think with color and I
we're on the right track in terms of
color recommendations overall Stacy
mostly agreed with Brad and that she
thought my skin was pretty neutral you
don't have a lot of yellow undertone in
your skin you don't have a lot of blue
undertone in your skin easily I can see
you in dark purple in Burgundy in dark
green this is interesting there's some
shine there's some olive green or muted
green there is a stitch at the waist I
think now I don't think this one fits me
quite right either first off my bra is
just like out and second off it doesn't
Elite Flair on the bottom it clean is
more which is not ideal but I do kind of
like the color and the beads it actually
ended up being pretty tough to find a
fit-and-flare dress that fit all of our
specs
so besides fit-and-flare dresses Stacy
had also mentioned that we could do like
a wide-legged pant when you do a really
skinny jean as opposed to something a
little bit wider you wind up creating
the visual effects that we see this more
than we see your whole leg right we want
something that creates a longer line so
we went on the hunt or wide-legged pant
listen I haven't found it yet but I
smell it really good shopping showering
down oh that's good as a final note
Stacy wanted to emphasize that things
would look different with my new hair
especially color wise it's not that your
coloring dictates what colors you can
wear totally but you are going to find
that you pop more in certain neutrals
and pop more in certain colors based on
the fact that you have a new hair color
this is true I have not explored
anything really I've only really come to
your house with this new hair color so
well you came to the right place so
after exploring a few stores
I found something panty that I thought
fit all of the guidelines all right so
this isn't a dress but it does have a
waist cincher mechanism and it has these
pant legs that are the same width all
the way down and it's green
it's a little bit of a pattern so I'm
gonna try it on and see if it could be
the one alright so this is my green
stripe jumpsuit I don't think I was
expecting to like the stripes but I
think I do and I do like this sort of
like muted but not too dark green color
it is not a dress and it's not really a
fit-and-flare but the top is definitely
fitted and then the pant legs are like
straight down and not tapered at the
ends so it's hitting a lot of good stuff
I'm gonna text a pic of this to Stacy
and see what she thinks all right so it
looks like Stacy likes this jumpsuit and
she says wider leg and vertical line
print makes you look like a tall glass
of water love the focus on the waist so
let's get this guy and then get some
accessories to finish it off Stacy also
recommended that we pick up some gold
jewelry to go with my she wouldn't call
it autumn but autumn complexion and she
also suggested some flat or wedge
sandals so with the outfit purchased it
was time for the final touch of our
perfect makeover the makeup so for the
makeup portion we decided to use the
information we had gathered from Stacy
and Brad and combine it with some
research to customize a look around my
features I read a lot of articles for
this you guys I'm prepared so I think
like the first feature we'll be focusing
on is the eyes so I'm gonna do my
eyebrows really quick and then we can
talk about how we are gonna flatter my
eyes with eye shadow so there are two
elements to consider here one is my eye
shape and the other is my eye color
after looking at a bunch of photos I've
concluded that I have mildly protruding
eyes I deduced this by looking at all of
the possible i shaped listed and then
eliminating the other ones but they also
harp on the fact that protruding eyes
have a lot of lid space which I do and
the tips to flatter that type of eye
shape are basically just like you can
put a lot of stuff on your eyelid so I
could have like a very large amount of
eyeliner I can do some dark eye shadow
if you do a smoky eye I could just
really layer it on thick because I think
the idea of doing your eye shadow
according to your eye shape is to
correct whatever shape you have into
more of like
a neutral almond eye besides that I have
dark brown eyes and there are a few
different eyes shadow colors that
compliment brown eyes it seems like
either you can go with like bold shocks
of color like cobalt blue or purple or
you can do something a little gold ear
like gold copper and green so because
the jumpsuit that we have is green I
think I'm gonna stay in the like gold
with a bit of greenish gold family and
hopefully that'll flatter my eyes and my
outfit alright so since the instructions
were basically go ham I shall go ham I
can't tell if I feel more complimented
but I'm definitely feeling more dramatic
I'm also gonna be using this green color
from the Pirates of the Caribbean
palette which we bought for a video and
never made all right so this is a couple
of eyeshadow colors on there but
considering that I have protruding eyes
I shall go in for one more darker color
they said go ham I'll give them a roast
this is a luau over here hahaha so I'm
gonna blend this out really quick and
then just slap on some foundation and
concealer and then we'll move on to the
blush and lipstick which is very
contingent on my skin's undertones so
we'll talk about those so once again
both Stacy and Brad when looking at my
skin said and I had overall neutral
undertones but when I went to get a
third opinion at Sephora by you know
getting color I queued by their little
face scanner they seemed to think I was
neutral but slightly warm the color that
they initially scanned was 2 y o7
meaning like 2 tones of yellow away from
medium but after some swatching and
testing we ended up settling on 1 y o7
so we tried a more neutral tone I think
this looks better one of the tricky
things about having a neutral skin tone
is that with these makeup advice
articles a lot of them will just tell
you you can wear whatever you want but I
think in the spirit of having a slightly
lighter hair and Stacy recommending me
gold jewelry I'm gonna continue down
that neutral but slightly warm path so
I'm gonna bring in some peachy blush it
seems like peachy blushes are both like
somewhat universally flattering but also
if you have like warmer
tones you should kind of like stick with
warm stuff is what I'm reading alright
so as we can see I put a lot of that on
I'm going to just blend this out a
little bit more so I can sort of diffuse
it and then we'll move on to the lips
following the trajectory of the color IQ
and the blush we decided to continue
down the slightly warm path usually for
warm undertones they recommend orange
based lipsticks like terra cotta x' or
corals or peaches so i went for this
brick color hello there to finish off
the look I added some pretty thick
eyeliner and a dash of dark green
eyeshadow on the outer corner lower lash
line alright so I think that is my full
face of makeup based on my features all
in all I'm pretty into this look I think
that overall it's not like crazy far off
from what I do normally but I think that
there are a couple of things that are
different mainly the amount of eye
shadow that's on my eyes and also like
any sort of like lower lash situation so
now that my makeup is done I think it's
time to put all three of the pieces of
my perfect makeover together and see
what I look like so this is my final
head-to-toe perfect makeover no longer a
rhubarb no I am a
there you go this look definitely
includes some elements that I do
currently wear but there are also some
things that are more new to me in
particular the color palette from top to
bottom is much warmer than I usually go
I think in general this is more of just
like a summer Sofia look I used to be a
comfortable vampire now I'm a cinched
garden gnome the shapes however I feel
like I've at least dabbled in before
I've had my hair this length before and
despite the amount of like long sleeves
sweatshirts I wear I'm not against
cinching my waist listen I'll give Stacy
that this is like a nice human body
shape but sometimes I like to dress up
like a bat so maybe we'll do half the
time hourglass and you know the other
half of the time just flying squirrel in
terms of what things from this makeover
I'll incorporate going forward I'm not
sure if I'll really stick with the
warmer color palette but I could
definitely see myself keeping my hair
short putting on some more eyeshadow
when I get the chance and also embracing
wide legged pants you look very
comfortable I am very comfortable
regardless of body shape that's one
thing about wide leg pants I feel a
little bit more like pajamas than skinny
pants you're so damn lucky you wear gym
shorts every day what so all in all in
terms of this being my perfect makeover
I do think that it complements my
physical features and gets them a bit
closer to being ideal and it was a fun
experiment overall there's obviously the
question of why these ideals or rules
even exist and I think to touch on it
briefly they're related to instinctual
preferences based on perceived fertility
geometry and also just like societal
constructs but I think that's all a bit
much to unpack in this video so for now
I think we can just take them at face
value and see them as more of a jumping
off point for style or color
recommendations and not the end-all
be-all of what you should wear
or even what not to wear right Stacy
