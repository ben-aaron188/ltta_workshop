hello friends and welcome to another
video today I am going to be melting one
of every lipstick from Sephora together
into one giant mega lipstick that's
right we're taking bad makeup science to
the next level so I've previously mixed
all my nude lipsticks my foundations
eyeshadows liquid lipsticks and
highlighters together and honestly I've
been surprisingly pleased with the
results but of course all of those
experiments were limited to my makeup
collection things that I bought for
myself to suit my own tastes complexion
skin type etc so I thought if I could
buy one of every lipstick from Sephora
and melt them all together into a batch
of Franken forá-- lipsticks I would be
able to both satisfy my ever-growing
desire to melt makeup and also get an
insight into what Sephora thinks are its
most marketable lipstick colors because
presumably what will emerge from the
fiery depths of this mixture is the mid
point of all of sephora's lipstick
shades now obviously when I melt down
all of these lipsticks I'm gonna make
more than just one lipstick so I'm gonna
take these extra tubes that I make and
give them back to you guys as a
subscriber giveaway I'm sorry it's not a
MacBook Air it's just a bad makeup
science experiment that you might not
even want after I've put my grubby hands
all over them but I thought it'd be fun
to share them with you guys as a novelty
item and we'll share the rules for the
giveaway at the end of the video as an
additional note to address the question
of how the hell are we gonna do this
this video is sponsored by quinn now if
you haven't heard of quid it's a free
app that you can get right now on the
app store that basically has tons of
stickers gifts and tradable cards for
different TV shows movies youtubers and
other fandoms that you can collect and
share so it's kind of like bitmoji but
with a wider variety of things the
feature that I love is that you can
integrate the stickers into your
iMessage keyboard and then send them
like emoji Quinn actually made us our
own Stu
pack so if you download the app you can
get that and then harass all of your
friends with Krusty's face so a big
THANK YOU to Quinn for helping us
produce our non-fda-approved Franken
forum makeup line and I hope you guys go
check them out and download the app if
you want to try it out all right let's
do this so based on some cursory
research we don't have enough money even
with our sponsorship to buy one of every
lipstick sold on sephora.com
so instead we decided to focus this
experiment on what Sephora stocks in
their actual stores all right so I've
got my GoPro strapped to my chest and
we're gonna go try and buy one of every
lipstick that the Sephora stops which
narrows the scope of this midpoint
lipstick - what Sephora and their
vendors think will actually market and
sell in person
I don't know what's gonna happen in
there I don't know how they're gonna
react to this hopefully my credit card
works and hopefully we can actually
afford to buy all the lipsticks that
they have just so we're not mixing too
many elements I'm gonna make sure that
every product we buy is a traditional
lipstick not a liquid lipstick gloss
pencil or balm but I'm open to any
finish including sheer metallic matte
cream whatever there is the dynamic of
like what if a lipstick is sold out and
I'm sure there's gonna be one or two
colors that are just plain not there but
if I notice that a lot of colors are
missing from a particular brand or line
I'm gonna make sure to fill in as many
blanks as I can by going to another
Sephora it's not exact makeup science
it's bad makeup science oh my god I
can't believe we just did that we had to
call our bank ito
it was okay this is nuts I can't wait we
have so many good colors I would like to
say a giant thank you to everyone who
was working at that Sephora you guys
helped us check out all these lipsticks
and you put up with us and I know we're
insane so yeah
all right so we're here with all of our
lipsticks ready to get a choppin
smacking and melting we're actually at a
boba shop in downtown LA right now
called milk and tea because we needed a
true utilitarian kitchen so basically
what we've done is we've separated all
the lipsticks out by like color category
we've got nudes Reds pinks purples
oranges Browns miscellaneous others so
this is gonna be an adventure
alright so let's start off with
something I've melted before which is
nudes you're like King Kong right now
now that they're all uncapped the
lipstick smell is just like wafting
around the room I feel like these are
like the terracotta soldiers you know
there's just rows and rows of them and
some of them have different jobs as a
couple of magistrates if you put
soldiers a few cavalry men it's all
coming together so I think the way I'm
gonna do this is basically grab them
swatch them and then put them into the
pot all right ready as ready as I can be
all right and then at the end after
we've got all of our lipsticks inside
then we'll turn up the heat and try and
melt these things all together the thing
that's really motivating me here is the
end product I know that we're gonna end
up with you know hopefully hundreds of
new baby lipsticks so I'm okay
destroying some makeup usually it would
hurt me but I'm trying to think past
that you're like a bocce chef I call
this one urban decay in the pocket I
feel like I'm even like getting more
lipstick out than you usually would I
feel like usually when you get to the
bottom of the lipstick where you can't
push up any more I usually give up but
listen I'm getting down into the
nitty-gritty stops actually saving
lipstick exactly waste not want not is
what this video is all about alright so
it's been about what would you say
thirty minutes so in about thirty
minutes of me swatching and chopping and
scooping and I haven't really made that
much of a dent into the nude lipsticks
so I'm gonna have Tyler help me I
couldn't do it all by myself here for
backup I've washed my hands so I'm ready
to dive in Tyler I've been trying really
hard not to forget to swatch don't
forget to swatch
oh you got one oh it's very satisfying
all right and scoop out the insides I
love pulling them out that's so fun I
feel like I got every last drop what
happened they forgot to swatch the last
two it's too late
Tyler I'm just throwing it off all right
so this is the last lipstick of all of
our nudes this is the kat von d Ludwig
Wow and that's how Ludwig died all right
nudes the chick okay so we've got all of
our red lipsticks laid out right over
here ready to be smacked in a few things
have changed first off we've swatched
all of them already so that step is out
of the way so hopefully we'll be a bit
swifter yes all right I'm gonna go in oh
yeah
going ham already see now that we don't
have to swatch life's different life is
better so Tyler has prototype this saw
and extract with knife method it's a fun
challenge but it only really works with
hard lipsticks oh yes Siana sausage will
never let you down her lipsticks are
hard I like a firm mattress and a hard
lipstick I call this one the Wolverine
oh my god this started at guillotine and
it's like now sort of progressed to like
13th century torture methods yeah
whoever knocks it in but keeps theirs
wins ready now we're gonna knock it on
the floor I do not condone I did not see
all right so these are the last two reds
that is the worst feeling Oh someone
left a bit too soon
all right Reds done okay so we've got
all our pink lipsticks laid out here I
thought that the Reds were the most
populous of all the lipsticks but I
think it's actually the Pink's I've so
rarely wear pink lipstick
it's an interesting thing to be
confronted with so many there's me some
scoop porn right here right whoo I
honestly think the pink ones might be
softer they're very soft I think it has
something did you look like the coloring
with a formula well the color affects
the formula ah are you trying to
introduce some good makeup science into
this no never uh Nastasia is my girl oh
my god leave me alone so once
done with the pink I feel like the only
large grouping left are the purples the
rest of them are pretty small for a
striking distance I think we're almost
there we might run out of time to
actually do the melting here tonight
most of the reason we were at this boba
place was to use their freezer for the
mold yeah but we might just have to
stick them in our freezer just clear it
out oh well that is the very last pink
boom
all right so up next is a little
interstitial category the Browns see
these are more my speed I like a good
brown lipstick I don't know about all
these pink ones
I didn't the invisible hand of Sephora
corporate development chose more pinks
okay yeah you just got to put up with it
I think the Browns might be a bit firmer
oh yeah I am on a roll right now I was
getting no no as I say that I just cut
one in half you choked I shouldn't have
said anything
Oh Oh that was pretty good there it is
there she blows
what are you gonna get out of here with
your boba straw you put it put it in the
pot damn it all right so that's the
Browns check up next with purples purple
is a little bit of a loose definition
here I would call them purple slash
berry lipsticks yes but this is our last
big hurdle and then we just have some
fun ones left makeup Forever's are
impossible I don't know I just don't
think you're stroking it quite right
one thing I'm under ADA going into this
is just how real the trash-talking me
well you were trash-talking me from the
beginning when you were behind the
camera you weren't doing it right
cut to compilation of Tyler mistakes cut
to compilation of Tyler forgetting to
swatch in the first round you just watch
that one did you swatch that one yes I
did this is the definition of swagger
right here I dunno welcome I'm not gonna
look either I'm just gonna look straight
to the camera do that work nothing
happened I was trying to call my shot
this isn't me a Babe Ruth I'm gonna do a
no-look around this one ready all right
no look perfect
extraction oh that was pretty legit oh
my god I did that you walk away
all right yeah all right so Purple's
chick all right so these are our last
lipsticks that we have left we've got
basically our oranges and our
miscellaneous colors which are kind of
like white black blue gray and green
let's do oranges first and then the
string
ones last the oranges are impossible the
oranges are so annoying they're a little
pulpy if you know what I mean
all right let me see if I can't at least
get the last one out perfectly
oh that's nice smooth like an eel what's
that's what I am no I'm like the weird
colors a little bit harder to predict
yeah like all the grays I've gotten has
been very soft but all the blacks and
blues have been very stiff which is how
I like them okay so we are finally on
our very last lipstick this is the
honest sauce at Beverly Hills lipstick
in insomniac which is fitting because
we're up pretty late right now yeah oh
what a way to end it why are we so
excited about this really stupid skill
that was the sexiest thing I've ever
seen okay so those are all of our
lipsticks that took us about what three
and a half hours to do so we are out of
time here in the store so we're gonna
take our pot of lipsticks home with us
and melt them in the morning and we'll
just figure out the freezer situation
let's go all right so we're back at our
house in our kitchen with our giant pots
full of lipstick so I'm gonna turn this
hot plate on - it's like highest setting
and try and melt them all down into our
final mega Franken Sephora formula this
rolls off the tongue there is a sort of
like critical mass of lipstick in there
like there's a lot of layers to melt
through so if we have to assist it from
the top
we will alright so it's been probably
about an hour and there has been some
progress with the melting but I think
that we kind of need to help this along
otherwise I'm just gonna have to leave
this hot plate on overnight like a
legitimate crock-pot so we've got a
couple of things to assist in the
melting process the first of which our
hair driers all right let's see ready oh
it's moving so that's melting oh yeah so
the hairdryer kind of worked but I want
to try something a little more powerful
such as the blowtorch all right I've got
my safety stuff on my goggles my gloves
don't do any blowtorching without you
know being safe and with that let's
begin oh yeah that one white one is like
already like just completely
disintegrated when it starts smoking I
start getting nervous
I feel like the blowtorch is like the
inside of Mount Doom and the hairdryer
is like the hot winds of Mordor all
right I think we've done a decent amount
of heating from the bottom and from the
top so I'm gonna grab one of my spatulas
and just start mixing it together and I
think it like turning it over will help
it melt completely through like a chunky
still yeah it's like chilly so right now
it's starting to look pretty pinky you
guys saw how many pinks really went into
this but I know that there are some
blues and greens and blacks that are
mixed in there that aren't fully melted
yet you think we should whisk it you
know that's not a bad idea all right
ready
yeah let's go here's the hand mixer No
what should we do
all right ready oh my god
it's bubbling that's working well if
there were any chunks left I think
they're gone now okay so I think we've
got all the chunks out and I think that
some of the air bubbles have come out
with the hairdryer I feel like this hot
plate did a good job of like getting all
the lipstick soft and ready to mix but I
feel like it's not quite keeping it hot
enough to like keep it really liquid so
I'm gonna try and put this on the burner
Oh huh
the thing is like it might not evenly
heat it but I feel like it'll keep it
hotter so I'm just gonna try and get
that as liquidy as possible and then
we'll get that ladle in there and start
pouring it into the molds okay so I've
got my lipstick molds right here yes and
your ladle this is my double double toil
and trouble ladle all right let's see
careful careful very careful oh yeah
well that left something to be desired
I'm gonna try and do better we almost
like need like a bigger ladle or
something
how much bigger ladles and they making
that one I don't know I don't know if
this is what they expected so I'm gonna
fill up the other one and then I'm gonna
put them both in the freezer all the
tragedy of last night is being redeemed
in this rebirth there we go Franken
lipstick in the freezer all right so
it's been 10 minutes so let's see if
they're ready okay so I'm gonna use this
frosting spreader to get rid of the
excess lipstick then I'm gonna open up
the mold and hopefully we'll have our
lipstick ready in there to be tubed
tah-dah
oh my god and there are our lipsticks so
in the end our Franken for a concoction
included 603 lipsticks from 20 different
brands with a hundred and twenty-six
nudes 113 reds 132 pinks 57 Browns 120
purples 21 oranges and 34 unusual colors
they don't all look perfect but they
definitely look like lipsticks all right
so basically I'm gonna put our Franken
lipstick inside of the tube right now
there's precedent they twist up and down
yeah it should twist up and down ready
oh yeah boom and out of those lipsticks
we made 500 tubes for you guys so I
guess about a hundred lips
boiled off or ended up on the pot or the
cutting board congratulations to me on
berthing this lipstick now when we went
back to the Sephora a couple of weeks
later to grab snapshots of the brand
headers I noticed two lip stick displays
that were either new editions or that we
had accidentally missed in our first
buying they total about 25 lipsticks and
the color breakdown seems to be pretty
similar to our general statistics with
the exception of this gold lipstick so
that's my bad but the 603 that we got is
close to every lipstick at the Sephora
or if those are new editions every
lipstick at this Sephora alright ready
for the lip swatch yes oh my god well
that's a hardy lipstick right there this
is the mega Frank and Sephora lipstick
it's kind of crazy that it's actually
here it's finally here I like the color
it is more reddish and pinkish than I
would usually go it's a little festive
it's a little cranberry ish it's a
little rhubarb this is almost even like
an orchid color I could go on and on so
now that I have this and it's on my face
I'm gonna make an tube the rest of these
and then tomorrow I'm gonna wear my tube
all day long and see what happens
alright so it's a couple of days later
and I'm finally ready to do my wear test
of our Megan Franken for a lipstick so
you guys have seen the swatch previously
so I think we can just put it straight
on the mouth oh wow one swipe
Sally is what I'm gonna call this no I'm
not gonna call it that but I could so
that is applied I think the thing I like
the most about this lipstick right off
the bat is not only how pigmented it is
but how like covered my mouth is let's
take a look at the butt hole inner rim
coverage while I say that besides that
the formula feels pretty nice it's
definitely not like drawing down to be
like a matte lipstick at all it's kind
of hovering around that cream area I
wouldn't call it like shiny but it's got
a sheen alright so it's been about 30
minutes inside
put this lipstick on and it's still on
so that's good so our first test for our
Franken for a lipstick is a straw test
so I'm gonna get a nice big iced coffee
with a large straw that I'm gonna take a
few sips and see how this handles like a
transfering challenge you got someone
you tooth already
oh you're Paige alright so basically I'm
just gonna drink this coffee that I so
desperately need and then after I come
back up for air we'll check the straw
and the lips I definitely see a big ol
smudge on this side I think most
traditional lipsticks are not transfer
proof so there wasn't like a really high
chance that this would just be like
perfectly non-transferable but I think
the biggest question to me is how are my
lips gonna look after like drinking this
whole thing and also is this gonna start
transferring around my face so I
finished the whole coffee we were in the
car for about an hour and a half
there's definitely a lot of lipstick on
the straw and Tyler like had his hand
like next to the cup holder so there's
like a little bit of lipstick on his
shirt besides it transferring on to
other things I haven't noticed it like
transferring around my face and I will
say that like from far away my lipstick
still looks pretty good on my mouth
alright so next up for me and this
lipstick oh and Tyler but mostly me in
this lipstick is that we're gonna eat
some ice cream
that's just mustache okay there that one
like incredibly dark hair but there
definitely is a mark of lipstick right
here too so I do think that after eating
this ice cream I've taken a bit of a hit
in the lipstick area now I actually
think the lipstick that's left on my lip
still looks decent
I wouldn't want to reapply yet but I
definitely would want to like clean this
up okay so it's been about five and a
half hours since I first applied the
lipstick and I think at this point there
is definitely still like lipstick left
on my lips but it is definitely like the
last coat of it so we're gonna grab
dinner right now which may destroy this
lipstick even more and then afterwards
we're gonna pop by Sephora and try and
find it dude all right so after all of
our squatching at Sephora the two
lipsticks that ended up being the
closest dupes for our Franken for
lipstick are the NARS lipstick in the
Afghan red and the Sephora lips story's
in Golden Gate actually in this lighting
the NARS looks like the best dupe
I think that there were a lot of
lipsticks like in the same family which
makes sense but actually it was hard to
find a lipstick that was as dusty as
this one a lot of the purples and like
plums were a bit more vibrant alright so
we've reached the end of the day wearing
our Franken for lipstick and I think it
is sort of still on it kind of just
feels like there's like a thin coating
of pink left over from what I applied at
the beginning of the day that said it
feels pretty nice on my lips I don't
feel too dry but I also don't feel like
it's a balm like it does feel like a
full-bodied lipstick so as to what we
should name our Franken for creation I
actually thought that that would be a
great thing to do for the giveaway so I
was thinking that the rules for the
giveaways should be basically that you
just have to be subscribed to this
channel and also that you have to leave
a comment down below as to your
suggestion for the name of this Franken
for a lipstick and will basically go
through and pick winners based on your
name suggestion a couple of disclaimers
we did use a little bit of almond oil
and also latex gloves when removing
these lipsticks from the moulds and also
just because of shipping costs we're
gonna have to limit the giveaway to
subscribers who live in North America so
I'm sorry about that so make sure to
leave your suggestion for the Franken
for a name down below and once again a
big THANK YOU two quid for making this
