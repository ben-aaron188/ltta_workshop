hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm gonna be ordering a
customized mascara online so this
company I echo offers a bespoke mascara
service where you go online and answer a
short quiz and from your answers they'll
make you a personalized mascara formula
with a tailored brush they also offer
this service in person in London Paris
and Hong Kong but since I don't live in
any of those places I'm gonna have to do
it on the good old interwebs I like the
idea of customized or personalized
mascara and I do have a few eyelash
concerns number one being that I have a
couple unruly lashes that sort of grow
in a different direction than they're
supposed to and number two being that
when coated my lashes can tend to get
clumpy or spidery
also I don't know if they can help with
this but I often times hit myself in the
face with my mascara wand as I'm
applying it to my lashes and I'd like to
stop doing that so I'm interested to see
if this customised mascara is any better
than what I'm used to but I also wonder
how much they can really do to customize
your mascara so I'm gonna order one
custom formula based on my eyelash
concerns and then as an investigation
I'm gonna order a second tube with
completely different answers so I can
have two tubes to compare and contrast
alright let's get started I've used the
brand Aiko a couple of times before but
I think they're like a primarily
European based brand so I haven't come
into contact with them a lot the first
thing on their website is yoga
waterproof mascara which I guess is
mascara for when you are doing yoga ah
here we go so they've got this video
that says what makes the perfect mascara
you do ah
wait is there volume oh it's a quiet
video this is basically just like a
silent animated video telling you how to
take this quiz it's at the artistry quiz
test oh and then we've got some reviews
down here fun fact if you have a mascara
emergency in central London you can get
it delivered in 90 minutes all right
Iko coming for postmates swig all right
I think we should just take this quiz
I'm gonna click shop now okay so here's
the first question how would you
describe your natural lashes all right
number one unruly I said that was one of
my last concerns before I think my
lashes are naturally long and medium I
wouldn't call them fine but I also
wouldn't call them full so I guess
that's three options alright question
number two which effect is most
important to you when choosing mascara I
definitely am gonna want length and
definition I don't necessarily need it
to be waterproof but long wearing would
be nice added curl could maybe help for
the unruliness perhaps alright next oh I
just realized there was no option for
stop hitting myself in the face
alright so question number three is now
we've got to know you now that now that
we've got to know you we'd recommend one
of these brushes the first one seems to
be like ultra curly the second one seems
to be like ultra volumizing and the
third one seems to be more like on the
go like do it real quick I kind of want
to see what they think based off of this
quiz I would need so I'm gonna tell them
to choose for me and see how that works
out all right so this little cat says
that he's making my formula and here we
go
it says introducing your bespoke mascara
it's $40 and it says I can monogram it
for $4 sure I like my initials SN that's
me and if I scroll down a little bit
more it tells me a little bit about like
what I've just ordered with natural
conditioners including shea butter our
classic - big formula promises ultra
black smooth application every time and
then for the brush they've chosen quick
fix volume curl and separation in one
sweep okay cool so that is customized
mascara number one so I'm going to add
this to the
bag and then I'm gonna do the Cui's
again just to see how different the
formulas are and how much like your
answers really matter for this one I'm
gonna say that my lashes are curly fine
and short I don't think I would say any
of those things about my current lashes
so for the second question I think I'm
gonna choose that I want a volumizing
effect a body boosting effect and I also
want it to be waterproof
all right next so looking at the brushes
two of them I haven't seen before the
first brush though is the quick fix
brush which is what they gave me with my
last formula all right well I'm gonna
ask them to choose for me again just to
see what they have to say alright here
we go so it does look like for the your
formula blurb that they've written
something different but my last formula
was also a tubing formula so I'm not
sure if that's like one of their
favorite things for like a lot of
different lash types or if it's actually
a very similar formula and for my brush
they've chosen for me the twist and
shout short spirals will extend and
lengthen each and every lash so they did
give me a different brush which is cool
all right Tyler drove me to my monogram
this for you yeah alright so the second
one is the Tyler Williams so I've got
two customized mascaras in my bag and
they're also giving me a free waterproof
shadow liner let's check out so I think
I placed my order now they gave me free
48-hour FedEx delivery which is fun
because I usually have to wait months
for things to come in the mail to me but
anyways next time you see me I'll have
one customized mascara and one
customized mascara alright
so both of my custom mascaras have
arrived it did take a little bit more
than 48 hours I'd say it took probably
like three to five days but I believe I
have both of them in here so let's open
them up and take a look and see how they
are and also how different they are from
each other cut off a piece of paper and
it'll cat he says lash alert alerts your
lashes the British are coming
oh wow this is fancy so I try and break
the seal or no just kidding I can't
break it I'm going around it
I have what looks like - very fancy pins
alright so this is the me and my shadow
waterproof shadow liner which is oh my
god well it's gonna stick that back in
there but then that didn't happen so
basically I've got like a little bit of
like a stick shadow on one side and on
this side have a brush I'm a little
confused by this product I'm gonna put
that away and these are our custom
mascaras this one is mine you see the SN
on the side and Tyler that's yours wait
go back
alright so I'm gonna start off with my
customized mascara and apply it to my
right eye whoa oh there's a mirror in
there hello hello what are you doing on
that and then I'm gonna guess that this
is our mascara and I think this little
card says the ingredients right let's
unwrap this guy whoa
on one side it's got the e with the
crown and on the other sighs it says the
original tube mascara hold up hold up I
paid four dollars extra for my mascara
to be monogrammed but I think the only
thing they did is add these stickers I
thought that they were just like letting
me know which was which and I thought
that the bottle would have some sort of
itching into it but it does not I think
I paid four dollars for these two
stickers that makes me a little bit
upset all right shall I open it yes I
don't care what you say I'm opening it
anyway okay alright so this formula is
supposed to add length and definition
curl and it's also supposed to last like
all day
the quick fix brush is basically just
supposed to do it fast like in one sweep
do all of the effects and I'm seeing a
lot alright so I'm gonna do the bottom
lashes now oh no hit myself in the face
alright so that is my customized mascara
on this eye I would say that a lot of
the supposed value propositions are
coming through I think that the lashes
look a lot longer than they did before
and I do think that it is much curlier
as well I'm not sure about the
definition it's not clumpy but it's like
a little spidery so on to the next
mascara the TW mascara see you know what
the problem is here now that we have two
of these things and the tubes are not
monogrammed how are we gonna know which
ones which well they're really
maybe you'll be able to tell the
difference but only after you put it on
all right so this brush is the twist and
shout brush it supposed to give me some
volume length curl all that jazz
ready yeah all right so this formula is
supposed to be body boosting volumizing
and also waterproof I'm gonna do the
bottom I have got mascara all over me
all right so I think that that is pretty
much that application of that TW mascara
my first impression of it is that the
effect is somewhat similar but I do like
the brush of the other mascara a lot
more I think that when you're really up
close to the camera like you can tell
like oh this one is curlier and longer
but any further away than that they look
pretty similar okay so those are both of
the customized mascaras I'm gonna wear
them for the rest of the day and see if
like a long wear test illuminates
anything more okay so it's been about
five and a half to six hours since I
first apply this mascara and I have to
say they're both going pretty strong
this right eye is supposed to be long
lasting
I picked the all day Airin a option and
the left eye is not necessarily supposed
to be long lasting but I did specify it
to be waterproof so they're both staying
put pretty much but I think it's time to
test it a little more than just wearing
it around so this first test is the NAP
test so basically I'm gonna take a
little sleep right now I'm gonna start
on one side and then after 10 minutes
Tyler will come in and force me to
rotate to the other side to make a
pancake flip exactly alright sound roll
over and basically we're gonna see if
any mascara rubs off on the pillow oh
you're out of it huh I brought you a
crescent hanger he's gonna eat my
mascara off this is just an excuse for
you to take a nap in the middle of
filming I have engineered this perfectly
anything on the pillow I don't think so
I like it staying on all right 10 more
minutes yeah
Heights often crusty come in cata noises
what I do
yeah there doesn't go your pillow well I
feel like I was really hitting the
pillow that time oh you only got no all
right so I actually think that this
mascara survived the nap pretty well I
don't think any debris came off from
either side and I also don't see any
sort of like smudges underneath my eyes
so I guess there's really only one more
thing to do in the where test and that's
a crying test so I'm gonna go downstairs
and cut some onions alright so I'm here
with an onion and a knife please
no comments on my cutting technique just
like typing I didn't learn the right way
but I now operate on my own scheme feel
any tears there not yet Michael closer
sure oh yeah that was good feel this
years now oh yeah that stings
oh damn those ninjas cuttin onions is
this a meme I don't know in a comment
mean you know what makes me sad what
that little animated spider he's so cute
I know I got some tears there we go I
have a problem time I'm crying more out
of my right eye than my left so we have
an uneven crying distribution yeah I got
my left leg going did anything happen
Oh your mascara looks unscathed can we
spray you in the eyes with like a super
soaker you wanna just throw some water
at my face and with that proof I'll be
fun for you let's try this
oh no I'll stop I won't be on the couch
no okay so I didn't the ball I didn't
get to like tears streaming down my face
sobbing but I definitely had some tears
for me in my eyes and then Tyler threw
some water at my face so I feel like we
like reasonably tested this mascara
within some watery situations I think
that the left eye looks really strong
that's the one that lets you waterproof
and the right eye also looks pretty good
I don't know if it's like a shadow or
what but there does seem to be like the
tiniest little bit of a smudge under
here but I think in general both
mascaras did pretty well so after both
of these mascaras have pretty much like
proved their worth I wanted to take a
look at their ingredients and just see
like how different
they are the actual ingredients I feel
like we shouldn't like go too far into
because I am NOT a chemist and I don't
know exactly what they do but I'll say
that like the first three or four
ingredients are pretty similar and then
the rest of the ingredients seem to be
similar but in different orders which
leads me to believe that the formulas
are in fact at least somewhat different
in their composition also what's
interesting is that printed on the top
of these paper slips are fo2 and fo6
which leads me to believe that Aiko has
like a set number of formulas and based
on how you answer their questions they
will like assign you a formula so it's
not exactly misspoke or one-of-a-kind
but it is like a customized sale like
it's like well you wanted this so the
formulas although similar are definitely
different but to me like the true X
Factor of this customized mascara is the
brush so I went back to the Aiko website
to see if they sold these brushes with
other mascaras that they already sell
and I found a few interesting things so
the ones that stick out to me as dupes
for the SN mascara are the lash alert
mascara and also the black magic mascara
I think the black magic mascara has my
exact same brush and it also has tubing
technology and shea butter the lash
alert mascara seems to use like a
slightly smaller brush but it also has
shea butter and tubing technology and I
feel like the vibe is the same like this
was supposed to be like a quick fix and
this one is a wake up and go so I feel
like you might not be able to get like
the exact combination of everything you
want in the mascaras they already have
but you could probably get pretty close
and pay like ten to fourteen dollars
less but that's just my thought so first
and foremost I think that both of these
mascaras are very good mascaras they
both lasted all day and they stood up
very well to our official tests and even
though my SN mascara wasn't waterproof
it doesn't seem to be to smudge I think
I was initially skeptical about the idea
customized mascara because when I hear
the words custom mascara I think like
how customized can you really make it
and I do think they ended up giving me a
good formula that addressed a lot of my
lash concerns but some of the things
that they say are like really impressive
about your customized formula are things
that a lot of their mascaras have like
tubing technology and shea butter and
even my favorite brush I do think that
their quiz could point you in the right
direction of like the products you
should be looking at but I don't know
that they should be charging you more
for like a customized preset formula I
do not know about the personalized
experience I feel like maybe it's more
fun to like go into the store and like
test out the brushes you know maybe pop
some bottles but as far as the online
experience goes I would say maybe get a
normal one and definitely don't get it
monogrammed thank you guys so much for
