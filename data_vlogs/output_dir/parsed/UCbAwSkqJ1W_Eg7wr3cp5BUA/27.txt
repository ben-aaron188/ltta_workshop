this is Sofia
hello friends and welcome to another
video this week I'm gonna be dressing
completely in outfits from the website
rubley if you haven't heard of prom week
it's a low cost online only clothing
store it seems kind of like forever 21
but much more mysterious
so I've previously worn a week's worth
of clothing from wish which is another
low cost website which was pretty much
as hit-or-miss as I expected it would be
and after that a lot of you guys
requested for me to try out other low
cost clothing sites like romwe I've
never tried wrongly before but I've seen
ads for it on Facebook a lot and it
seems like a pretty similar spec to wish
where the costs seemed very -
suspiciously low and the pictures look a
little too cute to be true so I'm gonna
be buying a week's worth of clothing and
I'm gonna try to keep the average price
per item at about $5
okay let's start shopping so I'm gonna
open up the Romney web site oh I just
miss felt it off the bat they've got
like a lot of like flashing things like
their banner is moving across the screen
very quickly I guess I don't really know
where to begin let's go into fall
fashion all right so let's sort this
from low to high ah these pants remind
me of the demon pants from wish they
seemed to be even more ripped than those
now it's a competition we have to see
which site has the better demon pant so
it looks like from this size chart I'm
definitely gonna be a large I don't see
any reviews anywhere so it's hard to say
just how demon II people think these are
alright so I'm gonna add these larges to
the bag and then let's look for a top
for this outfit oh I kind of like this
this is cute the title of it is the
friends print drop shoulder raw hem
hoodie they're a little bit more
abbreviated than the titles on wish I
feel like we're on wish would have been
friends print drop shoulder raw hem
bootie hooded sweatshirt friends
Chandler Monica Phoebe Phoebe Monica
Ross the way they styled their demon
pants was with a white alien crop top
but I feel like this would look good
with those black ripped pants alright so
I'm gonna add this friends mustard
hoodie in medium so that is my first
outfit my friend's hoodie and my black
demon
we're off to an auspicious beginning
let's get maybe one more item from the
like fall under 999 and then explore a
little bit more oh this is another
sweatshirt but I feel like I have to get
this I'm really into it actually this is
very much like a Simba moment here it's
just the cat is being held aloft it
looks like he was recently midwife to
buy a monkey named her pinky all right
so I'm gonna add this to the bag cuz we
have two and then we gotta find a bottom
for this and I kind of want to try these
camo print striped side leggings they
definitely give off that like army pants
and flip-flops vibe but they're leggings
of course ah these are one size which
actually you know goes together with the
fact that that sweatshirt was also only
one size so let's add it to bag and see
how it is okay so that is the second
outfit down so let's start exploring a
little bit more let's go for a dress how
bout dress is under $9.99 perfect so I
kind of want to get one of these that
are 399 this one looks pretty cute it's
a striped swing cami dress my only real
concern about this is if it's actually
secretly very short if I get a large
it's 33.9 inches we can just blur my but
in case it just sticks right out so with
this dress I feel like I would
definitely wanna put a belt on it so
let's see what the cheapest belts look
like this belt is super cute it is $5.99
and it's got this like western looking
buckle are there any sizes on this or
all right well let's going around my
waist so yeah hopefully if they've got a
few holes going hopefully this'll work
alright so I'm going to add that to the
cart as well and I'm gonna call that my
third outfit alright so I'm moving on to
outfit number 4 I'm gonna look for
something a little dressier so I'm gonna
look at their blouses and shirts this is
an early favorite right here this mock
neck lettuce hem glitter mesh top Wow
up close it looks incredibly scratchy
but I love this oh I loved her outfit
she looks so cute in it let's see what
the size chart says what size should I
get this must be a stretchy top because
these dimensions are quite small so I'm
gonna go with a large I feel like I
could see this going with like a black
skirt alright so let's take a look these
skirts are really all over the place
like there's this overall skirt we've
got this banana skirt I'm gonna come
back for the banana skirt I'm gonna
click on this
one it's called the black scalloped hem
a line skirt it looks like it might be
short though but I feel like that would
go with like the vibe you know I'd wear
that top and then a black bra underneath
and then this skirt and like tights and
we'd go out you haven't been out
probably since like last New Year's no
we didn't go out last New Year's yep
there you go and that is outfit number
five all right so we've got two outfits
left I feel like we have to go back to
that banana skirt it's just calling to
me Tyler I want it I want it you don't
even know what it looks like yet the
interesting thing about this skirt is it
so like graphic I feel like you could
pair it with like a black top and it
would almost be like cool to be honest
this turtleneck slim fit t-shirt could
go really well do you support me Tyler
can you see it I'm wearing a black
turtleneck and a banana skirt might as
well all right so I'm gonna add this
large to my bag we're just gonna go with
it so that's my sixth outfit and we just
have one outfit left to go I've been
seeing a lot of alien head tops as I've
been shopping so I'm gonna search for
aliens I would love for one of these
alien things to have it embroidered on
ah is this sewn on so this is a great
ident alien patch t-shirt
show me the money shot I would say
that's embroidered on so I'm gonna get
this for sure okay so I think with that
it's look at how much jeans are I
haven't seen any jeans really but that's
maybe because they're all sort of like
above the $10 mark yeah looks like
they're gonna be all a little bit more
expensive I could maybe swing this jean
skirt in this I would say I'm either uh
probably a large or an extra-large
I feel like we should go extra-large
just in case so that is outfit number
seven I did get a couple of like more
summery outfits so I'm just gonna grab
like a universal bonus jacket of some
type these jackets are all like
windbreakers what's happening here this
jacket I think is actually really kind
of cute okay so I'm gonna get this dual
pocket drop shoulder jacket which is a
little bit more expensive than kind of
the price point we've been going for
we're just gonna add this to the bag and
it's just a bonus item all right so I
think that's all my stuff so our
complete total
is 84 87 it says that the retail price
from which they have discounted is two
hundred and seventy two dollars and 86
cents I'm not sure where they're getting
that from and it looks like I've also
gotten 169 wrong loop points okay so my
order has been placed I paid for Express
shipping so I'm hoping that it gets here
in between three to five days that would
be awesome and a big change from wish
so we'll see what arrives when it
arrives all right so it's been a couple
of months since we ordered our romwe
items and I think everything is finally
here and by everything I mean everything
except for the belt which didn't arrive
and then I was informed that it would
never arrive so I was refunded for the
belt one thing to note is that I think I
checked three to five day shipping and
paid for that and everything took at
least a month to arrive another little
mishap is that after reviewing the
footage and seeing everything that came
I realized that I only ordered six
outfits instead of seven so for day
seven of this week I'm basically gonna
wear like my favorite stuff with our
bonus jacket coming in handy and we'll
see you know what's good out of this
haul so for my first romwe outfit I
donned my mustard yellow friend's
sweatshirt and my cousin of demon pant
okay these ripped leggings although
they're more like strategically cut
leggings I feel like I should be selling
frosted flakes right about now those
pants are greeted the sweatshirt is made
of more of like a terry cloth material
than a fleece material so it's a little
bit of a lighter layer than one might
expect I would not recommend this to
anyone who lives anywhere colder than
Southern California besides that I
didn't really have any other issues with
a friend's sweatshirt I like the mustard
color and it feels pretty nice but the
leggings I had a few more issues with
well you see your underwear oh my god
those these are transparent Sofia oh
really yeah and they also ride down as
you walk you see me waddling a lot of
these pants yeah I'm trying to keep them
from riding down I
would not wear this to any type of
stretching yoga or dance activity
because I feel like you just be like
hiking it up the entire time I may have
ripped the pants a little bit just then
in the front yeah I like these a little
bit better than the wish demon pants
though because those were like almost
like paper feeling and these at least
are like super super super thin leggings
they're like a gremlin pant so for my
second outfit of the week I went for my
banana skirt and black long-sleeved
turtleneck banana una oh my god
I think the black turtleneck was pretty
much exactly as I expected it to be
it feels pretty normal and the
turtleneck itself is quite long is that
full extension on the turtleneck I think
it could even go more the banana skirt I
had such high hopes for but alas it did
not really live up to expectations it's
kind of short so I'm kind of like
getting worried that my buttocks are
going to be showing at any moment I
think my least favorite things about the
skirt were the waistband which is just
sort of like a flat piece of elastic
that around my waist kept rolling up so
I keep having to like try and flatten it
out and also this little satin like
lining inside it's just like a straight
down satin tube I was just readjusting
the satin lining and I tore it I think
that I could definitely wear this black
turtleneck again but the banana skirt
I'm not so sure so I'm giving the banana
skirt outfit six bananas out of ten are
all of the outfits now on the banana
scale yes so my third outfit was this
black and white striped dress in general
I think that this dress looks like what
I thought it was going to look like but
the material is definitely different
than what I thought it would be it's
sort of nylon feeling it's not thick or
like taut enough to be swimsuit material
it's more like long underwear material
really a kite
besides the material I actually liked
the way this dress fit I think I got the
right size and I think with a belt it
was like a pretty decent dress
it's stretchy the only big like red flag
for this dress was the bag that it came
in all the other romwe items came in
like this type of bag where it didn't
really say like a brand on the front but
this dress came in this bag that says
she and she in or Shane I'm not sure
exactly how to pronounce it he's like a
sort of comparable website to Romney
it's kind of in the conversation when
you say like the sock full wish Bromley
Shay in so I don't know if there's just
secretly all the same company so
although this dress was fine I think it
may have come from Cheyenne was that you
being a kite you're gonna fall on your
face so my day for outfit was my white
cat sweatshirt and my camo print
leggings as with a lot of the other
outfits I liked the top more than I
liked the bottom this like sweatshirt
material is pretty thin but it is soft
and it doesn't feel crazy or fit crazy
the only real issue I had with the top
was a little bit of fraying around the
neck and also the fact that like the
print on graphic is easily wrinkled I
did steam the crap out of this plastic
design but it looks like actually it's
dried pretty unwrinkled the leggings I
have a few qualms with I don't think
that they're like ridiculously different
from how they looked in the picture but
I don't find them to be very flattering
on my body especially around my
midsection I feel like these leggings
both showed off my lumps
but also didn't like hug my horse
there's also a very strange small tag
right in my crack ooh when I sat down I
was like so I'm gonna cut that off when
I get home I could definitely see myself
wearing this top again but the pants I
don't think so
I saw soft wearing army pants and
Birkenstocks so I didn't get army pants
or Birkenstocks so for my day 5 outfit I
wore my sparkly see-through top and my
black skirt going out too
in the middle of day scenic parking lots
I actually really liked the skirt my
only real problem with it is that it's
really short so I feel good wearing it
with tights but without tights it might
be sort of a scandalous situation the
material is definitely a little bit thin
and it's not like super hugging my body
but I think that it actually fits pretty
well besides that I think the top is
pretty stretchy as I predicted but it is
a little bit more see-through than I
thought it would be I love it we bought
this outfit to like go out maybe for you
know our once in the Blue Moon excursion
but instead we're just at a mall in the
middle of the day it is kind of like
midnight at noon you know like Christmas
in July the only sad thing is that there
is a hole right here so I'm not sure
that it's like a very durable top if it
already has a hole in it although I
haven't like caused any more holes yet I
feel like I probably could with any type
of snaggly nail I think that this was
like the closest to a full outfit that I
might actually wear again and unlike
some of the other outfits I actually
ended up liking the bottom more than the
top now this is my kind of going
by going out I mean staying inside of a
pool so for my second-to-last outfits I
whipped out my alien shirt and denim
skirt I think that this shirt is like
one of my favorite items so far it does
feel actually really soft here feel it
mmm yeah that's a nice shirt so my only
real complaint about this top is the
fact that like the alien guy is a little
bit free yeah you lose stitches in there
he's a sad alien and I think that frayed
edges are actually a common theme
throughout some of these tops the skirt
I was pleasantly surprised by it
actually feels like thin but real denim
it fits me pretty well and my only real
issue with it like wearing wise is that
it rides up if you walk with too long of
a stride there's also a little bit of a
scent to it my skirt smells suspiciously
like a swimming pool when I put it on I
was like it's concentrated around the
waistband of the skirt oh that is
chlorine maybe they kind of like forgot
to give this skirt its last rinse before
sending it off but other than that I
actually think that I might wear both of
these things again why would honestly
give this outfit like eight out of ten
bananas and finally for my day seven
outfit I went for some Greatest Hits
plus bonus jacket so the jacket was the
most expensive thing that we got and
keeping that in mind I'm not sure that
it lived up to that price hike the
jacket itself looks pretty much like how
I thought it would look from the photos
but it's very thin you know how hot like
North Face they'll be like suitable in
like 20 degree weather yes suitable in
ten degree weather this is like suitable
only at seventy-five degrees if you
bought this hoping for a windbreaker or
a cargo jacket I think you'd be
disappointed there's not enough fabric
that I would really
enough fabric to grab it and I do think
it looks kind of cute so as just like a
fashion layer I think it works but it is
also very prone to wrinkles so you do
have to like continuously steam it
honestly my steamer gets like not that
much work until we do one of these
internet haul videos and then it's like
and then it's like our most prized
possession we're steamers i steam now
alright so that was my week of romwe
outfits from this haul I think that I
learned that tops are decently safe from
romwe but bottoms are kind of a
crapshoot leggings I would say
absolutely not
skirts I would say maybe and dresses I
would say are they from Shion in terms
of the buying experience
Romney's website is definitely more
legit looking than wishes and it
definitely feels more like it's a single
retailer rather than a hodgepodge of a
market place the only thing I found
really odd about the website was the
about Us page it's like they tried to
write a poem and just missed serving the
world the last scene of American Beauty
is a red plastic bag flying with the
wind up and down which is similar to the
flying feather in the beginning of
Forrest Gump the similar images
portrayed different aspects of baby
boomers everyone's got their own way
through all twists and turns in life
that is actually a prominently featured
part of their about Us page maybe they
were referring to the plastic bags in
which they sent me my clothes and maybe
this is just like a poetic way to
explain the fact that they sometimes use
chien bags
