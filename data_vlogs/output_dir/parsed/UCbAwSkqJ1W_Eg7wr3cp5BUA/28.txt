hello friends and welcome to another
video this week we're gonna be testing
out four different
customized style boxes and seeing how
well each of them recommend outfits to
me now I see subscription boxes
particularly style subscription boxes
advertised all the time online and one
of their most consistent selling points
is that you're gonna save a lot of time
shopping because they're gonna send you
stuff you're gonna love and you're never
gonna have to go to the store yourself
again basically it seems like you tend
to either take some type of
personalization quiz or communicate with
a virtual stylist in some way and then
bada-bing bada-boom five to seven
business days later you got a box with
some clothes in it that you're supposed
to like so I want to compare four of
these style boxes that I've seen before
against each other so the four boxes are
going to be stitch fix on the tote
wantable and trunk club so I'm gonna be
ordering all four boxes today and when
they arrive I'm gonna see what I got if
it was worth it and if I like it okay
let's get started so about a year ago
when I made my very first facebook ad
haul video stitch fix was one of my
facebook ads on my feed so I've ordered
a style box from them before but I
didn't really get to like go into detail
with it in the video because it was like
part of a bigger whole but I've dabbled
alright so it says basically how it
works is that you fill out a style
profile request a fix and then you get
to keep what you want so you have to
remember to send the things that you
don't want back to them which is the
real rub because that's hard to remember
to be honest so their style profile quiz
has 51 questions and it took me about 20
minutes to fill out it's got five
different sections and they start with a
section about your sizes and proportions
I would say my arms are pretty long my
wingspan is identical to that of a
turkey vulture so I would say long arms
yes the second section is about - the
shape of clothes you prefer they call it
pitch slash cut I guess sometimes I'll
flaunt my arms back I'll say flaunt only
for special occasions I don't like to
wear for special bra
I like to wear the same bras for years
on end I do wash them sometimes the
third section of questions is about
style in which they show you a bunch of
clothing layouts and you basically say
if you like or don't like them okay I
think this category is closest to my
style I see a decent amount of black and
some boots so I'm gonna say I love that
one then they ask you how much you'd
like to spend on the clothes and then
some last minute personal information
like your occupation and your Instagram
handle great job Sofia you finished your
style quiz thank you I feel very
accomplished so I've scheduled my fix
it's gonna arrive on February 10th and
then we're gonna open it up and see
what's inside
all right so the second style box we're
gonna do is 'la tote I have never tried
any of these other style boxes besides
stitch fix before but I think with
litotes you rent the clothes as in they
like send them to you you wear them and
then you send it back but I think you
can also still buy the stuff if you
really like it and once you've returned
your tote they'll send you your next one
so it's kind of like old-school Netflix
all right so let's build my style
profile so litotes quiz was a little bit
shorter it had 15 questions and it took
me about eight minutes to fill out the
first set of questions were like
multiple-choice image questions about
which styles of different types of
clothing I like to capes I don't have
any capes but I would definitely wear a
cape if the occasion called for it or
even if the occasion didn't call for it
I feel like if you give me a cape
I will opt for cape yes beyond that they
ask you what brands you like and your
sizes as well as your zip code
presumably to account for your weather I
was at it I thought it was gonna like
show me my forecast for some reason I
think they've just identified that it's
a warm place and then at the end you
pick your monthly plan all of which are
more expensive than Netflix one of the
features of the tote is that you can go
in and like swap out some of the items
if you want to but I want to see what
they've recommended to me based off of
that quiz so I'm just gonna leave it as
is but just know that you could swap
stuff out if you wanted to all right so
our third style box is wantable
I have also never tried wantable but I
think it's similar to stitch
in that you take a quiz and then they
send you a box of personalized clothes
and you keep what you want and Mail back
the rest oh wow they have a progress bar
at the bottom this seems like a long
quiz the first section asked me high
level questions about my style like
level of formal miss size shape I think
I'm more of a pair not so much up top a
decent amount of junk in the trunk
price preference is there someone who
prefers to buy expensive stuff and then
the second section basically showed me
images of clothes and asked me if I
liked or didn't like them I do like knee
length and midi-length
skirts but someone should tell them that
those two skirts are exactly the same
length which type of scarves would you
like to receive I say infinity or bust
man get me an infinity scarf or give me
nothing this was a very long section all
right I think we're done with the quiz
finally they say we have a style edit
just for you you will only receive
products that you love or like and I
will not receive products that I dislike
aka bracelets and sweaters I have
nothing against bracelets and sweaters I
just feel like I don't wear them that
much all right so I'm gonna sign up now
and order my my box tote I don't know
they all call them different things
alright so let's move on to our last
style box which is trunk club which I'm
pretty sure is a similar service to
wantable and stitch fix but it's owned
by Nordstrom alright let's get started
so the trunk Club quiz had 34 questions
and took me about 10 minutes to fill out
the first section was a series of images
of outfit flat leis that I had to choose
if I liked or didn't like ooh I would
wear that I like that Bordeaux colored
moto jacket and then they moved into
more general questions like which colors
I don't like and which styles of clothes
I do like which is your preferred Jean
rise high rise baby meet me at the navel
meet me at the navel yes and then they
also asked me how much I typically spend
on clothes where I usually shop my sizes
and my age what is this trunk for it's
mostly for like fun and
casual life does that make sense all
right so I'm gonna share these details
with my stylist and I've got one they've
assigned me one all right I'm just gonna
say hi Emily can't wait to get my first
trunk
I hope she's real and I hope she text me
back it would be sad to be ghosted by
the stylist that I'm paying anyway so
that is style box number four so next
time you see me I will have all of my
four style boxes and we'll see what's
inside and try it all on see you in the
future all right so it's a few weeks
later and I finally have all of my style
boxes here we're gonna start off with
this one that I have right here which is
the wantable box let's see how many
things they gave us and what they are
what is this it's kind of like a satin
red tank top with some scraps I've also
got this oh it's an infinity scarf next
up we have this blue top I take a blue
lacy top and then we've got this navy
blue like tunic top they gave me some
sort of dark wash skinny jeans
here's our first taste of black it's
kind of like a suede look moto jacket I
really like that and then the last item
is this dark wash distressed pair of
skinny jeans which looks pretty up my
alley I think we almost went from like
things that were least up my alley to
most up my alley as we went through the
box so wantable sent me seven items with
an average price of $65 per item and
they give you five days from when you
receive the box to send back the stuff
you don't like or else be charged for
the whole thing
there was one mistake on the item sheet
that I noticed they say they gave me a
crossbody burgundy bag for 60 bucks but
instead I have this green fringed scarf
well we'll have to talk to them about
that out of the seven items I think I
want to keep two of them the faux suede
black moto jacket which I really really
liked it's kind of stretchy
I think it's faux suede I don't think
it's real suede uh based on the price
and the also faux suede Green infinity
scarf with fringes on it I don't know
where all my scarves went I think when I
moved to Southern California I put them
somewhere and they're gone so I want to
restart my scarf collection I think a
lot of the rest of the items were kind
of like
but no cigar the genes in general were
just sort of like genes that were
similar to genes I already have so I
didn't feel like keeping them and as for
the tops and the dress they were cute
and sort of my style in some ways but
mostly my problem with them was like fit
and how they fell both of the tank tops
just had a semi looseness to them and
ended at a weird place it's just sort of
like right at the hips I have a shorter
torso and longer legs so like maybe
that's what's throwing it off maybe
they're just looking at my height and
kind of like dividing it in half and
with the dress I just never seem to have
any luck with that shapeless shift style
because I'm pear-shaped
so it always ends up cupping my butt so
like you don't have that cool like loose
like casual look it's a shift and then
on the bottom it's a badonk
so overall I would say that wantable did
an okay job recommending new things so
next up is our little box shall we see
what's inside our tote I mean it's a box
but we can call it a tote alright so the
first item is blue and stripey it looks
like it's a wrap cardigan next up we've
kind of got a gray like workout tank top
followed by this Nike tank top another
workout item interesting and then we've
got this black dress oh just kidding
it's a jumpsuit
it's a black jumpsuit they also threw in
a couple of jewelry pieces which are
super cute actually glitz glam bling and
then we've got this Paisley dress ooh
maxi dress and then the last item is
this which is a scarf it's not an
infinity scarf but it's a scarf which is
okay so litotes sent me eight items with
an average price of 37 dollars per item
but keep in mind that these are not new
items we don't have to buy anything but
you can if you want to just keep in mind
that you are still paying a monthly
rental fee no matter what out of eight
items that they sent me I really really
love this black jumpsuit and I think I'm
gonna keep it it is a little more formal
then I usually go but like I feel like
if I were invited somewhere I could wear
this I don't usually get invited places
but I could go in the
emphasis on if if so I was really
impressed by the formal wear in this box
being the jumpsuit and the maxi dress
and the jewelry but the other stuff was
kind of like random also I wasn't that
psyched about getting workout gear in a
rental box I feel like in general I
wouldn't want to rent my workout clothes
just for everyone else's sake I have
quite a few tank tops that I work out
and already and none of them smell very
good but of course you can if you decide
to do this
customize your tote more than I did so
you could sub some of the items out
before they get to you alright so next
up is my stitch fix box teddy boom so
item number one is this black floral
tank top that's not what I thought it
would be when I saw it folded up and
then we've got this stripey elbow patch
sleeve sweater and then this sort of
like move open back top this oatmeal
colored cardigan cardigan
it's a cardigan and then these blue
jeans looks like sort of light to medium
washed skinny jeans so stitch fix sent
me five items with an average price of
fifty dollars per item and basically I
have three days to send it back I think
I can delay it to five days but after
that belt charge yeah so from this box I
would say that most of the items fit
pretty well except for the placement of
the elbow patches on the elbow patch
sweater
oh wow they're way off this is like a
tricep patch so it doesn't seem like
they took the turkey vulture very
seriously and overall I thought the
items were mostly cute but not really me
out of five things the only thing I
would really consider keeping would be
this mova long-sleeve top with like a
little bit of an open upper back I
actually think I said that I don't like
to show off my back which I don't
usually but this open back is not like
to to open so I don't really mind it and
in general I love long sleeves and I
like how soft it is feel me yeah the
jeans weren't bad but they just weren't
really anything new and I had the same
cut problem with the tank top that I did
with the tank tops in the wantable
like it just hits me like right at sort
of the widest part of my hip they can't
account for your torso soft it's just
you're lopsided Scandinavia legs I'm too
skanky for them I don't think you're
ready for this candy I think I'm just a
little bit confused where like my style
or like my answers to the quiz comes in
with this box and something that stitch
fix had that none of the other companies
had was access to my Instagram now to be
fair I do sometimes Instagram random
things for videos so maybe it wasn't
that helpful in terms of like getting my
true personal style but I don't think
these items reflect my Instagram either
unless they thought I would like a
lengthy oatmeal cardigan because of this
and finally trunk club there seemed to
be a lot of items in here so I think we
should just get crack-a-lackin' and open
it up holy carp Batman oh let's go it's
opening this way it's like pirate
treasure alright let's open the shoes
first how about ooh all right these look
like black over-the-knee boots oh and
these are like gray sneakers so this
looks like a black and white striped top
and this is like a rose graphic crop top
and then we've got these kind of shiny
jeans this grey choker dress these light
wash jeans and also these black jeans a
see-through long sleeve top a velvet
moto jacket a romper and a green body
con midi dress alright I'm a little
sweaty
after opening all those things up Emily
really did a number on this huh she was
just like have it all
so Trump clubs sent 12 items with an
average price of $99 per item but the
three pairs of jeans do hike up the
average price a lot so if you don't take
those into account the average price is
$70 per item they also give you five
days to try everything on and return it
before they charge you but if you want
to return something after you get
charged you can either drop them off at
Nordstrom or just send them back
yourself so you're not like super stuck
with it if you accidentally forget to
send it back I think that the styling of
this box was definitely the closest to
my personal style out of all of the
boxes I tried I think Emily the stylist
a really good job of picking things that
were both in my style arena but also a
little bit outside of the box which I
appreciate it so out of 12 items I think
I'm gonna keep four of them
these stripy long-sleeve top with an
asymmetric hem it's kind of like lady
beetlejuice the knit choker dress I
don't go out like dancing a lot to the
club to the cub to the club but I kind
of want to keep it because I feel good
in it the see-through top I like the
ruffle are right around the hand and
also that you can barely see my hands
and the gray sneakers athleisure it's
what they say to me athleisure I might
have kept the moto jacket but I had
literally just gotten a moto jacket from
wantable
and that one was cheaper I also really
liked the light wash jeans but the jeans
in general were really pricey so I had
to pass on them in fact I think the only
thing I didn't really like about this
box was that the genes were sneakily
expensive alright so that was my style
box haul I don't think that I saved any
time by doing this just because of the
amount of like returning things you have
to do and also keeping track of time
but I think in terms of giving me
clothes I would like Trump club is the
only one that really nailed it I think
that the litotes and stitch fix boxes
were the most random though I will say
that the stitch fix box that I got a
year ago was better so maybe it was just
an off box wantable was kinda close ish
but doubling back to their scarf bag
mistake they did give me the price
difference back so at least they fixed
that so after all this I'm not sure that
I would get another style box just
because I feel like it encourages
lukewarm buying because the styling fee
applies towards the purchase of one item
and the stuffs already in your house you
might be inclined to keep something that
you think is okay or you might wear even
if you would never like actually go out
and buy it for yourself so I'm not sure
that this is actually a better use of
money or time than actual shopping but
if I were to do one again I think I
would go with Trump slub oh and for the
record
Emily didn't ghost me she emailed me
back and told me that she wasn't gonna
send me a scarf because I lived in LA
and it was too hot for one so I think
she likes me thank you guys so much for
