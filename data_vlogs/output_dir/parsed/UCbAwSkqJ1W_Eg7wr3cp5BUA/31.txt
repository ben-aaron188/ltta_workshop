nope I'm not sure hello friends and
welcome to another video today I'm gonna
be testing out questionable beauty hacks
from Facebook videos so recently I was
scrolling on my Facebook feed and I came
across this video it was a DIY makeup
hack video in which the hacker cut up
fake eyelashes and dumped them into
clear eyebrow gel and that was it that
was the hack much to the ire of the
commenters below this led me down a
rabbit hole of more of these Facebook
Beauty hack videos of which many seem to
share the theme of why and is that even
a hack it seems like they often just do
random things just to have a sensational
thumbnail or title so it's not really
the kind of clickbait where they lie to
you because they usually show you what's
in the thumbnail within the video with
some exceptions but often times they
seem to just invent something ridiculous
just to get a reaction and they almost
never talk in the videos so they don't
really have to explain themselves to be
fair it can be kind of entertaining like
hey you've got a fork on your face how
about that but I wouldn't really call
them hacks that said maybe I've got it
all wrong maybe these hacks aren't
ridiculous and they're actually very
helpful so we're gonna put them to the
test today and find out okay so first up
is this pretty mysterious hack so this
particular video was posted by a
Facebook page called brush and the
caption says I need to try these a
little bit below that they do credit
this girl Luisa Simona's Instagram but
it doesn't seem like they tried these
before they shared them with the world
so basically they put some toothpaste
and then some baking soda in a cup and
they mix it together oh and then
straight away there was no before
picture of the chin Luisa is just
brushing the toothpaste on her chin I
don't know what her motivation is I mean
we can watch it with the sound on just
to be sure that
Lisa's not speaking to us no it's just
just sort of jazzy love making music but
she does make sure to put up some fish
emojis just you know she's making a fish
face then she wipes it off and we see
her chin and then after that it just
goes straight into a different hack so
that's about all the context we have so
I say let's test this thing okay so she
starts off by just pouring the
toothpaste in there's no quantities that
she gives she just sort of puts it in
it's a pretty artful swirl if I do say
so myself and then after that she puts
in what looks like one teaspoon of
baking soda oh I spilled it I spilt it
this smells really good though maybe
it's for bad breath on your face so how
she applies it is she just sort of takes
someone her toothbrush and then puts it
straight on the chin oh it's cold it
just missed completely oh wow that is
pungent and powerful on the chin she
does sort of brush it around oh that
hurts
I feel hacked Lucy if Louisa herself has
anything to say about this ah this must
be it it is supposed to remove
blackheads it's supposed to remove
blackheads don't leave it on well I've
left it on it's too late now we can't go
back alright so I think I should
probably take it off now because I've
left it on for at least five minutes oh
boy oh oh wow I was coming off it hurts
more I don't know that my chin looks
like there's less blackheads on it but
it does look a little bit red and raw so
Louisa did have a little bit more
instructions but brush just chose to
like completely not include those though
the comments do say a couple of helpful
things do not do the first one with
whitening toothpaste it will burn its
are whitening yes damn it Louisa alright
well that's our first hack based on the
pain and the lack of instructions
I wouldn't recommend this one shall we
continue so this next hack was the sort
of og hack that started off this whole
process this is the clear eye brow gel
this video was posted by a page called
eyeliner addict and yeah people in the
comments are just really not having
like Trisha for example says so if I
shave my legs or vag I can just glue it
on my face to which I say Trisha do you
the thing is as the girl applies the gel
to her eyebrows her eyebrows don't look
bad at the end but I'm just really
unconvinced that it has anything to do
with the little hairs that are in the
gel but who knows so let me wipe my
eyebrows off and put some eyelashes on
them all right so it looks like her
first step is just chopping off bits of
these fake eyelashes
does she chop them all up she must right
this is just not enough hair there's
just this is too slow okay
this is making your life easier I kind
of feel like I don't have as many as
they did they only really showed like
one tray of these little eyelashes but I
feel like theirs was much hairier it
looks like a really bad sneeze is that
how many nose hairs come out when you
sneeze no comment so we have the exact
same eyebrow gel that they showed in
their video they have some type of extra
dropper though to get it out of there so
I'm gonna pop open the top and I'm gonna
stick this syringe in none of these
steps were included in the hack by the
way all right and then I'm gonna syringe
the clear gel into our little pot oh
yeah that looks good all right well I
think it's time to mix our gel up and
put it on my eyebrows the thing is like
maybe if you have sparse eyebrows you
want to fill them in with things that
look legitimately like hair but I just
don't think that these really look like
eyebrow hairs they're curly and wiry and
pubie I know that there's hairs on my
brush but I don't think that they're
coming off onto my eyebrow I will admit
that my eyebrows are not like the most
sparse but at least they match the color
of the eyelashes because I feel like if
you had lighter eyebrows this might look
ridiculous all right so I think I've
done both brows I don't think that they
look like particularly bad you can't
even really see the little hairs at all
and if you can they're just kind of like
sticking out awkwardly it's possible
that they may have thought this was a
good hack but I also think that they may
have just thought it looked kind of
gross and thought that they could get a
bunch of Facebook comments about it and
they were right okay so this next hack
is for eyeshadow and I'm gonna be honest
I feel
like it might work but when I saw this I
was just like why so this is a video
posted by this page called five minute
crafts its caption is top secret beauty
hacks for the perfect image winky face
you know what I'm talking about the
perfect image alright so right in the
beginning this person has covered her
face and pads that is uh not part of any
of the hacks I don't think that she's
just sort of done that too artistically
show you that pads are gonna be involved
in this video so basically this woman is
putting on eye shadow she's getting
fallout it's terrible
it's almost like a setup like an
old-school infomercial it's like do you
have a really hard time opening milk and
then now they're gonna show you the
solution which is to just put a straw in
the side like joey tribianni my favorite
is that she looks to the side sneakily
before she pulls the pad out and then
she cuts it up into pieces and sticks
the pieces under her eyes I understand
the idea of like putting something
underneath your eyes to catch fallout
but does it have to be a pad the people
in the comments don't seem to be loving
it is no one gonna mention that pads are
way too expensive to be using on your
face everyday the sticky adhesive that's
supposed to adhere to panties should
never go on your face listen Angie you
seem like a sensible person that has no
place in Facebook hack videos so um
let's try this shall we alright so I'm
gonna cut my pad as she does I think my
pads a little bit thicker than hers then
I'm gonna take the adhesive off and then
stick this on the face it's a good look
I'm not sure about her pads but my pads
on my face right now only has adhesive
like right in the middle of it so I
actually feel like fallout could still
get underneath there all right I'm going
into some more vibrant colors just to
make sure we could really test the
fallout caching capabilities I don't
really know what type of eye shadow look
I'm going for right here I'm just -
putting colors on my face all right
ready
I'm gonna take them off oh I do think
that they caught some of the fallout cuz
you can see that there's a little eye
shadow specks sort of right there so it
did catch some of it - this little spot
right here but as people in the comments
said the expense of using pads under
your eyes and also the fact that you
have a pad adhesive on your under eye
skin every day makes us a pretty
like not feasible hack all right so this
next hack is a foundation application
hack of which I feel like there were a
lot in the last year and a half or so
alright so this video is from a page
called beauty hacks and their caption is
items at home that will save your makeup
routine and the item they propose will
save your foundation is a balloon my
biggest gripe with this hack is how
they've cut it together it seems like it
doesn't work very well to begin with and
then it cuts to her foundation being
completely blended so it makes me feel
like she blended out her makeup with
something else in between okay I mean
let's try it I'm gonna inflate this now
yes this is a tough balloon let me
stretch this out a little bit alright
there we go
hahah a Beauty Blender alright ready it
makes a fun sound when it hits my face
alright clear first problem besides the
fact that the foundation isn't really
soaking in which is pretty much exactly
what happened in the video is that this
balloon tip is round and I can't really
get in any crevice of my face but this
is fun I could just do this for a while
oh that's a good idea
the balloon is more malleable than I had
expected
alright there seems to be a couple
crevices that we just can't reach so I
don't think that her foundation was
completely blended out by a balloon but
I would recommend putting a balloon on
her face because it's fun I wouldn't
call it a beauty hack but it would be
what I would call a fun evening so this
next hack is an example of what I'd call
the hack gone too far this video is
called 9 hacks for perfect cat eyes and
this girl basically just takes any item
she can find with a straight edge and
puts it next to her I which seems to be
okay when it's like tape are like a
playing card she then goes on to paint
scissors with eyeliner and put them next
to her ah the interesting things about
these comments are that a lot of people
are criticizing her eyeliner which I
actually don't find to be the problem
there are not enough people in these
comments being like please don't put
next to your eye anyway with that let's
try it which end does it look like she's
using I think it's a dis edge yeah it's
a long pointy one so I think in spirit
this hack is pretty good that just
freaked me out yeah it just afraid to me
that this hack is similar to like an
eyeliner stamp where she actually paints
the eyeliner on the little edge and then
stamps it stamps it on her eye to which
I would say use anything else but this
this is probably one of the Dumber
things we've done on this channel
alright ready I'm not ready I'm nervous
mom whoa that wasn't even good it didn't
come out very well which is a shame
because I put my eyeball on the line I
think I'm gonna have to try it again and
maybe try and paint more of the scissor
blade thing is my scissor has a flat end
right here and so does hers it's not
even like a point yeah I don't think
that looks very good I'm just gonna do
the other side just for good measure
well I mean that's better but it's still
terrible yeah I wouldn't recommend this
hack I don't think either eye is ideal
and also putting a scissor next to your
eye is not ideal so I would say in
general don't do this one okay so this
next hack is also from the Facebook page
brush and it is called for emergency
makeup hacks everyone needs to know so
this one is like a few hacks in in this
video and it's basically supposed to be
emergency lipstick they put Elmer's glue
and food coloring into a bowl mix it
together then apply it to their lips and
let it sit for 10 minutes and then peel
it off so I think basically the idea is
that I would be staining my lips which
may work but I think my biggest issue
with it is just like why would I have
these things with me in a makeup
emergency I feel like if you're you're
in a pinch and you've got 10 minutes to
spare try and see where the nearest CBS
is I think that's number one on the list
alright and now let's put it on my lips
all right let me try and get a good coat
of this on there I'm trying to get some
butthole coverage as well I know I feel
like a Barbie doll so yeah I'm gonna
hang around for 10 minutes and then
we're gonna peel it off alright so it's
been 10 minutes
I can't really talk but it's really
solidified and I think I hopefully I'm
ready to peel it off
oh yeah that's a pretty good peel very
snake skinny and I do think my lips look
pretty pink actually I do have a little
bit of like extra glue kind of like in
the inner rim but whole area but besides
that I think that the stain did work I
just don't think that this is what one
would or should do when presented with a
makeup emergency it doesn't seem like a
good use of time or glue all right so
we've made it this far this is our very
last hack this is a video from eyeliner
addict and the caption is take your
makeup off with shaving cream basically
this girl rubs shaving cream all over
her face and you know it sort of tries
to show us that it's taking her makeup
off then she says but be careful around
your eyes and then it cuts ahead to the
eye makeup already being removed so I
suspect that this hack doesn't really
work and they're just living off the
cachet that like shaving creams a weird
quirky thing to put on your face so with
that let's try and take our makeup off
nope I'm not sure I put too much on I
need help all right just give me one
second I'm just gonna run to the
bathroom and get rid of this extra stuff
so she basically just takes the cotton
round and just swipes it down like this
I mean it looks like there's some makeup
that came off mostly I feel like I just
took off the shaving cream you know I'm
gonna need a lot of cotton rounds for
this use all of your Konrad's
every time you take off your makeup see
I just don't see how this is helping
anyone I think that the shaving cream is
a little bit itchy and it's also like
weirdly drying all right so it seems
like we've reached the eyes she
completely skipped this portion so um I
guess just straight to the eye is that
working at all I actually do think it's
taking some of my eyeshadow off but I'm
not convinced it's doing anything for
the eyeliner I think it's just sort of
smudging it around I would be at this
for like a good 30 minutes before I was
actually makeup free so I don't think I
would call this a hack and the fact that
this is the only hack in this video is
worse I think it's not like a filler
hack it's not like oh we need fives like
throwing in there there like this
deserves a video do you think we could
cut a head and then
were ya just turn all the cameras off
I'll take my makeup off of the makeup
wipe and then we'll reroll okay so those
were my facebook beauty hacks out of all
of these hacks there were definitely a
couple that worked to a certain extent
but I would also say that none of them
prioritized ease convenience or
common-sense over getting views shares
and comments on their videos to be fair
there are weird beauty hacks all over
the internet but on other platforms like
blog posts and YouTube videos the
Creator has to at least try to explain
why they think the hack is helpful but
in these videos they're more like this
is a ridiculous seeming method we're not
going to explain to you why this is
happening and we're gonna bet on the
fact that you're probably not gonna try
it and call us out on it now I
understand the plight of posting videos
to Facebook they're basically trying to
get people to stop scrolling on their
feed and watch a video they didn't ask
for so these videos basically need to be
as crazy as possible to stand out which
explains why these videos are pretty fun
to watch and sort of out of the box but
good beauty hacks they are not thank you
