hello friends and welcome to another
video today we're gonna be trying out
another ugly clothing item and this one
I can't quite wrap my head around so in
this series we've previously worn the
Teva uggs the clear nilaam jeans
the ASOS band ruffle t-shirt the clear
plastic pants the hairy chest swimsuit
and the slender man jacket but a couple
of weeks ago I found this sweater I'm
gonna call it a sweater which apparently
is a giant eight foot long
280 dollar tube of wool which is hand
knitted in Bulgaria by a designer named
Duke Jana who seems to make a lot of
hand knitted wonders many of which I
would like to try but today we're
focusing on the sweater I'm just gonna
keep saying the word sweater and
eventually it'll become a sweater her
usual though the Internet has been
somewhat mystified by this item Bazaar
mega scarf that makes women look like a
giant sock goes on sale for 210 pounds
it's so ridiculous it looks photoshopped
need to stay warm this winter just wear
this giant embody scarf if anybody
actually buys this they need therapy and
not the retail kind for reading all
those headlines I guess most of the
press thinks that this thing is a scarf
so maybe it's not a sweater either way
we have it here now and we're gonna wear
it all day let's bring it out shall we
so this is it I don't know how much can
be seen let me just try and show you
guys how much there really is it looks
like the shedded skin of an anaconda
like it looks like a really large sock
puppet has molted I don't really know
what to say other than this doesn't seem
like an item of clothing I understand
obviously that you go inside the hole
right but where where do you come out
upon further inspection I think I'm just
more confused it kind of feels like a
biological plushy like a learning tool
for children in
like you dress up as poop and you walk
through the large intestine I think that
the only way to get more answers from
this thing is to enter it so let's go
put it on shall we oh yeah ready put
this thing on I mean I'm pretty much as
ready as I'll ever be so with my first
attempt to get inside I immediately
noticed how difficult it is to really
get on your body I can't see the light
at the end of the tunnel I I see only
NIT it looks like it's gonna be scratchy
wool because it's got a lot of hair
sticking out of it but it feels pretty
soft overall it's hitting the ground
which is a little concerning I think
that this is how I'm gonna wear it
almost like with a little like a bowl
around the neck and it's also hard to
like decide how to wear it in a feasible
way Wow Wow Wow
I feel like the photos I saw were either
completely submerged or worn as a dress
kind of from the shoulders to the ground
today I will be cosplaying as sock Thea
what superpowers you have absolutely
none one of my concerns before I put it
on was the temperature but actually what
seemed to be the problem like from
minute one was the shedding of the wool
so we're about five minutes into wearing
this thing and I got a single hair in my
eye it was hard to find because it's
sort of a pale fabric or wool but I
think I got it out and now I'm fixing my
eyeliner because I really just went in
to try and find it I was also surprised
by the amount that I was able to use my
hands my finger side that's a little bit
of a hack for this but that said you
can't really do anything quickly so
after ironing out or at least
considering some of the logistical
issues I decided to go around and get
some reactions alright so I think we
should see what Krusty thinks of this
Krusty usually does not like my ugly
clothing items he hates that thing dude
he particularly hates anything with
plastic on it and I feel like this item
is the opposite of plastic so I thought
that he may like this one but alas I
don't think he likes it you think as he
likes to play with socks that he might
like you cuz you're a giant sock I think
I'm just too big I think that I was just
like a large woollen figure
over him and he was not about it
underneath here I look like I've just
played with a thousand cats because
there's so much extra wool on me I guess
maybe he's territorial don't I have this
in case we need it so with the ringing
endorsement of my cat I decided to take
my sweater scarf thing out on the town
and see what other people thought of it
in the car
I was pretty snugly and comfortable but
I also noticed how much I was shedding
you know I didn't actually think my arms
could get any hairier and blonde Wow but
besides that I was kind of wearing it
like a giant scarf sort of all piled
around my upper body and having a good
time
ready I'm gonna unfurl go for it yes
thing is it's kind of crisp outside I'd
say it's probably like 65 degrees out
here
I feel pretty good so our first stop was
Costco a place where I thought we could
find other people and also other socks
there my tiny brethren I was kind of
like the Will Ferrel from elf of socks
I don't know why I'm seven times bigger
than the rest of you I'm sorry but I'm
returning home and I want to be accepted
that said I think I thrives more or fit
in better as an area rug or a pillow of
some kind there you are
are you comfortable probably very much
so I was surprised though that right off
the bat this sweater was received very
well you know like you look good oh
thank you people seem to like it they
seem to want to buy the rugs that I was
posing next to people who are looking at
the area rugs after I left the area I'm
just saying this could be the new signs
minute they asked me where I got it
you're a big guy how do you get your
arms out at all
there's no wolves but I can wear it like
this oh but now you look like a sheep
way under got you it's pretty amazing
people were generally a fan of this
sweater
that's my no really great which usually
when I'm wearing ugly items I'd get a
couple compliments but this was more
like oh I need that listen you're
welcome
I'm selling many of your scarves at this
Costco in Burbank sweaters sweaters tube
socks dresses and even though I had been
running around for a couple of hours I'm
really not that hot man it's a good
joint but I'm not sweating don't get hit
there'll be a stupid obituary so one of
the really appealing things about this
to me is how many different ways you can
wear it which I sort of explored when I
first put it on this is a very versatile
sweater but after Costco I are today
Ament where'd you go I'm inside the room
and though this item requires a lot of
adjusting to you know make sure it's not
dragging on the ground or anything like
that it also is pretty fluid it can sort
of go from one form to the next quite
quick
though of course it does leave a trail
behind once you wear it anywhere just be
prepared for that I'm gonna be honest
this thing has shed so much wool I'm
surprised that there's really any
sweater left I think in the end I
figured out eight different ways to wear
this thing bunched up like an infinity
scarf the floppy Liberty Bell the
manatee or maybe the mermaid the
wintertime demo Corgan that other dude
from Pan's Labyrinth
the groping ghosts the wool of skirt and
the last one the champions belt i I'm
pretty sure that's eight which does sort
of bring up the question what exactly is
this thing so I decided to ask you all
the good kind people of Instagram to
help me decide what this is or at least
provide some insight and opinions
because I was torn so I posted a
compilation of four different photos of
this thing the first photo is me kind of
like posing sort of just with my head
and my feet out second photo is the
giant infinity scarf third photo is
fully deployed and the fourth photo is
sort of like it's the same as the first
that was not an option that was a vanity
photo just for me so I asked you guys is
this a sweater or scarf or creature from
the great beyond and based on the
responses I actually think the answer is
D sock or II need as in that thing from
the dr. Seuss book The Lorax picking
through the comments you guys did have
some opinions about it some of which
were negative are you dressed in a
foreskin some of which were mystified
looks like the cozy version of a
straitjacket
and a lot of which were positive or at
least desiring of it I need one of these
like every time I feel socially awkward
in public all I have to do is hide in it
where do I find this I need to be a
sweater burrito I love this sorry but
you are one crafty bitch I think that
this person may have thought that I made
this I did not all credit goes to do
Keanu but thank you I think from reading
comments headlines and from the
reactions I got when walking around that
a big reason people like this thing is
because of its escape
element the idea that you could snuggle
up inside it and completely disappear I
didn't find a lot of other examples of
this style in fashion but I did come
across a performance piece that an
artist named baya Camacho did called and
clothes where she crocheted herself into
a yarn cocoon continuously for 11 hours
to play with the ideas of isolation
security shelter and the shaping of
one's own environment back into the room
I go so part of the appeal is the exit
strategy maybe and the other part I
think is just the general coziness or a
mirroring of the desire to turn into a
literal couch potato I also really like
this thing but I think part of the
reason I liked it is because I could
play with it and also just warm around
and pretend to be a lot of different
things
you are like cousin it I'm not sure if
you're an amoeba or if you're ditto the
Pokemon I think I'm more of an amoeba
the mitochondria is the powerhouse of
the cell thank you very much though the
things I looked like spanned many
different categories I feel like most
specifically I look sort of like a magic
carpet or some type of inanimate object
that had become animate through magic so
we decided to go to the Wizarding World
of Harry Potter to try and see if I
would blend it I could be the Gray Lady
it could be peeps or I'm just like a
kowai Dement or I think you're the
sorting hat
that could be like the sorting hats
flaccid region
I will say that once I like went
completely furled into it people really
did think that I was like an amusement
attraction of some sort
people started taking photos one guy
reached out to see if I was real they
don't know that it's not part of Harry
Potter world like I think people were
just very sure that I had been hired to
wear this which if Universal you're
interested in me doing that for money I
would come back and do yes so after a
long day of adjusting moving and worming
around we had worked up quite an
appetite so we decided to go grab some
dinner which actually turned into a
don't eat the fluff off the sweater and
also don't drop anything on the sweater
challenge I think that finger food is
gonna be best because there's less of a
chance of it getting lost on the way you
know you're really a shark you then arms
once again you can like reach through
the fabric and sort of turn things about
and sort of you know get to where you
need to go and if you prepare or adjust
yourself accordingly you can use your
hands well I choose between arm and no
arm both or at least one of them
I'll have one but you know you just you
can't think fast catch new you're gonna
do that that time so as it got later in
the day it also got colder which was
more appropriate weather for a
floor-length sweater
yum wear a t-shirt and gym shorts oh and
joke's on you Tyler
so I invited him inside my tube of
warmth and love that sounds dirty we are
here are you warmer now
a giant blanket welcome to the womb
Tyler we are now the human mula Pete
actually I'm much warmer though so that
was my day wearing this thing I think
some of the other ugliest items in the
world are weird for the sake of fashion
and I think that this one is weird for
the sake of comfort and coziness which
is something that I'm on board with now
there are some cons to this tube number
one being the amount it sheds after a
day of wearing it I was covered in like
a half-inch thick layer of the stuff oh
well and besides the stray shedded hair
is getting on your clothes they can also
get in your eye which is actually
probably worse I keep getting this wool
in my face it's not ideal it does also
require a decent amount of adjusting
throughout the day and it also stretches
out and gets looser so by the end of the
day it was in danger of falling off at
times you think you're wearing clothes
that could have been disastrous but
overall this thing was super fun to wear
I'm not sure if I'm gonna continue
wearing it outside because it does drag
on the ground but I could see myself
cozying up inside maybe in a designated
area so I don't shed too much sock fiha
