hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm gonna be buying
suspiciously low-cost electronics from
wish that's right
wish sells electronics yeah they do so
I've ordered some stuff from wish before
including a week's worth of five-dollar
clothing as well as items that were
listed on the site as free and in
general these halls have been pretty hit
or miss but they definitely tend to be
exhilarating you're never quite sure
what you're gonna get so if you don't
know already wish is an e-commerce site
that sells basically everything at a
huge discount from fake tongues to
wedding dresses that said I've never
ventured into the gadget territory so
I'm not exactly sure what to expect but
I hope nothing bad happens so in terms
of price I'm gonna put a hard stop at
$100 per item as like the max max budget
if we find something we really like and
I think we're gonna get five things
today just so we don't go completely hog
wild
all right let's it advisedly spend some
more money on wish okay so I'm gonna
open up the wish website let's go to the
gadgets tab and see what they have for
us okay so right off the bat we've got a
large price range and we've got a lot of
different things we've got what looks
like a knockoff Apple watch for 13 bucks
and then like an iPhone for 330 bucks
which first secondhand iPhone like seems
like the normal market price so almost
like not really like a markdown I almost
don't even know where to begin
is this an mp3 player for free I'm not
trying to be too hard on wish but like
what the heck is going on here there's
no way that thing works Wow there are so
many things there's like Mouse's I mean
mice SD cards which I could use but that
wouldn't make a very exciting video what
is this real I just clicked on this
randomly because I was confused as to
what it was it's called the XO Vaughn HD
camera sunglasses polarized hidden mini
digital video recorder DV cam
it says that these sunglasses have a
mini recorder in them so it's like
snapchat spectacles but $100 cheaper and
you don't have to just put it on
snapchat the reviews are kind of like
random sounding great exactly what I
wanted
daughter loved them what an excellent
product there's not enough people saying
wow I can't believe this thing actually
works the only person I believe here is
William pushing the control button is
difficult with the glasses on I believe
you William I believe you are a real
person I kind of think we have to get
this and see if it works so I am going
to just add this to the cart well that's
definitely item one all right let's take
a look at what the next item will be is
it a GoPro for 28 bucks this is a 2017
in a hot fashion outdoor action sports
camera mini 30 metre waterproof Ultra HD
4k sport DV f 60 r helmet cam DV
camcorder Wi-Fi remote control LOV it
really looks like a GoPro I mean my
GoPros like 500 bucks wasn't it damn so
I want to see if this works because that
would be a great deal all right so this
has four and a half stars out of 127
reviews I love this one from Eloise
though she gives it one star and she
says very good oh I get to choose a
color for the GoPro I'm gonna get gold
because that's fantasy all right so for
this one the shifting is a little more
expensive the shipping is $13 so that
makes the entire item come out to 41 but
if this is a functioning GoPro dupe
that's still a good deal alright so that
is two products down we've got a couple
of cameras going so let's look for
something else this is a drone for three
nope it's landing gear extenders see
that's why you got to read what's in
here oh that's a vibrator there's more
this is NSFW oh what is this
this is 29 bucks it's a changeable
Halloween Christmas decoration light
projector lighting outdoor so basically
it's like one of these things that you
like set up in your lawn and you like
project stuff onto your house um these
look photoshopped but it looks like
they've got like
stars and jack-o'-lanterns and birds and
skulls and Santy Claus I see these all
over the place this time of year but
it's also something I wouldn't usually
buy for myself so let's try it out
there's a lot of interesting stuff
around here Wow there are hearing aids
on here for $4
I hope those work isn't drone this is
the aerial photography RC drone Wi-Fi
with HD camera four axis gyro one key
returned drone mobile phone control toy
the toy at the end makes me think that
this might be really small but I don't
see anything for scale as to how big it
actually is the only person whose review
I can see who didn't like it is Damien
and he just says not satisfied with the
product so that could mean anything I've
never had a drone before but I am
interested in getting one for some cool
drone shots and they're usually pretty
damn expensive so it'd be awesome if
this one works in decently enough you
can get it without camera which I don't
really know what you would do with that
alright cool so I'm gonna get this in
white that seems like a classic drone
color and let's buy this okay cool so
that is item number four so we just have
one more to go
I think honestly we have to get this
Apple watch knockoff thing because this
is the gadget that I've seen the most in
my time like sort of surfing around wish
so this is called the 2016 Android phone
Oh does that mean it won't work with my
phone Oh although know it says fully
compatible with smartphones and they say
Apple's iOS system this has four and a
half stars on 45 thousand reviews Wow
people like this except for Bryce who
can't figure out the texting I mean it
looks like an Apple watch it sounds like
an Apple watch I've never actually had
the desire to have an Apple watch but
we'll see what arrives and how it is
okay so those are my five items so we
got the hidden camera sunglasses the
GoPro dupe the Christmas light projector
the drone and this Android / Apple watch
I'm interested to see what's gonna
happen I'm excited I hope nothing
explodes I was gonna make an ill-advised
Samsung Galaxy joke but I won't do it
alright so it's been about two months
I ordered all of my wish electronics and
they're all finally here so I'm thinking
let's start smallest to largest so I'm
gonna pluck this one off the top and get
into it so this one is the smart watch
tada
Oh instructions so they say hello friend
what they're coming from my brand Tyler
all right so here's the watch it doesn't
look like it has any battery in it right
now so I'm gonna plug this into a
computer with multi wire and hope that
some charging will revive it or not
revive it will will vive it I'm gonna
try and press this button again oh oh it
vibrating my hand oh it's upside down
that's a smart watch you know this looks
almost exactly like my phone from 2008
it looks like they have a lot of apps
including Facebook and Twitter but I
don't think I can open anything without
a SIM card so I think we should go and
like get a SIM card for this thing and
then try and use it all right so we're
at Best Buy right now the guy helping us
actually tried to use the SIM card
that's inside of my
but apparently that's a nano SIM card
and we need a micro SIM card so we're
adding this to my phone plan for 10
bucks for a month just to see I want to
tweet from my wrist okay so we're back
so I think we should try and finally do
something with this watch all right so
let's open Twitter what it still says
insert valid SIM card I also can't even
just open Twitter to see what it would
look like like it won't let me open
anything
I just did a last-ditch attempt at
Bluetooth connecting it to my phone but
it doesn't seem to be doing anything
even with the Bluetooth on okay I know I
can put a micro SD card in here for the
camera so let's see if we can at least
take a photo how do I where's my face oh
look there's Tyler's face oh hi oh
that's a good photo can I take a selfie
is the question I'm gonna have to take
this off my wrist to get a selfie oh
that's not so bad
it's fun that like there are some
capabilities of this thing that does
work but I'm pretty disappointed that
the SIM card that we put in doesn't work
at all so I think that you know I'm
gonna have to write this wish electronic
off as a failure I'm just sad that I
didn't get to tweet and I know that
everyone else is also sad okay so next
up I'm going to tackle this package
which is the HD video camera sunglasses
let's open these bad boys up and see
what they look like
oh those are classic mm Wow No
do I look like I've just come from the
optometrist yes I think the camera is
this hole right in the front and I think
this button on the side that lights up
is the record button it looks like
there's an SD card slot here and the
instructions say to charge it for at
least four hours so let's leave it to
charge and then go try it out alright so
I've got my camera sunglasses and my
instructions I've charged them for a
while
hopefully they'll work could use some
sun protection right about now I touch
the camera dammit I hope I didn't fuck
it up so it says that I should press the
video photo button for three seconds and
the blue LED indicator should blink and
then it'll start recording oh I think
it's recording the blue light blinked
alright so I'm just gonna look around
look at those palm trees Wow so it's
pretty hard to tell out in the field if
you've recorded anything or not so I'm
going to tap this button once to turn it
off and hopefully that worked so let's
plug this guy in and see if we got
anything so it looks like a disc called
no-name has popped up so let's open that
up and see nothing before we're sure
that it's nothing let me just try and
put the SD card in there directly
instead of through the glasses
all right here's no-name and there's
nothing on it I'm not surprised
I guess because these sunglasses do feel
like kind of light and flimsy I mean
there is some possibility that I used
them incorrectly but to be fair the
instructions were pretty vague and they
were like just follow the blinking
lights and it seems like this light
blinks pretty arbitrarily instead of a
suspiciously cheap gadget I think you
might have gotten overpriced sunglasses
yeah I think I just bought some creepy
like late 90s looking machines alright
so next up is this package which I'm
pretty sure is the Christmas light
projector thing arrived just in time
though this video may be going up after
Christmas so for you guys it's not in
time
it basically looks like it's just like a
light that we put one of these cards in
and then it just sort of quick jacks it
I actually think that all of this extra
stuff is if you want to mount it into
the ground so honestly let's just see
what happens when we plug this thing in
yeah oh look look at the little wall
alright so it seems to be working
Tyler's gonna turn the lights off so we
can see it oh so cute we should go prank
people and project Santa's on their
houses cool should we try some of the
other slides so it looks like they've
got a bunch of different slides for
different occasions oh I love the
snowflakes oh yes that's my favorite so
far and then just for fun the shamrocks
so this projector was super fun inside
but we decided to bring some holiday
cheer around my neighborhood all right
so I've got a car adapter for a little
wintertime fun projector this is my
Christmas prank oh oh it's working oh
look at that oh it look at that we
decided to go with the snowflakes for
this one to spread some
nondenominational holiday cheer good
tidings to this construction site good
tidings for Christmas and a happy new
house I really liked taking this thing
out on the town now that is a good hand
I don't think you necessarily have to
get this type of thing from wish I'm
sure other people sell it for probably
similar amounts of money because this
thing wasn't that cheap but I had a good
time I would definitely bring it out
again on st. Patrick's Day and I am
overall pleased with this purchase so
next up is this product which is our
GoPro dupe oh hello
is this it boom yep that's it I mean
that looks like a GoPro it is a little
lighter and like somewhat flimsy ER
feeling than a true GoPro but it also
seems a lot like a GoPro so I'm gonna
plug it in and charge it and then we'll
take it outside and compare it to an
actual GoPro those kind of oh did you
hear that
alright so I've got my wish for case
sports cam and my GoPro Hero 5 here so
they do actually look decently different
and they do have a different weight to
them with the batteries inside the GoPro
is a decent amount heavier
which is kind of what throws me off
about this thing is like how light it is
all right let's report shall we yes
ready yeah alright so looking at the
footage there's no question that the
true GoPro has better quality footage
than this wish dupe say hello Tyler I
mean they're both recording or at least
they say they're recording let's just do
a quick pan of our surroundings
but this thing actually does kind of
work there's like the monitors image
look different the monitor images
actually look really different I tried
to put them on the same settings so the
GoPros image looks much more zoomed out
the footage from the 4k sports cam looks
fine in our editing software and in the
video but when I first played it in
QuickTime on my computer it looks crazy
I don't know if it's the file format or
something but it looks like the Blair
Witch Project overall I definitely
wouldn't choose this over my GoPro and
it doesn't replicate the quality of a
GoPro but it's not not a camera I don't
know about 4k but it was okay so for our
last item we've got this drone tada
this is not assembled I have never flown
a drone before but I'm excited about it
I feel like Casey nice out already so
they don't exactly have instructions of
how to put it together but just from
looking at the ending product I think I
can pretty much guess looks like this is
the camera question mark it's very
unclear what the cameras gonna do
because there's no monitor down here to
see what I'm recording on the drone I
would guess that it should go here but
instead I've got the silver sticker so
we're just gonna be winging it alright
let's go fly a drone as I hold it it
just feels so suspiciously light I could
just
feels like there's not enough drone
there I feel like it's just gonna get
swept up by the wind even if it doesn't
take off this looks like a nice little
clearing I'm gonna trying pressing
buttons so after taking this thing out
for a spin I am pretty pleased that it
did in fact levitate off the ground you
know it did its drone thing
it flew around a little bit did I kill
it I'm sorry I feel bad I'm not sure if
it was hard to control or if both Tyler
and I were just sort of bad at it should
I try and catch it a little higher in my
hand I don't know if they could see that
I would say that this is definitely a
fun toy we had a good time
it didn't hurt anyone so it's very
stressful that's gonna hit that hold I
know I said sorry to my beer and I'm
sorry but I do not think it is the type
of drone that I would have wanted
because to me the main utility of a
drone is to get like really cool like
overhead shots of stuff for a video and
this camera is nonsense
I put an SD card in here and it got lost
inside and started jangling around
there's no input to get footage off of
it there's no way to turn on the camera
you catch it in the light and you're
like is that like everyone no it's like
a piece of red foil so if you want a toy
like it's fun but if you want a drone
that can actually take footage for you
it is not that I feel like on a scale
from like 1 to KC nice dad
I was like a single sunglass lens ok so
that was my wish electronics haul in
general the stuff was pretty hit or miss
I'd say that the only thing that worked
as well as I thought it was supposed to
work was the little light projector
obviously the sunglasses and the
SmartWatch were pretty big
disappointments to me the sunglasses I
feel like straight up like may not have
a camera in there at all but the
SmartWatch was extra disappointing
because it gave me a false sense of hope
the sports cam in the drone did function
to some level but they weren't good
enough that I would say that you would
want to buy this stuff instead of the
actual product I think in general the
quality of the products that these
things are trying to replicate are just
much higher than these
and even if the price is a lot cheaper I
feel like you're just not gonna get
really what you want at all I think
maybe the overall takeaway of this video
is if an electronic product is
suspiciously cheap and also suspiciously
light it probably is not gonna work
it may fly off the ground and almost hit
you in the face but it's not gonna have
a camera to record it thank you guys so
