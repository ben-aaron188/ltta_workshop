hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm gonna be dressing like
we did 50 years ago in 1967 1967 was the
year that brought us the summer of love
Disney's The Jungle Book the first
successful human heart transplant and
the births of Vin Diesel Julia Roberts
and Rolling Stone magazine from the
Mamas to the Papas 1967 was a year of
looking for Lucy in the Sky with
Diamonds and getting seduced by mrs.
Robinson
while Jimi Hendrix was setting his
guitar on fire thousands of people
marched on Washington to try and
literally lift the Pentagon building
with their minds yes that actually
happened in regards to what we were
wearing it was a year of short skirts
Nehru jackets clear plastic clothing and
flowers in your hair as for hairstyles
sixties hair was all over the map some
of it was long and unkempt some of it
was super short and some of it was
quaffed
into gravity defying modern art pieces
so once again I recruited my friend
Kaylee Melissa a hair stylist and
youtuber to aid me in my quest to become
a far-out 60s chick so with some
assistance and after consulting a few
magazines sewing patterns a little bit
of Mad Men and my dad I think I've
managed to put together three outfits
that represent some of the iconic styles
of the time as always I'm going to be
focusing mostly on American style though
for this video I feel like it's
impossible to ignore the British
influences on 60s fashion so 1967 what
happened and what we wore so for my
first outfit I went for this mod mini
dress ensemble fix new buttons
pretty far out that's how high they hurt
this look was inspired by 1960s icons
like Twiggy Jean Shrimpton Goldie Hawn
and these girls in the background of the
Austin Powers intro sequence groovy baby
oh my god a key piece of the swinging
60s was the miniskirt a controversial
fashion statement that spread like
wildfire ruffling the feathers of fame
designers like Coco Chanel who said it
was just awful
as well as fans of traditional fashion
everywhere fine what's that I've never
heard of that before
yes that's what's above your knees what
Sharon no skirts and dresses in the 50s
were usually full and hit at the knee
and miniskirts were only really seen in
sci-fi movies giving the mini when it
was popularized in the 60s a futuristic
appeal it's kind of weird to think about
thighs being innovative because I feel
like I've been wearing minis my whole
life but you know here we go
sigh so for this outfit I chose a green
mini dress with buttons down the front
ivory colored stockings black Mary Jane
shoes a black plastic handbag and this
giant green bangle this is the greenness
you've ever been I love how I like kind
of came to this park to be like oh I'll
match but I'm like way more neon than
the grass this mod style of bright
colors short cuts and geometric shapes
had become pretty widespread the year
earlier in 1966 you keep on trying to
have like a shocked look on your face I
don't know I feel like that's the pose
yeah like you're supposed to be like oh
when style icon and model Twiggy erupted
onto the fashion scene
oh I'm Twiggy
with a lot of a bigger butt I'm sick e
GH I see see why
but before mod was a style it was also a
subculture the mod short for modernist
scene originated in British jazz clubs
in the late 50s post-war England was
seeing good economic times and young
people had extra pocket change which
they spent on high-end clothes new
records and decked out Vespa scooters
mods congregated in 24-hour coffee bars
to listen and danced jazz music coffee
bar let's go in
powered by caffeine amongst other things
where's the jukebox
well it's not in the pretzel section it
Kayle a new instrument from india
however whether it was the Twiggy board
games or lunchboxes by 1967 as many
people flocked to the mod style most of
the original mods tired of the
mainstream attention and moved on so mob
turned from a noun to an adjective from
the mods to mod style once you've made
the JCPenney and Spiegel catalog you're
pretty mainstream for my hair we went
with this bangs and slight pouf style
feel that mod was all about like the
shapes and their lines
so we're basically creating shapes and
lines with your hair hair architecture
that's what this is 1967 was a
transition year in many ways and fur
hair I think we were caught between the
hairspray to death flip of the earlier
60s and the free flowing locks of the
seventies I hope I didn't mess up my
banks too much I promised Kayleigh I
wouldn't touch him but I feel like I've
been touching them and for my makeup I
went with pale eyeshadow a black cat eye
winged a Twiggy inspired cut crease line
twice as much flight power and nude
lipstick I think white lipstick was also
in but a pale pale nude was a popular
choice mod style was revived in the
1980s and in the 2000s and though I feel
like muted nude and dark colors are more
in style than bright neons nowadays mod
fashion is so iconic that it tends to
pop up regularly do I look swingin
as long as you don't hit the camera
swimming 60s swinging that's a weapon
so for my next look I rode the fashioned
pendulum all the way down to the ground
with this body skimming maxi dress I
called this outfit
the lengthy lady maxi mama mm for this
outfit I paired this long purple
patterned dress with silver bangles
shoes a silver handbag and these large
blueish pearly earrings you look like
you've been in casing like a rhinestone
for 40 years I just popped out 50 years
while the early and mid 60s brought with
them the miniskirt the end of the decade
brought a completely opposite silhouette
into the picture long unseen CH dresses
in a loose almost nightgown desk style
were all over the fashion magazines that
I found from 1967 gone were the girdles
of the 50s in fact the less you could
see of the waist and the better I'm
trying to stand up as straight as
possible because there's no shape to the
dress
so I'm like I must have shoulders like a
hanger this fashion 180 but the trend of
hemlines getting progressively shorter
with time as dresses hadn't been this
long since World War one I think it like
the max enos of the dress is also
applying dear dramatic Miss excuse you
in general
these looks were inspired by
international designs like the caftan
from the Middle East and North Africa
and the Nehru collar and paisley pattern
from India I feel like it's hard to
really like pinpoint who exactly this
girl is she's kind of just like a
fashion-forward adult woman you look
like a penguin you could be at home
you could be at a house party you could
be out working you could be Gipp setting
vacationing lunching a lot of different
opportunities to wear this dress
augmented by some highly publicized
celebrity trips to South Asia in the
late 60s international air travel as a
whole was perceived as glam and
luxurious and if you were going
somewhere exotic that also meant
dressing the part in this an appropriate
moment for the transatlantic accent it
might be hello Fred oh my god welcome to
another video I just immediately
regretted that and even if you weren't
going anywhere
maybe you also wanted to join in on the
fun oh my god so designers like Emilio
Pucci created looks that channeled that
jet-setting fantasy that's total cz this
yeah don't worry this is plastic this
dress in particular was my grandmother's
from India her brother who lived in the
u.s. sent her the fabric and she had it
sewn into this dress so not necessarily
internationally inspired but literally
international also a secret pocket for
my hair we went with a structured up do
with this braid detail and we both spent
a lot of time looking through images
last night and we agreed that the Ariana
Grande silhouette was very popular it
seems like abstract somewhat impractical
styles with strategic baubles and lots
of volume were favored to complement
these loose maxi dresses though in the
60s these would have been achieved with
hair clip-ons known as wig lifts for
this look Hayley just used some hair
extensions to give my head helmet some
body you've got like a second head back
here I'm a little bit like Professor
Quirrell yeah it's also like your second
head has like a will buyers haircut for
my makeup I chose a pale blue eyeshadow
and black cat eyeliner and once again a
very muted lip color I think in general
for 60s makeup you needed like some
serious eyeliner and some very very
light lipstick gloss
something it's almost like the 2007
concealer lip this dress made me feel
and act a little bit over-the-top I
think I was trying to channel good old
Liz Taylor oh I've married full 45 men
and kept all the jewels it was accurate
who coincidentally gathered quite to the
kaftan collection during her life
Maxie's mostly replaced the miniskirt
silhouette in the 70s and also had a
stint of popularity in the 90s a la
Phoebe Buffay I personally love maxi
skirts because I don't have to shave my
legs to wear them but I'm not sure how
long I would truly last inside of that
hair helmet it was pretty hard so for my
third outfit I went for a hippie
inspired summer of love and look look at
my Bush the copic it is the hippie
movement was born in Northern California
in the mid-1960s
made up of people who sought alternative
ways to perceive the world and build
society I am a blade of grass swaying in
the wind that's like a nineteen sixties
version of firework at times or most of
the time
encouraged by mind-altering and
psychedelic substances do you ever feel
like a blade of grass
getting plucked into someone else's
joint diametrically opposed to the
establishment and the escalation of the
Vietnam War the movement laced music
politics drug use and philosophy into a
distinct culture ready to explode by
1967 see I'm trying to do some moves
that I think would be appropriate I
think I just make a little bit like a
mom at Coachella I kind of call it like
massaging curtains though LSD was banned
in the u.s. in October of 1966 hippies
paid that pretty much no mind and
continued to congregate and take
psychedelics pretty brazenly I'm just
hugging the tree nothing to see here
just an active job on the backs of
popular musicians such as Jefferson
Airplane the Grateful Dead and Jimi
Hendrix the growth of psychedelic
culture spread nationwide and reached
the mainstream with the Summer of Love
in San Francisco where hundreds of
thousands gathered to demonstrate their
alignment with the hippie philosophy are
you dog circling right now I'm nesting I
mean I hate to break through that patch
right there might be from like dog piss
but you know let me just nest slightly
to the left there this outfit includes a
Paisley patterned orange mini dress a
plain knitted bag Brown gladiator
sandals lots of beaded necklaces these
circle ends Dwyer rimmed sunglasses and
an orange headband I also went with
pretty natural makeup and very very long
hair I almost feel like I shouldn't even
be wearing clothes like I should just be
wearing hair just cover my boobs with
the hair and then just keep going is
that the plot of the musical hair it
might be this look overall was inspired
by a few celebrities associated with the
counterculture movement like Michelle
Phillips of the Mamas and the Papas
Janis Joplin Cher and Pattie Boyd Beatle
George Harrison's wife and to really
finish off the look we did need a little
George Harrison his love his love of a
Beatle
what's that accent Liverpool the Tyler's
look is inspired directly from George's
outfit here which includes a white shirt
denim jacket pendants necklace Paisley
pants brown shoes heart-shaped
wire-rimmed sunglasses and a nice thick
moustache
have you seen Paul and Ringo I think
they're hiding in your mustache tie
well I'm Heidi from Yoko as pretty much
the biggest band in the world
The Beatles brought a lot of attention
to psychedelic culture I am the Eggman I
am The Walrus
Pikachu talking openly about their
experimentation and how it influenced
their music particularly their 67 album
Sgt pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
she's very easy to entertain she's like
he's killing people walk admire like
he's not very good though neither of us
are wearing flowers another name for
hippy was flower child as the flower
held a strong significance for the
movement you bought it those flowers yes
all of their names are Susan oftentimes
worn in the hair like the now snapchat
famous flower crown the flowers fit very
nicely on my headband which I like the
items meaning expanded in October of 67
when after attempts to levitate the
Pentagon failed
hippies filled the barrels of soldiers
rifles with flowers and flower power as
a form of peaceful protest was born of
course the real hippies didn't have this
but hey oh I got the flower crowd now
that looks good okay this looked to me
feels kind of like a meme outfit of what
a hippie would wear I think that things
like paisley patterns and long hair and
headbands were so widespread that
nowadays this almost looks like a hippie
costume but hey you know the meme had to
come from somewhere in general though
the mantra for hippies was that you
should dress like your own fantasy so a
lot of people wore whatever they wanted
from jeans and t-shirts to absolutely
nothing you know it's just it's more
freeform don't let the man tell you what
to wear man look this is where they
stock the wood it's Woodstock oh my god
we drove all the way here for that one
line all right let's go so those were my
1967 outfits overall it was really fun
trying to style looks around the 1967
aesthetic
I think the 60s are a very iconic decade
and a lot of the styles have been
revived many times over and almost never
seem to go fully out of fashion if I
were gonna bring anything back from 67
it would be the Mod hair the caftans
and Tyler's mustache so thank you guys
so much for sticking around for an
entire half-century of outfits this year
from the 2000s to the 60s it seems like
a lot of things have come in and out of
style and the fashion pendulum has swung
from one end to the other and back again
I hope you enjoyed this little mini dive
