hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm going to be buying the
first five things from Instagram
celebrities sponsored posts so in the
past I've done videos on buying the
first five things that social media
platforms recommend to me based on their
ad algorithm today we're not reviewing
an algorithm but I wanted to take on the
products that use influencers on
Instagram specifically to market
themselves
now a quick preface I don't want to
throw any shade at anyone who markets
this way or who make sponsored posts I'm
mostly just curious to see what these
products are like because I've seen a
lot of the same products in Instagram
sponsored posts before but I've never
had the courage to try any of them so
today we're gonna be prowling around
Instagram and seeing what we can find
let's do it so what I've deduced from
some Instagram trolling stalking and
researching is that I tend to see these
ads on the instagrams of people who have
built their following through reality
television so I made this wheel to
randomly choose from this pool of
reality TV shows so basically I'm gonna
spin this wheel so it chooses a show and
from there we'll pick one of the stars
of that show go to their instagrams and
scroll until we find the first sponsored
post and buy it so the shows we have are
Teen Mom The Bachelor and all of its
franchises Keeping Up with the
Kardashians the Real Housewives
including every location the Jersey
Shore and models okay
let's spin the wheel of sponsorship
I'm hype oh that was pretty good okay so
our first category is Teen Mom okay so
for Teen Mom the person that comes to
mind immediately for me is Maci Bookout
she's like my favorite out of all the
Teen Mom girls so let's go to Macy's
page and see what sponsored post she has
done most recently here we go
Maci dashain book out her most recent
post is actually just a cute photo with
her and Caitlyn who's also from Teen Mom
but the post before that already looks
promising so the second two most recent
post is for flat belly t the holidays
are right around the corner and I want
to be sure my tummy is flat not to
mention the energy it gives me amazing
use co2 Macy for 25% off hashtag thank
me later
it seems to be a tea detox or cleanse
which I've actually seen around
Instagram a lot before they seem to have
a lot of photos of like the for and
afters of people trying it and I think
what it's supposed to do is just like
reduce bloating in your tummy area so
you've got like a nice flat stomach I'm
not sure if this one says it but I've
also heard that they're supposed to act
kind of like um regulators almost like
an Activia like they're good for like
flushing out toxins and they make you
people off but that's just what I've
heard okay so I'm gonna get a beginners
pact 14-day t talks Maisie got me a
sweet $7.47 off of this purchase so
thanks Maisie okay so item one check
this is the flat belly teeth beginners
pack shall we spin again the Jersey
Shore so I think that to me at least
like when I think of Jersey Shore I
think almost immediately of Snooki so
let's see what the Snooks is up to the
snookums bull Snooks Snooki Snuka Oh
her son is so cute she's just working
out looks like oh that looks hard oh
this looks promising
hashtag add tummy redemption time hell
yes at flat tummy code so it looks like
another if not t talks and some kind of
like shake that helps you stay slim or
maybe also poop a lot I'm a little
nervous to be doing like to like flat
tummy detoxes at the exact same time so
let's see if we can find something a
little bit different ooh okay here we go
Snooki says falsies wow haven't thought
about those since I got my two-step lash
elixir kit buy at the Queen Pegasus my
lashes are looking long AF magical AF
and badass AF after only just a few
weeks
so get hashtag pega fied at the Queen
Pegasus com
I was like on board until hashtag pega
fight from what I can tell it looks like
they just have like two like mascara
looking wands and you just apply it like
mascara for third
and then you'll never need falsies again
all right so let's get this I think
that's all there is to it so once it
gets here we'll start on putting them on
and see if I can truly get pega fide
okay so on to spin number three oh yeah
The Bachelor The Bachelor and it's many
spin-offs may not have created a lot of
long lasting marriages but they've
created many Instagram celebrities so
looking at the last couple of bachelors
and bachelorettes
Jojo Fletcher the Bachelorette from two
cycles ago does seem to do some of these
sponsored posts so let's check her out
her most recent was like a cute selfie
and then her third most recent post is
this post with um bombay hair holy carp
Jojo this thirty two millimeter rose
gold curling wand is a hundred and
thirty dollars
I hadn't set like a strict price limit
for this video but it feels like a
hundred dollars is like a good place to
stop so let's see if Jojo has anything
slightly more reasonably priced aha okay
so here's another sponsored post at
fabfitfun getting me extra excited for
scarf and beanie season so many goodies
in the fall box swipe through to see
some of my favorite ones so basically
what this is is it's like a lifestyle
box I'm pretty sure it's not just makeup
or like just hair or like just clothes I
think they like curate a bunch of
different things for you and put it in a
box every season so let's get a box and
see how it is okay great
Jojo did give me $10 off that's legit so
I'm gonna finish checking out and then
we'll spin again
teen mom part two so thinking of a
second teen mom star the first one that
comes to mind is Kaelyn Lowry
she's from Teen Mom 2 but I think it
counts so her first sponsored post is
her second post which is a lull bed
it looks like the lull beds go for about
$850 which is a little out of my price
range for this video so let's see what
else we've got going on in Caleb's page
shall we so she's got the Queen Pegasus
elixir that Snooki had a baby car seat
cover that I could buy but I don't have
a car seat for it to cover and also
another tea detox but the one after that
I think that we could do for sure this
one is for hey white smile so it's like
a teeth whitener thing use kale at
checkout to save 50% off your kit today
okay so it looks like on their website
they have a few different kits but this
seems like the right type of kit it's a
hey white smile whitening kit one person
kit for 25 bucks maybe by the end of
this I'm just gonna be like lashes to
the heavens pooping really well with
really white teeth you know all right so
let's complete this order and get us a
hey white smile whitening kit and that
is item number four okay so we're down
to our final spin so let's give it a
whirl shall we oh yeah
Keeping Up with the Kardashians is our
final category first I wanted to try
mama Kris Jenner but all she had that I
could find was another Queen Pegasus
lash elixir ad so I turned to Chloe
alright looks like she's Pro mowing the
show but if I scroll back just a little
bit I do see what looks like a very
classic sugar bear hair ad yes I'm still
in love with at sugar bear hair love how
my hair looks and feels these amazing
hair vitamins are delicious to me sugar
bear hair is like the meme Instagram ad
product just because I've seen so many
ads for it I've never tried it so let's
get them and see if the vitamins do
anything to my hair okay so I'm gonna
buy 30 days worth of sugar bear hair and
so with that I
that we have our five Instagram
celebrity recommended products so some
of these products have like longer
tryouts associated with them so we're
definitely gonna try these products over
a period of time but the next time you
see me I'll have my haul and we'll see
how and if these things work alright so
this is what I've got so far
so I'm gonna start trying out all of
these items tonight and use them for the
designated amount of time and then at
the end we'll do a review of everything
we've got including the fabfitfun box so
it's been about two months since I
filmed the first part of this video and
I'm finally here with my haul and some
opinions so let's start with this one
the fabfitfun box okay so it looks like
they've given me some sort of newsletter
oh it looks like Ayesha curry is on the
front and it says she wants to get in
your kitchen
well are you sure that's very forward of
you alright so let's see what's inside
it's been so long since I paid for this
thing that it almost feels like it's
free but of course it is not free so
this thing right on top is this silver
necklace honestly I think it's a pretty
cute necklace it reminds me a lot of
that other choker that I got all the way
back in the day wood we did the facebook
ad haul you do not remember I remember
fairly fun rivers alright so next up is
this deep sleep pillow spray it says
it's got the lavender vet evert and wild
camomile oh I like that
here I'll walk some to you smells good
we've also got like a bunch of skincare
products this Ahava Dead Sea mineral
hand cream this exfoliate exfoliating
treatment from Kate Somerville that
Tyler actually has used before and
really likes it styler approved as well
as these golden under-eye masks from
Greyson Stella they also sent me a nude
eyeshadow palette by deuce you say
deuces we also got these aloe infused
festive fuzzy socks as well as this mug
from Ayesha curry alright so I think I
just have one thing left it is supposed
to be a poncho or Poncho's back I'm lost
where am I going
is this it there's like a notch here
this is not a poncho this is a shawl you
know who would like this my grandma I
think that I'm going to pack this back
up and give it to her okay so that was
my fabfitfun box it's pretty expensive
for a box though there seem to be pretty
high priced items in there the things
that I'm most excited about are the
necklace the mug and the pillow spray
the socks are definitely going to Tyler
they look like something on would it
take from you I gotta be honest and I
think that the knot poncho is going to
my grandmother but overall I feel like
it was a fun box all right let's move on
to the other items so next up are the
sugar bear hair vitamins so this one I
actually had to try for 30 days and it's
generally supposed to like help your
hair grow I think like longer stronger
healthier all that good jazz oh it
smells strong did you ever have those
Disney Princess fruit snacks
it smells exactly like those they smell
like shark bites they're a little melted
I wonder what happened they all look a
little bit like that from what I could
know yeah but let's pop them in right at
first the gummies were like way too
sweet for me but over the course of the
month I grew to like them a little bit
more they taste like lemon drops
but that said I'm not sure exactly what
they did it's definitely not like
Rapunzel level but it's getting pretty
long it's very easy to perceive oh it's
kind of like taking any vitamin it's
hard to say like if my bones feel
stronger or my blood feels more irony
it's just kind of like small hard to
tell differences I don't think I'm gonna
repurchase these but if you wanted to
try it out it's probably pretty similar
to taking other biotin and folic acid
vitamins and these gummies were pretty
fun to eat so next up is this hey white
smile teeth whitening kit so basically
inside of here they give you a pair of
tooth trays and then a few syringes full
of whitening fluid and then also this
light and basically you like
self-administer the whitening fluid into
the tray nope oh there is no diagram as
to how this is supposed to go pop it in
and you do it for like six days straight
so before I did this my teeth looked
like this I think I'm gonna for ya
we got four heads about right and after
five days of doing it if my teeth looked
like this am i three or two now I think
it definitely could be like a two
there's no question to me
my teeth were generally whiter there was
and kind of still is a small stain on
this tooth right here there is L stain
I'm talking about I'm not exactly sure
how that would have come from this but
it did appear very suddenly which makes
me think that I messed up somehow or
didn't do it right
which brings me to my main complaint
which is just that I need more detailed
instructions I would say that I feel
like I need supervision why is anyone
letting me do this by myself especially
given the seemingly medical greatness of
it all it felt like I just didn't know
what I was doing I was whitening in the
dark
are you doing you're joking yeah no you
just shine them onto your teeth yeah
like that mm-hmm
so I would either try a different
company just with more instructions or
just like stick to like Crest
Whitestrips and just like give myself
more time to whiten all right so next up
is the Queen Pegasus lash elixir so this
product was another 30 day try the way
it works is you put like a base
nutrition layer on the base of your
lashes much or how close I'm supposed to
get and then you use this crystal coat
on your lashes themselves to like help
nourish the lashes as well oh this is
supposed to be a liquid crystal potion
okay I'm just gonna apply this like
mascara be silly so when I started the
treatment my lashes looked like this
these are my before lashes and this is
how they look now and these are my
lashes 30 days later my lashes don't
look so night and day different that
you'd think I was wearing fake lashes
but there may be some difference in like
thickness or length they might be a
little bit more lush lusty pega fide I
do have a couple of issues with this
product though my biggest issue is that
when you're putting it on your lashes
every single night like a little bit
gets in your eye
warning avoid contact with eye yeah you
better go wash that out but I often
found myself
after applying not being able to see
like I felt like some of it was kind of
sneaking onto my eyeball almost like a
film or like something on my eye but
besides that I didn't really have any
complaints it's pretty easy to use but I
don't think that the difference is to me
are worth the hassle so I don't think
that I'm gonna keep using this
so my next and final product is the Flat
Belly tea tea talks so this product was
a 14 day cleanse with 14 morning tea
bags and seven night tea bags and in
general its supposed to help with
healthy weight loss but if you read the
packet it basically says it works like a
laxative
this lens will most likely induce a
laxative effect okay which was true but
thankfully wasn't explosive are you
lightly eat other food this stuff yeah
you just drink this tea also oh it's
sweet Oh what that was a big surprise
sorry I'm having a hard time looking
into the camera after those lash things
I would say that overall I actually
really liked this tea stalks
oh it's kind of minty I will say that I
think the tea tastes really good
and I also liked kind of having a ritual
like I like like drinking my tea in the
morning and drinking it at night taking
the time I don't think that this is like
a miracle weight-loss product on their
website there was a focus on before and
after results so these were my
measurements before the tea talks and
these were my measurements after the tea
talks so my measurements actually
increased I blame that on Thanksgiving
though because that fell like right in
the middle of the detox I feel like I
would buy this tea again do you miss it
already I do kind of miss it already I
like the taste of the tea a lot I
wouldn't recommend it as like a weight
loss product but you know if you're
constipated who could help alright so
that was my Instagram celebrity
sponsored post haul overall I'd say the
products were kind of hit or miss I
think my favorite things were the
fabfitfun box and the Flat Belly tea
talks the other products weren't
terrible I just feel like they didn't
work for me for one reason or another
that said though I did have a fun
time trying out products that I feel
like I've seen so many times before so
I'm glad that I did this either way I
did get a very nice mug and I am also
not constipated not that I was before
but I'm definitely not now thank you
