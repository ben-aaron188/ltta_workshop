hello friends and welcome to another
video this week I'm gonna be dressing
according to my zodiac or astrological
sign so for a while I've been seeing
these posts all over Instagram with
different clothing items categorized as
different zodiac signs and it made me
wonder if dressing like one zodiac sign
was a thing in general I'm not someone
who follows astrological advice to the
teeth but I think it's fun to read and I
would say that it is sometimes right as
for my sign I was born on July 16th so
I'm a cancer which if you don't know is
also a crab I definitely think that in
terms of names and mascots we've gotten
the shaft as cancers we are supposed to
be from what I know
caring emotional sensitive homebodies we
crave comfort and love I think that
description is somewhat reflective of my
personality it's not a hundred percent
on the nose but it's definitely a little
right in terms of fashion I would
interpret cancers traits as liking
comfortable clothing of all sorts which
is actually pretty on the nose for me so
after doing a little bit of research I
think I've found enough zodiac outfit
recommendations from different sources
to test them out for a whole week I'm
curious to see if they're accurate at
describing my current style sense and if
they aren't see if they uncover an
underlying style desire that I have not
yet explored all right let's go so for
day one I pieced together an outfit from
a few different posts from a zodiac
Instagram account
I am trying very hard not to get these
shoes dirty Oh get out of here plants
mess with my groove
I took posts mostly from this account to
zodiac steen and the outfit consists of
a pink corset top a pair of dark wash
jeans a white pair of vans sneakers and
a pink iridescent lip color and also
these sunglasses so out of this outfit I
already owned the lipstick and the jeans
so I had to go get these sunglasses the
top and the shoes so I as a cancer had
about 40% of the items that they
recommended for cancers
or things that were close enough to sub
in for the items there isn't a ton of
visibility into the decision-making
behind these posts but I did message a
bunch of these accounts one of them did
get back to me one last break free and
they said that they mostly try and match
the items to the personality of the
zodiac sign I think that the pants and
the shoes fit in with that they're
pretty comfortable and simple the top is
a little more questionable because it's
like a corset top so there is some like
boning to contend with and just general
like something in of that soft crab like
underbelly I think the spirit of it is
that it's supposed to look like lingerie
or something to wear to bed which would
make sense for a homebody or someone who
likes to stay in but I would prefer a
flannel top or some type of sleeping
shirt overall I would say this outfit is
pretty neutral except for the top which
isn't really my style
this corset also has like very
structured boob parts so like my boobs
are looking pretty big which is it's not
bad it's new so besides these Instagram
accounts there are also a lot of other
websites and publications that have
written about style suggestions
according to your zodiac sign like with
day two I went with this outfit from
stitch fix Tyler is so used to me
wearing all black that he's just like
casually putting an open cup of coffee
in the car I'm wearing a white shirt and
a white scarf this is not okay so in
this outfit stitch fix recommended to me
a denim jacket a white button-down shirt
a black and white infinity scarf a black
a line skirt and colorful pumps I did
actually have some of this in my closet
already this denim jacket is mine and
this black skirt is mine so I had to
find this infinity scarf this white
shirt and these pumps so they basically
define the Cancerian style as
sophisticated loves to dress up elegant
and feminine
they say that cancers are usually the
most overdressed people in a room and
we're into like classic clean lines I'm
not sure about other cancers but I
wouldn't
myself someone who like goes for like
classic style or like classic
silhouettes all the time I wear a lot of
really weird stuff
I wonder what stitch fix would say about
the clear plastic jeans that said I do
somewhat relate to the overdressed vibe
in that I like a lot of dramatic flair
but also I like to wear a lot of
leggings so I think I'm somewhere in the
middle in terms of this outfit
specifically I think that the silhouette
overall does kind of suit my fashion
sense and this outfit also does check
the comfiest box it's pretty comfortable
and cozy to be honest I feel like I'm
keeping my core warm my soft in size
with this scarf but the the shoes are
really a big old question mark I think
that they were going for they're kind of
like overdressed sophisticated elegant
look with these but my feet were not
made for walking how your feet feel it I
feel like I need a specialized wardrobe
for like chancers who are tall okay yeah
big unwieldy feet
where are my Birkenstocks is the title
of this outfit so my day 3 outfit was
from PopSugar you're so tall and long in
this thing
I am the beige Gumby from the photos on
their website they recommended to me a
statement camel colored overcoat a white
button-down black pants this red
lipstick and these black boots with
heels always heels so of this outfit the
things that I already had were the pants
the boots and the lipstick and then the
jacket and the white button-down are new
it's weird I didn't have a white
button-down in my closet before this I
think I just had like a lot of different
ones that were mostly black in general
they said that Cancerian style is
classic sophisticated and feminine and
they suggested colors like taupe beige
and red which sounds a lot like what
stitch fix set I do feel that besides
the heels this outfit is pretty
comfortable like I'm pretty just like
warm and cool
see under here I think the jacket in
particular has both the sophisticated
vibe and the cozy vibe the coach is very
like a muted Carmen Sandiego I do feel a
little bit like I've got secrets inside
I wouldn't describe my personal fashion
sense as classic sophisticated and
feminine but I do kind of like this
outfit that they suggested to me this is
definitely more dressed up than I would
dress I'm like an everyday basis and I
do feel a little costumey like it's kind
of like bringing me into some type of
character but I like that about it
because I will say that a through-line
of my wardrobe is a little costumey one
of these days you're gonna turn around
used to be naked surprise dressing like
I'm naked for a week
are they also be called getting arrested
for flashing people for a week so my day
for outfit is from Halawa calm which is
like an online magazine and for this
outfit they suggested that I wear a maxi
dress with daring cutouts or a high slit
the description said lots of cutouts
there are a lot of them in the photo on
their website they styled their outfit
with a red clutch and wedges so for this
outfit I already own these wedges but
the dress and the bag are new at least
these aren't like stiletto heels but for
some reason we're always going with the
elevated shoe from what I can tell crabs
don't wear heels so I don't get it I
don't know that's the real litmus they
say that cancers are very emotional
which I agree with but they say that
that emotion translates to wanting
show-stopping pieces head-turning
fashions I think they said primarily
Brown little Angelina Jolie right there
I've been failing for
how it goes I don't completely
understand the jump from emotional to
show-stopping maxi dresses maybe it's
like a dramatic thing like I'm trying to
be dramatic maybe it's Cancerian because
it flows like the water
I do like maxi dresses so that's true I
don't usually go for like intense
cutouts especially not in the boobage
area it's not a lot of coverage there
there aren't too many children at this
park but there are some I'll just put my
bag right here I feel like this is a
dress you couldn't wear to Disneyland
no no rollercoasters if they had
recommended more of a leisure maxi dress
I think it could make sense but with the
dramatic cutouts and the wedges it feels
a little too much like an evening gown
to be Cancerian
in my opinion so my day 5 outfit is from
vogue such a nice day today I'm feeling
so positive and bright so for this
outfit they recommended a white camisole
blouse thingy some patterned leggings
tan low heeled sandals a tan handbag and
opal earrings the things that are mine
are the earrings the top and the shoes
and the things I had to buy are the bag
and a leggings so they actually had a
pretty lengthy article about Cancerian
style and even kind of tried to justify
each item which i thought was cool they
mentioned that cancer is a sign that
loves tradition home and family and I
think that they were saying that the
warm tones of like the yellow and the
beige is kind of remind one of home I
feel like a sunflower photosynthesis and
then they mentioned that this flowing
peplum silhouette is kind of like a
watery fluid look because you know
cancers are a water sign you do look a
little like red a day at the beach
that's gonna say I feel like a little
bit like an umbrella interestingly
enough this is the outfit that made me
feel like a completely different
personality something about this outfit
does make me feel a little bit like a
food blogger like I feel like this
outfit would work well
in an Instagram theme if the theme was
beige and white you got me and then you
got the cappuccino looks like a heart or
butt oh maybe it's the peach emoji
it's got hidden meeting and the hidden
meaning he's but overall I liked some of
these individual items but altogether
the style was just a lot more proper and
preppy than I usually dress news picked
yourself I was too zealously sniffing oh
this one's the best one she's sniffing
like a dog how are you supposed to do it
I don't know my day six outfit was
pieced together from recommendations
from glamour they mentioned specifically
a white button-down yoga pants and very
high heels I apologize if anyone
despises the socks with this outfit but
my toes and my heels are so beat-up that
I honestly just needed some type of
protection literally in my sleep last
night I called out to Tyler I was like
Tyler I have some neosporin for my toes
they mentioned that as soon as you open
a cancers closet you will see a white
button-down funnily enough I had to go
buy this that being said I did use this
white button-down in a lot of the other
outfits this week so it seems like a lot
of people do kind of like throw in a
white button-down with a cancer outfit
the yoga pants are new though and I'm
into that very comfy I've got a lot of
them they introduce the yoga pants as a
comfortable and cozy option because
cancers like comfortable things and
they're the first article to really say
that so I think they get some points for
nailing that one on the head
they then lose some of those points from
putting me in sky-high heels yeah I
don't feel like we can get across the
street fast enough
five I mean you barely made it yeah that
was actually kind of a close call these
heels are mine from a different video
but I definitely don't wear them on the
regular even if they do look kind of
cool this is what I call the blister
struct you'd even do the blister lean or
you can do a blister crab-walk it's
pretty hard to say whether or not this
is my style because it's a pretty
neutral outfit it's just a button-down
black leggings and heels it's not like
you like really bold Reds and I can
easily refute that they're kind of me
like you like neutral things I'm like I
don't hate them yeah they're neutral so
I had spent six days taking a lot of
people's advice on what I should wear as
a cancer zodiac sign but I wanted to
consult an expert so I spoke to miss
mermaid who is an astrologist and
psychic reader based in LA and asked her
what she thought Cancerian style was
like first of all cancer they kind of
want to hide out they kind of want to
blend in they don't want to wear really
bright colors and they also want to be
comfortable they might wear pajamas like
a little later than most folks and
that's actually me so I've been doing
this for a couple of days already and
they've been putting me in a lot of
classic silhouettes like a lot of like
white button-down shirts a few of them
did say comfortable stuff today I'm
wearing yoga pants which I'm excited
yeah totally yoga pants but a lot of
them put me in high heels high heels
doesn't make any sense okay thank you
thank you that's what I was saying oh
you had bunny slippers on right now or
you're barefoot right now that makes way
more sense she first clarified that she
doesn't think that you can define a
person's entire personality or fashion
sense based on their zodiac sign alone
because there's not only 12 people and
if you really want a more complete
understanding of your astrological
tendencies you have to look at your
birth chart which shows where all of the
stars were in the sky when you were born
not just your general zodiac sign an
astrology chart is it's like a big pizza
and it's cut into slices and each slice
is called a house and the first house is
what you look like your body how you
present yourself to the world why you're
gonna wear so apparently you should
really be looking at the constellation
in your first house to evaluate your
zodiac style so we put my birth
information into the website she uses
and got my chart and the more accurate
the minutes are the better and she
noticed that when I was born I had
Aquarius in my first house or as my
rising sign so Aquarius is the rebel
what's gonna be different I don't want
to wear everything that everyone else is
wearing once know why you wanted to do
something experimental wear plastic
pants yes yes
so should I be doing like a combination
like what is this so cancer likes
comfortable stuff yes in pajamas
totally and Aquarius likes weird stuff
yes so together I should be wearing like
weird comfortable pajamas that sounds
like the best thing I could ever wear
honestly so I decided to try out an
Aquarius outfit just for reference so
for my last outfit I went back to the
stitch fix website from day 2 and picked
up there Aquarius look I think in
general aquarius's or query I are
supposed to be pretty like risk-taking
and eccentric and bold with their
fashion choices in this outfit they
recommended a burgundy moto jacket a
black tank top a blue pattern skirt tan
booties and gold hoop earrings so out of
this stuff the tank top and the shoes
are mine and the earrings the jacket and
the skirt are not mine so I wouldn't say
I have a higher percentage of these
things than I did for the cancer stuff
but I do enjoy parts this outfit a lot
in general they recommend for Aquarius
style taking a walk on the wild side
with bold prints and colors and
generally shining they say shine on
Aquarius shine on from what I read about
a query
alien s
I was gonna say it's kind of like squid
ish right cuz that's like so fluffy it's
almost like tentacles I think he won't
like flouncy like a fairy or an angel
yeah
Swedish also it's the fairy of the water
in some ways I did find that this outfit
was more my style than some of the other
outfits this week I did enjoy the no
heel situation but I also really liked
some of these pieces I don't think I
would wear them altogether I think
mostly because of the skirt maybe I'm
not a bold colors or patterns type of
gal but I do like sort of the individual
interesting pieces even though this
outfit isn't really something that I
would usually wear either I am kind of
vibing with like the kookiness there are
kind of like more clothing items to play
with and I do enjoy that alright so that
was my week dressing like my zodiac sign
one thing that stood out to me this week
is how differently these publications
defined cancer style from my
expectations
I personally was harping a lot on
comfort and they were talking a lot
about classic styles and I guess there
is some type of comfort in a classic
look in a sort of tried-and-true way but
in general their recommendations weren't
really how I like to dress and didn't
like speak to something within me that I
didn't know existed before as like oh I
should be dressing like this I think
that the best and closest recommendation
was actually made by Miss mermaid
when she said I should be wearing crazy
pajamas which I'm very down with there
were also some aspects of the Aquarius
style that I really did like I don't
really vibe with the bright colors and
the patterns but I do vibe with the odd
weird pieces so in general I wouldn't
recommend taking these style tips to the
letter as miss mermaid said there aren't
just 12 types of people with 12 specific
fashion senses but in general I think
they're just fun to read to see what
they're gonna say but what isn't fun is
hammertoes and I know because I have
them and they have blisters now thank
