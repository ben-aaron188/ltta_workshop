hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm gonna be mixing all of
my liquid lipsticks together into one
giant mega lipstick so I've previously
mixed my nude solid lipsticks my
foundations and my eyeshadows and
overall the results were surprisingly
good
so I've returned once again for some bad
makeup science in my quest to eventually
complete an entire Franken face of
makeup when I looked at the makeup that
I had yet to mix the largest collection
by far was my liquid lipsticks as you
guys may know I'm a little bit of a
lipstick fiend hoarder and packrat and
liquid lipsticks are no exception now
admittedly doubling back to lipsticks
doesn't help me get there any faster but
I just have so many liquid lipsticks I
just wanted to know what would happen
okay let's bring them in they are the
lipsticks and here are the tools whole
gangs back together again now when i
mixed my nude lipsticks together i
purposely left out the liquid lipsticks
because i didn't think that they would
mix well with the solid ones and also
because I was pretty sure they would
start drying down really quick in fact
I'm not sure if this is gonna work
now I've tested a couple of methods and
contrary to what one might think
you can't just syringe the liquid out of
there cuz it doesn't really pool it kind
of like sticks to the sides of the tube
and you can't exactly scrape out the
insides with a different tool or
anything because you'll probably break
the top of the tube like this little
plastic part right here which is what I
did to this one so here's how I'm gonna
try and do this I'm gonna use these
syringes and scrape a little lipstick
from the brush onto the plastic tube
portion of these syringes and then
squirt them into the receiving tube if
this sounds like a convoluted plan it is
so let's try it and if it doesn't work
we'll be filming the Franken highlighter
video later tonight okay
let's begin who shall be our first
victim Oh young Kylie all right so I'm
gonna begin with this one which is the
Kylie cosmetics Velvet liquid lipstick
in the color
rosy I'm gonna swatch it first and then
let's see if we can pull this off
alright let's start trying to scrape it
off right here now I've got this amount
of liquid lipstick up there I'm gonna
use this plunger and then try and squirt
it out into here the amount of lipstick
that's gonna come in here it's gonna be
miniscule isn't it oh isn't it all right
here we go I don't have quite enough to
drop it out I need more
Kylie damn it don't you know what I'm
trying to do over here alright let's see
oh some sprayed out oh did you see that
there's definitely a little log in there
there's also a bit of a squirt
this is gonna take a while isn't it
there are these two in here that I can
just squirt in without doing all the
syringe stuff these are the Too Faced
melted chocolate liquefied liquid
lipsticks so maybe I should squirt these
in just to get like a base to kind of
start working off of there we go
that's some good content that's a good
one that was our first good one
alright heading back to the syringe
method we had a couple of easy-peasy but
getting back to whatever the fuck I'm
doing over here we're learning as we go
because urgent I hope this isn't what
surgeons feel like yeah that's kind of a
colonoscopy yeah oh my god that weren't
that was something I think that was
mostly the last lipstick that we put in
the Kylie one I think maybe I should
separate the syringes a little bit more
by like tone not by the individual
colors I don't have that many but like
nude red stark colors you know separate
them a lot more we got a lot of these
syringes you might as well use them
lambu bhavati about a pepper to you I'm
hoping that the skinnier syringe will
get us like a little bit more of that
good push in I just blew myself
damnit no I'm taking some lipstick off
no I am Sisyphus this is my rock what
the actual f but you know what I'm
amazed that anything came out of that
syringe this may work it may take hours
but it may work alright so I'm
designating this syringe just like my
purple and blue syringe and then I'm
gonna use these ones as my nude and red
basically so I'm gonna blow through a
couple right now I've got a lot over
here as you guys can see one thing I'm
happy about is I don't think they're
drying
in there quite yet so we've got some
time to work you look so concentrated do
you say constipated no I said
concentrated but yeah this thing is a
little constipated right now how many
more of these do we have to do you have
the hoarding problem and now we're
paying the price oh this is fun alright
so next I'm gonna do lip sense which is
the 18 hour lipstick Judy's gonna melt
the bottle
maybe yeah that is nail polish the wands
like really covered already but the tube
is pretty empty
alright did something kind of silly I
put three similar colors in at the same
time into this bigger syringe just to
see if we can't start speeding this up
just a little bit oh my god it's took at
the top my my my doesn't that look
appetizing it looks like a eighty sci-fi
monster it kind of looks like a wound to
me it's very placental I'm hoping that
once we mix it all together though it'll
look a bit better but like this like
pre-mixed state isn't awesome
I feel like filling up these medium
sized syringes with a couple of liquid
lipsticks in the same color range has
really been the key to like get a good
squirt out of there so right now we're
out of like pretty slow but not snail's
pace we're Turtles oh that's so pretty
oh it's getting stuck we have very
little window left inside with which to
see you know what's going on in there so
I'm just gonna keep dropping these in
Tyler's making a pizza so next time you
see me yet hopefully I'll hot pizza
that's coming it's 140 a.m. the things
we do for science where's the pizza it's
coming all right I'm gonna Forge right
ahead into some nudes we have a lot of
these things your pizza yeah really yeah
I turn the oven on this time oh my god
ty you are a lifesaver
ha yeah it's got a brother roof of your
mouth worth it alright I'm ready for
this one you ready for this one
oh shit so with the pizza came our first
casualty so I'm gonna use this little
stick to pick it up and try and put it
back in I'd say we salvage that as I sit
here and the hours get later and by
later I mean earlier I'm struck by how
many cents there are in the room
right now all the liquid lipsticks so
many of them smell like vanilla and then
we've also got the pizza going and then
crusty going who just we've got it all
going the tube does kind of have like a
funky design it does look a little bit
like a lava lamp if your lava lamp
expired okay belly button is it in any
er now Dee that's a nasty all right I'm
about 2/3 to 3/4 of the way through it's
hard to tell exactly how much is in
there because I've long since not been
able to see through the tube on the
sides I'm like every time I drop more in
there it seems like bubble up so I'm
almost a little bit worried about it
overflowing but we are so close to the
end that I just desperately want to get
them all in there we've got a few
metallic ones left
he's bronzy Goldy ones and then I got a
couple in there that are like silvery
metallics with like a black a gray and a
white so we're ending with a bang this
is the grand finale of this firework
show I feel like the sun's about to rise
oh it definitely is okay so we are
finally on our last batch I just want to
thank everyone who helped me get to this
point you guys Tyler Krusty the pizza I
just want to say a big screw you to my
former self who bought all these yeah
you need to buy less lipsticks
oh yes and it's a weird twisty one to
finish it out all right here is all of
my liquid lipsticks in one bottle I
wonder how many there are let's see
85 86 87 88 we've got 88 liquid
lipsticks in here so I think we should
mix this up put it on my lips and see
how it is I got a scrape a little bit on
the inside of the bottle just gotta get
all that stuff on the sides off I feel
like I've mixed up almost as much as I
can
there's some on the sides it's still a
little stratified and like unmixed but I
actually can't reach it with the wooden
stick or with my little wand or anything
a safety pin that I randomly stuck in
there so maybe if I just like shake it
up like this it'll just come out and it
doesn't seem to be doing anything at all
so that means that this is our Franken
liquid lipstick a Franken matte if it
dries matte I think we should swatch it
and see how it looks I mean that's a
pretty color cuz it definitely has some
like of those brownie nude elements but
it also has some
of like the purples that were brought in
by the blues greens and reds all right
so it's 4:30 in the morning so let's try
this thing on and see how it looks it
feels very moisturizing like it feels
very light and slippery it smells almost
like nothing which is very strange
because so many vanilla scented things
went into it I mean the color is nice I
really like the color actually a lot I
only really put about one coat of the
stuff on and it seems to be like really
opaque from the start let me see what
happens if I try to cover up my butthole
lip which is if you guys don't know what
I call the inner waterline of the lip
from which lipstick often fades that's
gonna be all righty doesn't it okay so
this is what the Franken liquid lipstick
looks like right now I'm gonna go to bed
and then tomorrow I'm gonna wear this
all day and see how it lasts and how it
does but my first take besides the fact
that it's all over my teeth is that it
looks pretty good and also we finally
made it alright so it is the next day or
this just later it's later
I slept I'm alive here we are and I've
done the rest of my makeup so I am ready
to wear our Frank and Matt for the rest
of the day so as you can see it's still
not like completely mixed there like
some colors that are just at the edge
that I just don't know how to get
they're just gonna live there maybe
eventually they'll infuse who knows
alright let's put it on oh wow I got a
lot on my finger I got to be careful I'm
wearing a white shirt for a different
video I obviously don't have a lip liner
to assist me so I'm just kind of like
going with it just the same as yesterday
it's very light on the face and it does
feel kind of slippery it looks a little
wrinkly it's it's not super smooth but
you know I've never been known for
having smooth lips there's something
about it that's just like so much
formula packed in every swipe it's not
uncomfortable but it does feel like I in
one swipe applied like four coats of
liquid lipstick the color is by far my
favorite part so far the color is
awesome I'm gonna go out and go on with
my day and we'll check in when and if
anything happens with this let's go so
I've had the lipstick on for probably
like 30 minutes I would say yes and when
I had it on late last night or early
this morning I don't
one of the two it felt like it was
drawing down pretty Matt but actually
it's kind of staying in a weird middle
ground when I put my lips together
they're kind of tacky not sticky but
they're like a little bit like almost
dry nail polish like right after you get
a manicure and it's dangerous all right
so it's been about an hour and a half
and I think the lipstick is still going
strong the thing that confuses me the
most about this lipstick is that I don't
see any glitter or metallic in there and
I did put some in so where it went I'm
not sure but I did get some coffee for a
little bit of a smear test so let's take
a sip I've literally I've been waiting
transferred I felt it sticking to the
cup I was like ooh yep that's gonna
leave a mark
I couldn't really expect for it to be
transfer proof after the amount of
velvet and satin lipsticks I put it
there hopefully it doesn't transfer
around my face or off of my lips I'm
okay if I ruin other things that aren't
my white shirt okay so I think I'm
finally done with my coffee and I think
my lipstick is finally done massacring
the top I think you can see maybe a
little bit of fading on the bottom but I
would say that with the amount of
lipstick that looks like it's on here
this is looking pretty good
definitely not re application worthy but
I do see it fading ever so slightly all
right so it's been about six hours since
I put the lipstick on I think I've found
some sparkles I'm finally sitting down
to dinner and I'm gonna subject my
lipstick to some oily pizza yes yes
first bite in what happened anything I
beat the taste good it looks pretty good
what witchcraft is it the second time
we've eaten pedes in this video I forgot
that we piss yesterday well it is
morning
well like the one true ring it can only
be destroyed from whence it was forged
you're only halfway doing your piece so
let's see if we actually can destroy it
okay so I'm done with dinner I eat four
pieces of pizza in total and my lipstick
is still on it's definitely not perfect
I think the butthole is finally being
exposed but it is mostly on and it is
somehow not all over my face it
definitely suffered a few blows at the
hands of a napkin that I think is gone
now but overall it's still alive
all right so it is about nine hours
after I applied this lipstick and I'm
finally ready to go to bed and take it
off I would say that this Franken matte
definitely impressed me after a full day
of wearing coffee and pizza it's
definitely like coming off but it is
still mostly on my face even if it is a
little bit worn away and a little bit
flaky the buckle is definitely making an
appearance but it made a late appearance
it did not come early there are
definitely a couple of cons though
number one being how long it took and
how difficult it was to make this thing
another thing I don't really like about
it is how transferee it seems to be not
like around my face but obviously like
on two cups
on two napkins and also just like when
you kind of just like grab this if you
get any extra formula on your hands it
gets everywhere but besides those couple
of things I think it's pretty good also
I came up with a few color names
number one is Dumbledore's pajamas
number two is Barney's pelt and number
three is Buffy the butthole Slayer the
the last one has nothing to do with the
color I just it popped in my head and I
thought I would say it out loud so let
