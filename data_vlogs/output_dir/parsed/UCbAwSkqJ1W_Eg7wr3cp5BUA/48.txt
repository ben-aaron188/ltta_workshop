hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm going to be picking out
a full face of makeup blindfolded a few
weeks ago I filmed a similar video where
I picked out an entire outfit
blindfolded and in the comments a few of
you guys have requested that I do the
same thing with makeup now at first I
thought that it would be really
difficult because makeup relies so
heavily on the color choices but then I
thought maybe through deductive
reasoning touch and my knowledge of how
makeup products are usually laid out in
a store we might actually be able to
pull this off so my plan is basically to
pick out one of everything that I need
for a full face of makeup and just to
keep the experiment honest whatever I
choose something as is how I'm going to
wear it like if I pick out a concealer
as lipstick I have to wear that
concealer as lipstick I feel like last
time when I was picking out an outfit I
was hoping that fate would bring me to
some new styles but this time I'm mostly
focused on just getting the products
right and we'll see what fate has in
store for me in terms of how it looks
okay let's go okay so I'm allowed to
pick out a full face of makeup products
blindfolded a big shout out to NYX for
letting us film in their store today so
what I need today are some base products
like foundation a concealer some face
powders like blush contour highlighter
some I products like eyeliner eye shadow
mascara some eyebrows and some lip stuff
alright give me the basket thank you
don't waste thing around is it just
right behind me right okay walking into
the store I don't know what I think just
telling the world it's good oh this is
what its gonna do it's gonna help me
find this thing this is probably a
display that shows like new stuff oh
sorry did I just bug open oh that's the
wall I thought I just bumped butts with
someone I was like oh okay these feel
like new products I'm not gonna open
them up I think I'm gonna pass on these
I think this is gonna be a level of
difficulty I have not
get reached okay so I'm gonna keep going
what I'm hoping for is like a display
with individual products so I can open
things up swatch it and feel the
packaging and that type of thing
what on earth oh I think that these are
refills for eyeshadow palettes because I
can't imagine what else they would be I
don't think I want these but based on
the fact I think that these are like
eyeshadow refills
I think I'm near I stuff so that's a
good first clue let me go down alright
we've got is this a new product or a
tester that's a tester oh yeah this is
definitely a palette I can feel like the
dividers now I guess the question is do
I want to be getting a single eyeshadow
or do I want to be getting like more of
like a little palette so I can like have
some flexibility resection oh this feels
like a small size palette I'm so fast I
don't want to spend too much time on any
one type of product especially because
at some point after I think that I've
identified what it is like I can't do
much more beyond that so I'm pretty sure
this is a six pan eyes shadow palette it
isn't the first thing I picked up it is
the second thing and I'm feeling pretty
good about it so I'm gonna go with this
will you help me grab the real product
not the tester oh yeah sorry I think we
don't have that look they don't have it
no this is not in stock so I'm you know
back to the wall I suppose
oh is this a similar product I think
this will work it's the same thing I
just picked up but in a different color
all right I'm putting this into my
basket one down a lot to go so I'm gonna
keep going this way and try to find more
eye things aha these feel like pencils
yep that could be an eyeliner pencil
usually I go for liquid eyeliner but
it's a good sign that these pencils are
here because that means that I'm in the
right direction
they could be lip liners but I'm going
with the idea that they're eyeliners
it's hard for me to tell what these
things are
oh that is a eyeliner marker isn't it
yeah
we're getting closer where did this come
from help me can I come with you why I
want to know where I just was so I can
keep looking from there my best guess as
to what oh oh there's a wall here yeah
there's your whiskey-tango-foxtrot right
there Oh could this be this feels like
the right amount of shaft length to to
because I feel like with the liquid
eyeliner you need a long brush and
you've got like a small amount of
product at the bottom so let's see if
I'm right oh oh I feel nothing there's
no brush alright so I guess I'm gonna
have to gamble to be fair this does feel
like it could be eyeliner product over
here it feels like a little bit watery a
little bit sticky Oh are these colorful
I feel like they're colorful because
there are so many of them next to each
other they feel like usually if it was
like a black eyeliner there'd be like -
okay well I guess I've been led to these
colorful eyeliners I think I'm gonna go
with this one just because it's kind of
like right in the middle so I'm hoping
that it is a middle-of-the-road choice
it feels like I felt like this whole
display already it's like keep like
trying to feel around for mascara and
for eyebrow products but I keep picking
up the same things so I'm gonna go
around the wall and see what's on the
other side oh oh we're here we've
arrived is this lip stuff no it feels a
little too skinny to be lip stuff Oh
what's this I think that this could be a
brow product yeah yeah let me see what's
on the other side oh wait what I would
thought this was gonna be a spoolie what
is this okay I thought that was a brow
product the other side threw me off
entirely right I'm feeling around more
just hoping to find a mascara and a brow
oh this could be a mascara these feel
like the right size to be mascaras
there's no brush at the end but that
feels like mascara that's really all I
got I choose this mascara I think it's
mascara I think all right where is
eyebrows I feel like these could be brow
products but it's kind of hard for me to
tell I'm like looking for like a good
sign that this is deaf
brow products oh this one gave itself
away there's a spoolie at the end of
this I'm guessing these go from light to
dark I'm gonna go with the second to
darkest so this is the eyebrow pencil I
chose finally found that spoolie all
right
that's my eye stuff now I'm gonna go
forth and try and find more things oh
these are brushes brushes brushes
brushes oh let me see what this thing is
this could be lips oh no but this is
quite chunky to be a lip this product is
mystifying me I don't think I'm gonna
take a gamble on this guy because I
think it's too confusing what else do we
have
nope that's the same thing I don't want
that Oh large palettes is there a tester
for this thing that's it okay there's
three pans and they're quite big I think
that this is like a contouring palette
or I don't want this guy but I I know
where I am now I think so these are
intriguing to me because these feel like
double sided something something I think
that these could be like highlighter
contours it's one two three four five
six if we've got six colors for face
products I'm not gonna be the lightest
one probably so I'm gonna go for a
number two out of six I'm gonna go for
this one
all right so right now you all right
next to the register hi is there anyone
waiting in line there's no one waiting
in line you can walk right through ah
display right there that would be an
easy one to knock over yeah that would
have been bad we wouldn't have been
invited as we saw they're very friendly
to us right now but that could change I
could shower very quickly all right I'm
gonna just do like a kind of like a
personal space barrier thing and then
just oh this is the wall again so if I'm
right and I already got like a contour
and highlight little thingy what I need
from like a face area would be like a
blush and like a highlighter if what I
think is right that I think that that's
what I want
you don't saying based on what I'm
feeling I don't think I'm in the lip
section I think I'm near like more face
powders this is not a tester but this
feels like about the right size to be
like a blush I do have a couple NYX
blushes and I do feel this little like
opener I think it's might be the same
product now it is nearly impossible for
me to figure out like what color
anything is and by nearly I mean
completely I am just gonna go for this
one this is the blush hopefully is that
I choose I feel like the only way I'll
be able to distinguish a like
highlighter is if it's a liquid one so I
wonder if there is like a little bit of
like a liquid highlight that we could
find mm-hmm oh no if that's wrong
what are these this could either be like
a primer situation or it could be like a
liquid highlight reward of some type I
guess it could be a foundation I guess
it could be a really dewy foundation all
right how many of them are there but
three four doesn't feel like foundations
would only have four I feel like there's
a good chance this is either a liquid
bronzer blush or highlighter a lot of
for colors I'm gonna go for color number
two all right so it feels like the wall
is like my saviors so I'm gonna keep on
going down the wall and feel what else I
can feel oh the land of tubes could I be
near a foundation area I think I could
and there do seem to be a lot of them so
this could be like the shade range that
I'm looking for let's count them and see
one two three sixteen seventeen
19:20 there's more so there's 30 of them
I think that this has got to be
foundation what else would there be 30
of in a row that's like this size like
that's like a tube like this kind of
going with like the same way I picked
out the contour like I would say like
I'm definitely not 15 15s dab in the
middle I'm not that tan maybe I put
myself at like number eight
hopefully foundation hopefully somewhat
of the right color I'm gonna just keep
feeling along this wall see if we can't
find a concealer of some kind I feel
like these are like little tubes I think
these are gonna have to be concealers
let me see if I can find like a big
display of them so I can try and do the
counting method again these feel like
maybe these are the concealers that go
with my foundation because they've got
the like tubing aspect 1 2 3
18 19 I must have missed one there must
be 20 out of 20 I'm gonna pick up number
6 I don't think I'm 10 that's like true
tan medium and like maybe number 6 is
right because it's like a little bit
more medium than number 5 so all we have
left is lips so I'm gonna go out into
the great beyond and see if I can find
anything any any lip products of any
kind oh I'm sorry
I touched something oh interesting i I
kind of like touched my hand like this
and I got nervous but I think that these
are lip sticks I feel like fate has
brought me to this display 5 6 7 I think
I'm gonna go for this one
I feel like picking like number four out
of seven gives me a good shot at it
being like a middle-of-the-road type of
color
when in doubt for things that aren't
like supposed to my skin color I'm
picking like right in the middle the
last thing we need I think that is the
last thing that we need so we're gonna
go check out by these guys and then I'm
gonna see what I have to work with and
then we're gonna put them on my face
tomorrow and try and make it a makeup
look oh it's like a whole new world in
here okay so this is what I got
yes and it's in order so this is your
eyeshadow okay there we go six pans this
is your eyeliner oh it's blue it is very
blue that's your mascara eyebrow pencil
this is your contour blush that maybe a
little bit red but workable so this was
like a liquid highlighter it does look
maybe like a little bit
cheechee but it's a highlighter then
next was the foundation right yes okay
so oh four point five soft sand it looks
gonna dark in the bottle but with this
stuff I feel like we could probably make
it work so that's your concealer then
okay cool concealer got it this is your
lipstick oh it's orange it's a metallic
copper Wow okay interesting the thing
I'm most excited about is that I seem to
have chosen all the products as the
right products but you know the color
combos are gonna be they're gonna be a
choice
okay so what is the next day I've been
editing most of the day and I just
uploaded a video so I'm finally ready to
put on some makeup and go explore the
world the first thing I'm gonna start
with is this micro brow pencil in the
color espresso alright so let me get in
with this spoolie oh yeah here is the
tip of the micro brow pencil pretty
brown pretty brownish that's okay though
we can definitely work with this kind of
a soft brow romantic almost like a
caterpillar in heat maybe I should have
gone for the the last color maybe I
needed that like true darkest black but
it's close enough that it doesn't look
crazy okay so I did my second brow
overall with both of them done I think
it's looking pretty decent especially
from far away can't tell so I'm gonna
move on to the eyeshadow this is my
eyeshadow palette it's called the lid
lingerie doesn't have a name I think
it's just called lid lingerie alright
that's fine
I feel like off the bat these shades are
kind of calling my name we just gotta
think ahead to the blue eyeliner so I
feel like beige and purple and brown
will work well so looks like I've got
all my eyeshadow colors on my eyes so
I'm just gonna blend just gonna blend
the shit out of it windshield wiper I
don't think I blended it perfectly but
it's close so I'm going to dive it
straight into the complexion product so
I picked this stay matte but not flat
foundation in the color soft sand and
then I also got for my complexion this
gotcha Covered concealer in the color
beige I love me some beige some
parchment anything that implies
something that you could find at the
post office oh yeah
yeah Oh interesting it's lighter than it
looked in the tube all right and then
here is the foundational oh yeah a
little on the tan side for sure I think
if I just blend it together I think
it'll probably work yeah kind of just
making me look alive like foundation
matches have been worse they've
definitely been better but they've been
worse okay so next is highlight and
contour this is it it's called the
sculpting highlight face duo okay so I'm
gonna take my contouring in and do a
little sculpting mm that's uneven that's
unfortunate
so next I'm gonna go in with my
highlighting side I'm just gonna boom oh
you have that clown contour though I
mean highlight it's been a while since I
did liquid highlight and contour but I
feel like this is generally the vibe and
then we shall blend that is an intense
contour but we're going with it so next
I'm gonna like set everything down some
setting powder just realize I forgot my
liquid highlighter but um we'll put that
on after this okay so next I'm gonna do
eyeliner which is this vivid bright
eyeliner in the color vivid sapphire she
looks quite blue but um let's see how it
is on the face well I got some blue on
my boobs can you see it there it is now
that that's there I think we can put it
on the eyes okay that is very blue but
it's kind of fun I probably done better
eyeliner in my life but I feel like
actually it works pretty well with the
like sort of neutral eye alright so now
that my eyeliner is done I'm gonna brush
off my baking powder but before I forget
let's do the mascara okay cool next up
let's do blush I chose this HD blush in
the color pink the town do I own this
already yes I already on it there it is
there they both are good let's just do a
little bit of blush like right here
let's saw smiley oh yeah look like a
little uh cherubim and then I kind of
forgot about this my liquid highlighter
born to glow alright so here's this
little pinkish still on the pink side so
maybe it'll pair well with pink the town
I know you're not supposed to put like
liquid stuff on top of powders but I'll
happening so fast there it is there it
is oh yeah so you didn't look so bad
and then last but certainly not least is
the lipstick oh wow oh this look turned
from ravenclaw to like patriotic real
fast don't I look like someone's like
fourth of July tutorial okay with the
addition of the lipstick I think this is
our entire look so I'm gonna take my
hair down and let's go to some different
lighting and see how we like it so this
is my blindfolded makeup look
I'm overall pretty pleased with it like
it definitely could have been worse I
don't think I would wear these things
all together again but I think that
everything that I got is usable by
itself and I actually like the eye look
as it I wasn't so sure about the blue
eyeliner to begin with but I actually
really like that and like the matte
neutral shadows together like you just
look at this part it's interesting
because it seems like the items that
could have gone the most wrong like the
complexion products actually ended up
being okay
and it was more like the eyes in the
lips which have more creative liberties
that ended up putting the look more into
the over-the-top category but all in all
it was a fun challenge and I can
definitely see myself using all of the
individual products by themselves in
some ways it was more successful than
the blindfolded outfit challenge because
I ended up with a lot of stuff that I
wouldn't normally get
ever this is yeah it looks like Sofia
