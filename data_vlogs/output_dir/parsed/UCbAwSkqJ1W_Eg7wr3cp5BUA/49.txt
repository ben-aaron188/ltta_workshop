hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm going to be dressing
like we did 30 years ago
in 1987 1987 was the year that brought
us the Princess Bride full house nike
air maxes 21 Jump Street and the births
of Snooki hillary duff and phil lester
from Corey Feldman to Corey Haim 1987
was a year of fighting for a right to
party and learning to never put baby in
a corner while President Reagan was
demanding that mr. Gorbachev tear down
this wall people were getting rickrolled
for the very first time in regards to
what we were wearing it was a year of
shoulder pads converse sneakers bubble
hem dresses acid-washed denim and holy
feet this hair in fact everywhere I
looked I found epic curled permed
quaffed and crimped 80s hair and for
this video I felt like the complexity of
these hairstyles were outside of the
range of my ability so I recruited
Kaylee Melissa a hair stylist and
youtuber to aid me in my quest to
appease the 80s hair gods so with some
assistance and after consulting a few
votes
Seventeen's and heavy metal magazines I
think I've managed to put together three
outfits that represent some of the
iconic looks of the time in general I'm
gonna be focusing mostly on American
fashion though from what I can tell it
seems like 80s style hid the whole world
pretty hard so 1987 what happened and
what we wore so my first outfit is an
homage to the glam metal bands groupies
and audiences of the year this is not my
motorcycle
but it could be 1987 was huge for glam
metal which had been an emerging music
scene during the earlier part of the
decade but exploded in popularity with
Bon Jovi's 1986 album slippery when wet
overall this look combines elements from
several 87 acts including the poisoned
dollies vixen Doro Pesch from warlock
and Joan Jett and also unintentionally a
little bit of Michael Jackson
yeah we're Connie moonwalk you got to
work on it
this outfit includes slouchy boots with
chains these pleather leggings this lace
corset slash bustier thingy an
embellished leather jacket and
asymmetric accessories like these
earrings and gloves
they'd be hard to get off women for my
makeup I went with purple eye shadow
dark pencil eyeliner and hot pink
lipstick glam metal was also known as
hair metal and for good reason oh wow
I'm a little - yeah let's get you away
from that
yeah that's an ozone depleting right
there yeah sorry ozone for this look
Kaylee and I went for a crimped and
teased masterpiece with feathery bangs
we're first going to be starting with
this hair piece this is gonna go on top
of your head and it's going to give you
that bang and like a feathery look that
was so popular especially for the heavy
metal girls you need those short layers
right now it's just like a really bad
toupee you are every uncle at every
wedding ever in the 80s then we'll go
out to curling your hair super tight and
then we're gonna tease everything out
lightnings gonna get big and of course
hairspray to death perfect long straight
hair had been a popular style for
everyone throughout the 1970s but
starting with the punk movement Rock
hairstyles started to skew more vertical
as people rebelled against the natural
look of hippie hair and by the 80s we
had this to me it's almost a Renaissance
II like it reminds me of kind of charles
ii of england circa 1690 you look regal
another thing that defines glam metal
style is its relationship with its
spiritual predecessor glam rock have you
ever even touched a guitar
which heavily featured futuristic looks
exaggerated makeup glitter and an
emphasis on androgyny these androgynous
tendencies were a little more
cutting-edge and subversive in the 70s
but by the late 80s it was everywhere
what song you playing
and I'm like
overall this outfit is extremely fun you
listen you're gonna need an air guitar
but I do feel kind of like I'm wearing a
costume or performing in the musical
Cats for some reason
I don't think that there's much about
this outfit that's in style in 2017
except for maybe the leather jacket
everything else is a little found in the
back of your parents closet
the pleather what is it but that doesn't
mean I think it couldn't or shouldn't
come back in style because I had a good
time so for my second outfit I
shoulder-padded
up for a more office wear look inspired
by all the ladies who enter the
workforce during this decade
I'm City Lady Cities mine that City the
80s saw the culmination of a lot of
societal changes that led to women
taking more and more positions in
previously male-dominated fields
everything the light touches Simba is in
office that you could be working in in a
1984 New York Times article sociologist
Andrew hacker reported that from 1960 to
1983 the percentage of female lawyers
rose from 2 to 15 percent and the
percentage of jobs held by women in
banking and financial management rose
from 9 to 39 percent over that same time
period is that your work laughs yeah for
this outfit I chose these almond toad
white heels pantyhose a wool skirt this
wide white belt a plain long-sleeve
t-shirt and this oversized blazer
couldn't see you over my shoulder pad
there actually turned round I was like
oh what this the shoulder heavy blazer
was a key piece of clothing in 87
fashion I challenge you to poke it
oh wow yeah it's like a football pad as
women in office jobs adopted
shoulder-padded power suits to match
their male coworkers women everywhere
started donning Blazers with similar
shoulder bulk as everyday street wear it
seems like both with women in offices
and also with teenage girls in high
schools menswear as women's wear was
like a big thing unlike a true Power
Suit my jacket and skirt don't match but
that seems to have been an acceptable
iteration off of the blazer look I just
wanted to make sure I was wearing
something bright because colorful
clothing was in red in particular was
noted as being First Lady Nancy Reagan
signature color to pair with the large
shoulders we also had to have a curly
perm ass hairstyle with no apparent part
the reason why seemingly everyone's hair
in the 80s was so large is a complex
mystery that I don't think will ever
fully understand but one possible reason
is that we needed to balance out all of
the large clothing we were wearing if
you didn't have a floopy head of hair to
pair with these shoulder pads your head
would look tiny
they spent probably hours on their hair
but nobody did their eyebrows in this
particular look I felt very much like
share from moonstruck in fact it's a
miracle that I didn't smack Tyler across
the face while wearing it snap out of it
for my makeup look I chose brown eye
shadow prominent blush and peachy pinky
lipstick in general this look is a
fairly muted aesthetic just cuz I copied
some
in the magazines but I made sure to get
my blush all the way to the hairline
just
people were very nice to me in this
outfit and I think that's because I
reminded a lot of them of their mothers
there was a guy in a truck from here
across the street was like idling and he
looked at me just like I'm smiling like
you're either his mom or just like some
lady named Ruth Cheryl I did Oh Cheryl
yeah I don't think shoulder pads or this
silhouette in general is very in style
right now but I would definitely Rock a
shoulder pad today maybe not in this
Swedish pattern but I'm down for the
insert
so for my third outfit I went for a full
on denim wearing teen girl at Mulvey
where's the radio show am i kidding I
know exactly where the Radio Shack is
next to the port I don't think we could
make an 80s video without some acid wash
jeans and in this outfit I'm wearing
acid wash on my legs and my arms and my
torso acid wash was fucking everywhere
now in 1987 jeans could be bought
pre-distressed
or acid washed at a premium but many
people including us decided to acid wash
their jeans themselves
she left her jeans in the acid a little
too long the technique we found told us
to wrap up our jeans and rubber bands
and dunk them in a bleach and water
solution mmm smells good underneath my
acid wash I'm wearing a white t-shirt
with an abstract pattern some bright
pink converse all-stars and as a nod to
the queen of bowler hats herself teen
pop idol Debbie Gibson this medium
brimmed black hat to me this outfit
reads a hundred percent like Robin
sparkles
well actually I'm pretty sure Robin
sparkles was inspired by these gals
Debbie Gibson and Tiffany Darwish but to
me this outfit is Robin sparkles through
and through
which just generally means teen pop
musician known for performing at
shopping centers come on just come
let's go one potential reason for the
mall singer phenomenon was the growing
interest amongst retailers to reach
Generation X or kids tweens and teens
bored from about 1965 to 1980 brands
focused on reaching this market through
celebrities most notably pop stars on
MTV and so they brought the pop singers
to perform literally outside of their
stores I don't want to get kicked out of
the small because we've already been
picked out of one long nearby yeah
that's gonna happen for my hair we went
for a somewhat poofy shoulder length
style with bangs oh yeah blue blue blue
and for my makeup I chose a yellowish
eyeshadow with pencil eyeliner inspired
by this look here maybe not while you
working with bright eyeshadows you can
see your eyes underneath the bangs and
bright pink lipstick I also went a
little accessories crazy with this look
opting for white hoop earrings white and
pink bracelets and this blue watch
another must-have accessory for the
acid-wash clad teen of 1987 was an
acid-wash clad partner
despite the dragging that Justin and
Britney received after the 2001 VMAs
back in 87 couples in matching denim
were the toast of many fashion magazines
or at least Jean company ads so I
figured if I was gonna pull off this
outfit I was gonna take Tyler down with
me
now I didn't give him head to toe
acid-wash instead we channeled a mash-up
of the denim partner look with a dash of
the UK rock band a flock of seagulls tie
your hair is barely moving I can feel it
it's like a sail I think it's like
antenna
though the lead singer of a flock of
seagulls seems to have rocked this
hairstyle throughout the 80s the 90s
sitcom friends places one of their main
characters Candler Bing in this hair
specifically in 1987 between bats and
their greatest hits compilation album
coming out the same year it was a good
enough excuse for me to have Kaylee give
Tyler this dude is supposed to just sit
between my nose my eye you know I think
part of the purpose is to impair vision
of at least one eye yes gosh yeah
besides the seagull Nest hair and the
acid-wash Tyler is also wearing a blue
muscle t-shirt and bright yellow
converse all-stars mostly I just wanted
to put him in that damn hairstyle as I
throw this outfit how's my hair
great okay so those were my 1987 outfits
all in all it was really fun trying to
style outfits around the 1987 aesthetic
the 80s are an amazing decade and though
I think some of the styles are pretty
inexplicable I'm very glad they happened
I also greatly admire anyone who lived
through the 80s and did their hair like
that every single day props
mad props I would say pretty much none
of the 1987 looks that we tried out this
week are in style today maybe acid-wash
a little bit in terms of like distressed
denim men do look similar do the same
color and maybe like a leather jacket
here there but everything else is is not
quite back in yet if I had my way though
I would definitely bring back the
shoulder pads maybe not in a blazer form
but you know just in general the head to
toe acid-washed look and maybe even a
Debbie Gibson hat here or there and also
if I really had my way I would have
Tyler wear that flock of seagulls hair
all the time it's definitely out there
but I feel like he pulled it off as well
as anyone else possibly cooked yep I
like that shot nailed it you look like a
pokemon trainer
