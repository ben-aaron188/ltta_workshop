this is like the least sexual adult
playdate of all time or just how you're
actually playing the Thals it's fun this
looks like a panel at VidCon hello
friends and welcome to another video
today I'm here with Shane Dawson and we
are going to be giving dolls tiny
makeovers now Shane you like to do a lot
of tiny things right you like to make
tiny stuff
I like to feel like a giant at all times
mm-hmm it's great for my self-esteem and
I know you like dolls well I saw these
videos on YouTube that were like doll
repainting videos where people will like
just completely wash away all the
characteristics of a given doll and then
like make them a custom doll like paint
the face redo the hair do everything you
sent me some really creepy ones and I
didn't respond right away because I was
like on a plane or something and then
you got scared then you took it too far
but you're here now and I think that
we're gonna attempt that today see what
we can do see what we can make with our
hands so we have a couple of dolls and a
lot of equipment we've done some
research so we've got a few different
things we can pretty much trick out we
can pimp these dolls however we want you
met research on me hey I did a lot of
research and I know exactly the doll you
want we've a couple of things I think
you might like oh okay cool let's bring
out the dolls
you can pick also whichever one you want
oh my god they look like dead bodies on
CSI
SVU yes but there's a pretty standard
like Monster High dolls cuz apparently
like that's what's in nowadays this is
like Barbies not cool anymore like these
guys are cool I think okay she says that
she can't see her reflection in the
mirror I'm jealous
shyona yeah oh my god okay we have to
get into it her hair is nice well
there's a couple bald spots but hey you
get yours out so quick
yeah I think mine's gonna be pretty like
I feel like mine's like you know she's
all that at the moment were they like
glasses off like it remember Princess
Diaries when she takes off her unibrow
and becomes beautiful yeah but I also
kind of want to blow her with the
blowtorch swinging for your life bitch
we'll do that next time okay cool so I
mean we have these dolls and they have
like their specific backstories but
basically like what we would do to begin
is remove all trappings of their former
lives and then their hair as well Wow
yep my girl can't wait to get naked
she's so excited for her makeover so in
these like dollar repainting videos like
they do a lot of like dismembering to
like get to the end product so we will
get to fulfill some of your like
murdering desires okay good yeah
Lyons hair is falling out I think she's
stressed nothing to do with the fact
that you ripped the bow out of her hair
violently she's like I don't need this
this looks a great deal girl oh yeah
this is my hair does this thing really
work so they're naked now we actually
have things that will preserve their
decency while we do this makeover oh
I'll make over chairs I'm gonna scream
if I had a rat I would give these I want
to meet the woman or a man that made
this I think that they're in jail
laughing all the way to the bank cuz I
bought a bunch of these things so we
have ropes because this is supposed to
simulate like a spa trip you know
they're renewing themselves they're you
know getting a little makeover they're
gonna have a great time gossiping about
all the undead hotties so now that we've
you know dressed them and put them on
these all spa chairs I think we should
completely wipe their faces off done so
we're gonna be using q-tips and a bottle
of acetone do you have a vision for what
you want to do I don't know now I'm
starting to feel like I should embrace
her death and make her look like murder
usually when you make tiny stuff you
make it for like your cat right yes I
could make it for my cat my cat like if
I make a tiny me Mike I will eat it oh
you have a tiny cat no he's a little dog
that's a cat
oh it's 2017 it can be both so I guess
I'm just gonna take this q-tip and like
dip it into the acetone and then just
like go straight in oh my god I feel
like God this is nuts
this is coming off really quick oh my
God look at her we need a new word cuz
she's past shook I kind of just want to
dip my whole head and my actual head
like just start oh can I just repeat my
own face please I hope that I'm able to
like recreate like a good makeup look
because we just completely just ruined
them I mean do we have the Kim K contour
kit I love the Kim Kardashian's a
youtuber now that's fun
I know I can't wait for it a hotknife
her sisters okay I want to get my
doggies head in this the dog the cat dog
Oh
oh my god that's my dream a dog with no
eyes so they can't see anything then I
wouldn't have to close a door when I'm
changing you close the door when you're
changing in front of your dog oh I put
him in downstairs okay so now that we've
completely gotten rid of their makeup I
think we tackle the hair next um so
we're gonna chop it all off this is like
an America's Next Top Model moments like
I don't wanna cut my you will go home
Wow why does she look like Kate Gosselin
from Jon and Kate Plus 8 my looks like
Jon on tumblr they call it the I want to
see the manager haircut so are you truly
convinced that Avril Lavigne is dead oh
no no I love conspiracy theories but I
bros my queen and she'll never die oh
wow this is kind of like a cool
hairstyle right now yeah yours is just
looking more and more like me yeah what
I wish I look like what it'll look like
when your order of roses when it gets
here I wonder at what point did these
turn into like voodoo dolls for
ourselves do I have to like add in
elements of my own person I do I have to
like put in my own blood Oh
so we're actually not done cutting their
hair we're going to actually take a
razor and shave their heads completely
I'm very excited all right let's see
what we can do here oh I'm using the
method I used for my face you just scrub
I can't get past a certain threshold of
shave I just turned mine into a
toothbrush oh I just got my fingers Oh
No I'm suing are you okay
Oh what's good oh wow oh that's a lot
all right so we're back
Shane is band-aided up so it's like
soaking through like this like the tenth
band eh it's okay
I don't know I might die so I'm actually
gonna use the Monster High girls dress
to soak it up
well no it's truly an SVU thing oh my
god wait I know now I'm putting my blood
on it oh my god we called it remember
flashback do I have to like put in my
own blood okay I'm just gonna keep
shaving my doll and then we'll see at
which point in this video I mysteriously
get an injury and turn this into a
voodoo doll of myself I don't know if I
could shave anymore I think she is I
think she's good that's a literally my
current mood so next basically what we
do is we'll give a little bath so give
them a nice relaxing soak soak their
heads in some hot water and that'll help
the that roots of the hair come out it
looks like a cocktail made by a serial
killer I'm gonna put our dog in their
company they look like weird like
pickled people what I mean pickled
people yeah that's a webseries it's been
in there for a while all right I'm gonna
take her out but what's supposed to
happen basically is that the glue inside
their heads have weakened so we can take
out the hair they sound like a cult
leader all right you will like this okay
so we're gonna pop the heads off
I want to dismember got it Oh oh my god
is that what it looks like when you take
a head off cuz I don't want to do it
anymore
you know um in Toy Story with SIDS toys
he's got kind of like a praying mantis
head on like sexy Barbie legs that's who
it is
we're Sid now I've always been safe okay
so basically what you do is you take the
pliers into her neck and you like rip
out the hair follicles this is like when
I dig in my bellybutton this is a little
dr. pimple popper ooh look at that chunk
yeah that's the good stuff all right I'm
gonna be more Savage oh my god I see the
mother lode I see the giant clump this
was actually so tedious and now suddenly
it's so orgasmic Oh
oh wow that's the money shot here's your
cheque miss you're out okay so we're
gonna spray them with like a fixing
spray oh that's nice oh that's much good
I'm pretty sure this is how an anti
huffing PSA begins all right I feel like
we're ready to go upstairs we've puffed
enough of it the next step is we're
gonna like paint their faces back on so
we can do pretty much whatever we want
we have a lot of different things going
on
watercolor pencils pastel pencils and
soft pastels but we have to draw high
balls well you don't have to you can
draw whatever you want are you gonna
draw our eyes closed or dead just giant
X's oh wow that's straight-up voodoo I'm
blending in the contour and then I'm
gonna get a highlight I actually do have
this giant bag of mica powder it's just
like glitter so I'm gonna do what they
say in the makeup videos and I'm gonna
give her a little bit on her nose and
Cupid's bow and her forehead full face
of highlighters challenge what see
somehow she's still wet I don't know
what I'm doing I've never had that broth
I'm gonna hold mine up to the air
conditioning and try and dry her off oh
it's kind of working
oh they're uneven oh no my eyeliner
wings are uneven kinda want to put the
Illuminati sign on her head just so like
she'll be the girl in school who's like
my dad's in the Illuminati yes
you know that girl in school okay so
mine was kind of behind cuz she wouldn't
dry after the fixative spray but I'm
making some moves and kind of trying to
catch up to Shane who's like really all
the way to Orange eyebrows
well wavy browser so two weeks ago my
girl looks like a killer from the purge
what does that mean oh my god
isn't she like an actual demon I'm gonna
put some highlight on we don't need to
contour this is an on tour besides that
I'm just leaving her pretty simple same
I contoured her which not feel bad about
because she was perfect before okay so
finally I think we're ready for hair and
clothes I think we're almost actually
done so these are the wigs that we got
oh my god
oh wow I love mine I think mine is like
a goddess the only thing that weirds me
out about these is how soft they are
like feel
like a dog this yeah feels like a cat is
it cat it's not I don't think it's human
yeah your is this like obviously a wig
there we go maybe that's a little bit
better
mine is natural about alright so I'm
just gonna put Gorilla Glue on this wig
and then just put it on I think you're
an idiot savant at this I really haven't
you just go straight in for it you don't
think and it just turns out wonderfully
you just dipped right in basically all
right let's get the clothes I think
ready oh my god is this Christmas so
this is a combination of clothes from
Barbie that we've stolen and Etsy this
one I thought you might oh honey Oh take
that off
so I wanted to do something like super
extra so I want to cut the knees out of
these jeans and put clear plastic
windows the clear knee mom geez I'm
going blades killer rollerblades are fun
because she's like skating into hell I'm
just cutting like little pieces of these
plastic just to cover the knees there's
so much glue on these pants look let's
put her in there we go there she goes
see she's got Windows the clear plastics
on happening I like my words pop now
she's got a lil whale tail this isn't
much harder than I thought it would be
her eyes her hand so open okay finally
she's got a top on she's kind of got
like a grunge vibe I love that like with
the bra yeah
weirdly too into this mm-hmm
we also have these little gems those
that you glue on as earrings if you felt
like it and also all this little bag of
stuff yeah the Queen crown is a yes that
fits perfectly because she's like the
queen of the underground I think this is
it I think this is my look I don't know
if it's a look with the W I think it
might just be two O's but I don't think
I could have ever competed with what's
the name of yours
Killer Queen okay I mean I think we're
finally done giving these dolls tiny
makeovers in my head originally it was
gonna be like oh like me you know like
with clear new mom jeans and like
straight brown hair but I kind of turned
into like a corpse bride Selena Gomez
Cady heron Fusion Killer Queen
definitely started from the bottom now
she's and health so I'm with the queen
crown because she's queen with the fire
coat because she's lit and I'm with
Starbucks because like it's like a joke
cuz you know she's in a cult Starbucks
as a cult I think everything started to
change for your doll when you bled into
her how's your finger doing by the way
oh wow oh wow that look like a puzzle
piece was missing oh yeah okay I mean so
I feel like now we spent all this time
like doing these makeovers I feel like
we gotta have like a little bit of like
a glam photo shoot time Oh are these
seat belts yeah those are seat belts she
doesn't need those oh I get to drive Wow
she likes me driving around you're an
uber driver oh my god can we get the
rights to literally my life wait look it
from behind the hair streaming
absolutely yeah yes let's test the seat
belts oh my god we should be
instrumented lighting right now see also

that annoying girl who's like no I'm
like really we really flexible like
crazy well thanks so much for coming and
spending hours repainting dolls with me
and also for gouging out part of your
finger I would have done all that just
on my own I think this was just harder
than I thought it would be I feel like I

normal sized things don't get me started
