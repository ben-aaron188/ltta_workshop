hello friends and welcome to another
video today i'm here with christine from
simply the illogical hello friends and
we are going to be doing something that
i wanted to do for a long time but i
could not do without christine so if you
don't know christine or her channel
she's pretty much the queen of hollow
and if you don't know hollow
it's short for holographics but not the
projection i'm talking beautiful
shifting rainbow pigments and if these
shiny rainbows make you feel kind of
gooey inside you may be what christine
calls a hollow sexual I think I'm a
little bit Hollow sexual myself and
holographic things are everywhere right
now from Christine's nails to runways to
clothes on celebrities bodies and
because I'm absolutely terrible at
painting my nails today we're going to
be wearing head-to-toe hollow for a day
one might even call it a hollow
transformation or a hollow day so I went
out and got two bodies worth of
holographic accessories and clothing and
here it is sir I hope I did it right I
don't know what is this is this a hollow
space suit oh my god it is tablecloth Oh
sister oh my god I want to wear it I
need to put it on get it on my body
ah and Mahalo Mountain how do you feel I
feel really good right now you feel a
little around this is to me one enjoy so
I think we should get dressed and see
what we've got
and then we'll venture out and see what
the people of La think of our
head-to-toe hollow look alright need to
do it let's go Finn hey guys ready I
feel like when I watch your videos I am
a homosexual like I'm like oh yeah but I
don't wear a lot of it we're gonna paint
you at oh how do you think people are
going to react they're going to want to
be my friends in videos
those pants are amazing my attention yes
we already getting how sexual I would
kind of like that up a little baby I got
a little bowtie bucket hat and the
little dress and ready for school I was
thinking maybe people think were street
performers we might turn a lot of people
on okay so before we head out into the
world I do have a little bit of a
finishing touch you mean how long makeup
yeah just put it on the face plate it L
Haas hey I'm getting way more than I
mean is making a rain
oh you mean business I call this take
your hollow to work day I wonder if we
should treat today as just like a to
woman arousal caravan spreading more of
the message kind of thing you said bad
little bit extra
oh my teeth now that feels like receipt
what do we get like a hollow band just
kidnap people so if you doing you should
put the finger way is this head to toe
hollow remember so get down there girl
oh oh yeah that's better than Jergens
Barbie glow what is there sleeping why
do you think I think we did good it's
very hot outside do you think this
howling reflects the Sun or does it
absorb it it reflects the Sun but I
think usually the material underneath is
quite thick so we might wet the F will
die happy on my deathbed that's exactly
what I want to be wearing so I'm good
you wink on Mike Craig you ain't you
ain't on my flag you ain't on my clinic
on my flash flag you can call Mike Craig
you went Ewing on my flag you went on my
plague so our first destination bringing
holo to the world was Starbucks so
Christine when did you first discover
your love Oh hallo
yeah that's a tough question what is I
always do you always knew I always knew
no I didn't know what it was called I
didn't know why
using the film I'm surprised our outfits
were mostly ignored at Starbucks so we
wanted to get other people's opinions on
our holo fashion we're in the shade
though so we're not getting the post
that these people are like
I think you need more and then we got to
asking some questions
Sadie what do you think of our Elvis
right now
sparkly I think they're my eyes I'm
going I can see that it's like a mile
away it was winning it all oh yeah when
you see the rainbow
what does it make you feel
joyful yeah where exactly would you
describe yourself
maybe look a little bit lariat yes once
you touch her legs so everything changed
Oh
are they
I think for the most part people have
been liking it or seeming like happier
excited you know hi yeah it seems like
most kind of smile I think we're you
know ransoms
some-something's they're interested now
one development was that some people
actually thought that we were street
performers there was a guy who was like
I worked for like the tourism department
of Santa Monica it seemed like it looked
like he thought that we were actually
three performers and we needed a permit
and then after we explained that we were
not actually street performers and he
switched to are you tourists and do you
need a mask either people think there
were street performers or that we are
just very law that we're coming out of
their country a whole other type of
fashion gonna who you are from another
country complain yeah so we gave it a
shot we tried the whole chrome tinman
statue thing and just stood still for a
while so you're gonna stand there but it
didn't really work out for us so after
getting some modern on the street
opinions about our outfits I was curious
to know a little bit more about the
history of holographics fashion when do
you perceive hollow you remember
probably like six years old and it was
in my mother's wardrobe flashy
scrunching making that awakened
something inside
oh you does not in fact from what I can
tell I don't think Hollow has ever been
as mainstream as it is now but rainbow
holographics have been worn for a very
long time in jewelry and holographic
clothes date back to the 1960s as
interest in futuristic clothing prompted
designers to try using non cloth
materials such as holographic discs
clear plastic and metals four concepts
clothing so what do you think of our
outfit awesome lettuce I'm going to
shine right not to mention it was also
the late sixties where summer of love
psychedelic and rainbow imagery were
everywhere
plastic clothes and rainbows it feels
like a match made in heaven how does the
hollow me
I'm stoned but a lot since the 60s holo
has kind of stuck around it was a part
of the disco pitch scene in the 70s
we're wearing the loudest outfit was at
a premium and in fact the more you
looked like the disco ball the better
you almost look like a fishing lure the
holo aesthetics popped up again in the
80s parallel to the invention of the
cd-rom once again taking up its role
from the late 60s as a symbol of the
future and of Technology this
connotation carried through into the 90s
with clothes accessories makeup and lots
of body glitter as the turn of the
millennium peach new interest into the
future one of the most iconic 90s hollow
moments for me was Zenon girl of the
21st century's earring where it was like
the secret to all the ships codes and it
was a little seedy well the CB emoji is
the hollow sexual image you think CDs
are updated wrong they're more relevant
than ever not right listening but just
for your visual consumption and pleasure
so I guess that's all to say that hollow
fashion has roots in blings futurism and
psychedelics we were walking around a
lot today yes
oh it's exhausting being a human piece
of Hollow but I think overall I think we
are brightening up people with rainbows
I think we made their day a little
brighter and they smiled and I had a
funny story to tell at dinner where
they're like I thought crazy people
today okay so now we're going to go get
some dinner we worked up a hollow
appetite we don't need dessert
we are dessert or we get cheesecake yeah
so we went to the Cheesecake Factory
Athan cheesecake and then had some fun
times in the bathroom once the Sun sets
the hollow does lose a bit of luster but
if you turn on your high beams you can
get the party back again good it works
well I think overall we were pretty
well-received today like ice makes most
people smile I think actually people
liked it better when we weren't talking
to them like I feel like we have that's
not people tell me normally like to stop
talking they did a little bit like we're
Elvis impersonators well it's like
they're not sure what kind of
impersonators we are yeah we're like
they're doing something and doing some
places
I just wanted my my outsides match my
inside because I'm hollow inside it was
like you're can see in times when you do
that's all I know no but I feel like you
know whether or not like LA and Santa
Monica we're ready for us to bring them
this hollow we brought that out yeah we
did we brought it all can I take this oh
I know you got it yes of course it has I
sweat like all over that's the number
one reason why you should keep it my
neck is 22 you next 20 my body is
quenched
I feel like a lot of the hollow clothing
is like pretty plastic thank you for
