hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm going to be trying out
the 3 second eyebrow stamp as seen on
internet I've been seeing it on my
facebook feed my Instagram feed you guys
have been tweeting it at me
so I thought might as well grab it test
it out and see how arrived cleans away
what it is is that they brow stamps that
you get I think in eyebrow powder and
then smack on your face now currently I
use like an eyebrow pencil to do my
eyebrows I don't really delve into
powder all too much I say I'm actually
decently new to like doing my eyebrows
with makeup
so it does take a decent amount of time
and I'm also very bad at doing them on
the go I have a hard enough time just
doing them when I'm completely
stationary like sitting in front of a
mirror but then in the car when you've
got your makeup in your lap and you're
just trying to get it even eyebrows can
be difficult so this thing looks any
good when I put it on it might be a
really good solution for doing your
eyebrows in the car because you just
wham bam thank you ma'am
in a moving vehicle ok so let's get into
it let me open this up really quick
ah we're in oh oh oh so many papers so
we've got a couple of different shapes
we've got a structured arch and a soft
arch stamp and then we've got our brow
powder contact with mirror elbow tie
right here let me open this up that
looks like my brow powder here I got I
think like the dark color let me see if
it says what I got yeah I got the dark
seems about right
how to use your three second brow
eyebrow stamp one align the stamps with
your eyebrows to determine which brow
shades most closely resemble of your own
I'm going to go for the structured arch
I think that seems like it probably
matches me the best practice stamping on
your eyebrow don't stamp directly onto a
try rolling it across your eyebrow to in
a small circular motion gently rub the
stamp into the powder until the sponge
is sufficiently coated with brow powder
that doesn't seem right
that could be right there we go that
seems right yes three align the stamp
with your eyebrow and press firmly with
even pressure for three seconds the
harder you press the darker your eyebrow
will be pull the sample way to reveal
your eyebrows
I think you hit a little bit of skin
right here soft use the included spoolie
brush to get ready for any excess powder
around your eyebrows you can also brush
your eyebrows to help blend in the color
I think it looks a little bushy but my
eyebrows can look bushy just naturally
it definitely filled up this part I
don't think I got any of the arch going
though
alright I'm gonna try this one again I
think this time I'm going to be a little
more forceful with the tail end of the
brow all right
back at it again ready and then press it
in pressing hard on the other side and
whoa do I just not know where my
eyebrows are I think this is probably as
with most like hack products something
you need to get the hang of honestly I'm
having a hard time seeing where the
eyebrow piece should go because of this
like plastic barrier I just I want I
can't all right we're gonna have to try
this one more time because this is
unexpected
take three on this side ready we're
going to do this this on my brows if I
go like this it's still a little high
well I second yeah I'm a little high on
the left side oh no little low
it was both high and low somehow I'm
nervous to see what happened
hi ready yeah lift off okay I think that
there's probably a dull my eyebrow it
doesn't look very weak it's a problem
near your brother's eyebrows right now
the Groucho
they're very Groucho Marx right now they
definitely look a little bit
overpowering like this is a very much a
Disney villain eyebrow I'm scheming I've
got plans afoot okay I'm gonna try this
side now and hopefully hopefully it
turns out well I got my stamp you got to
tell me if it looks like I'm gonna do it
right so that's perfect that's it right
there yeah yeah go my eyelashes got
second that one somehow see that wasn't
bad I think that was better than the
others I'm I'm the best one yet I think
they're obviously both a bit dark but
you could definitely just that by
brushing through with a spoolie or not
pressing as hard I was just pressing
hard because I was nervous I'm just
brushing them through just to make them
look a little bit more even and also
just a little more natural I do like
this brush they give you I think I'm
going to touch these up with some
concealer in a second just because
there's just a lot of stray powder
flying around the face I'm looking at
myself in the viewfinder and I do look
very much like a silent film actor like
the eyebrows are very dark to portray
emotion I wouldn't say that just from my
first attempt but these are super ideal
and a lot easier than just doing my
normal eyebrow routine but I am
committed to seeing if these things are
good to be used on the go so I'm going
to take this we're going to get in the
car and then maybe on the train and
we'll see if this stance actually makes
it easier to do your eyebrows on the go
and maybe I'll get better at doing them
because right now I'm not rocking it
alright we're in the car right now
looking at it more after it kind of sat
on my face for a while I'm less upset
about it so now that I feel like I'm
finally like happy with how they look
we're going to see if we can we can
really nail them on the go so I am going
to take them off and try and do it in
the car we are going around like rush
hour time there should be some good
traffic it's going to be a little bit
bumpy it's going to be a little stop and
go okay so I've got my makeup wipe I'm
going to take them off my browser are
ready to go and I've got my three
seconds brow right here I'm just going
to put you guys right here for a second
sorry this is a very strange angle
the couple without work
that kind of work so I'm going to powder
it up but I remember all my lessons
earlier today I'm just going to go
tribal a little bit slower than I think
I put it on there was a bubble right
after did I do it okay I don't know okay
wolf look at me straight on I just look
so surprised right now I'll try that
again take you on the right brow there's
real spots well
alright this is what we're doing we're
doing between the legs all leading to
the lips are here we go nope the back
bar doesn't feel right it's kind of try
to mitigate it down but I think I just
kind of like windshield wipers like
pigment pollen it's going to be good no
that was horrible it's hard because when
I line it up at the front the back part
just doesn't want to go too so really
right brow is my problem brows so I'm
going to go for left brow really quick
only that where it is a momentary stop
in the car here little lower I think
that was it Oh - oh definitely too low I
too low IL advised you how could it be
too long
I died you went too low no oh why is it
so hard for me to figure out where this
brow stamp should go you got bad
hand-eye coordination is that really
what it is
should I try it okay Tyler's going to
try his hand at this thing and then
we're going to get on the train and
maybe of Tyler's holding the camera
won't be such of an issue for me we're
stopped close and I think that if I'm
going to say that it entails in a
hand-eye coordination that I need to put
that to the test
I just dropped this on the ground
hand-eye coordination huh I'm about to
show you up stuff to be fair you were
also try to film so I am stopped this is
my sole focus ready ma look at there
look good I can't tell it looks better
than what I did so easy to lie up here
yeah you assume that you're good and
then like you kind of miss the arch
alright do the other one just for just
for fun well that was my first one to be
fair so I don't think we can judge my
ability to do these quite yet oh I think
I got this one's off really yeah I can
feel like just it's pushing the hairs a
little bit ready and it looks pretty
good Hey look at me
yeah and that was really nice yeah show
me the side Oh No look at the side all
really look at the side oh I missed ah
shoot she's like good good good good
bad I do feel showed up by the stamp a
little bit I am caught eating my words
you kind of look like Hoffa Elvis yeah
with these brows okay so we're waiting
for the Train
I play theses three second gracias it
works on a different kind of commute
we're going to try now and I think it
will be better because Tyler will be
holding the camera in high school I used
to take the train every single day to
school and I used to be so good at doing
my makeup on the train but also in high
school
I never did anything to my brow but you
see later on the trains of quarter
prophet saw them on the trains so
sometimes I employed to prostrate brow
powder you can get you
bring second I know
that stoplight all this time
there you go yeah
oh you went low oh hello little oh yeah
I feel it
it's not that bad I was over right here
what do I sound like that
I mean it's better than anything in the
car it was actually better than what
you'd in the apartment that's it all
right
left round we do not know when the stops
are coming so we're kind of no idea
bouncing and going
hi I think you actually nailed that one
hey okay let's be ready
give it a good job
oh right here he's so hard to help
that's the renewable powder is easily
it looks ok could be worse
balance diction
okay so we're on the way back I think
it's a lottery ticket it
they're all perfect by now so I think
the dancing was pretty well as low the
campus on what keeps against that we
still can get a devious stamp on there
so I don't think that my route will ever
perfectly prison sizes and your faith
will always be a little bit off
especially if it definitely would have
liked
touching out like some brushing through
just a little
but but I feel like I got it pretty much
as good as a bra
I know that sir Robert
my rocket I think that for me the
three-second brow didn't necessarily
take three seconds even when I felt like
I had a good stamp I definitely felt
like I still had to sort of like blend
and spread the powder around just and I
think the stamp is smaller than my
eyebrow my issue when I'm filling in my
eyebrows is just kind of like sparseness
and like extra hairs and I just want to
like unify it and I still had to sort of
like go outside the lines of the stamp
to like get those hairs in the family
just like bring them into the group
photo I think that this is maybe a
product that could work really well for
people who have shorter eyebrow hairs
and smaller eyebrows I do think that
after a few tries I did start getting
better at using the stamps and I do
think that the powder actually stays on
your face decently well but I think it
is generally a little bit difficult to
line them up correctly with your
eyebrows even when practicing because
like it's hard you can't see around the
plastic like where exactly the stamp is
going
I wish there just was no extra plastic
to be honest I just wish it was just a
stamp so I just had a better feeling of
where exactly it was going thank you so
