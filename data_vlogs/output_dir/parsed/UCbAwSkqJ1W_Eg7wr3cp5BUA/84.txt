hello friends and welcome to another
video today I'm going to be testing out
magnetic fake eyelashes I first saw
these in a video on my Facebook feed a
couple of weeks ago maybe more like a
month ish ago I knew instantly that I
needed to try these I am someone who has
a lot of issues putting on fake lashes
sometimes the glue like ends up in
little mountains so like the lash isn't
laying straight across
sometimes I glue my eyes shut I glued my
eye shut before so the idea of magnetic
fake lashes with no glue seems like an
amazing deal to me so I'm going to try
these out right now see if I can't get
the hang of them and then I'm going to
try them tomorrow in my routine and see
if I can't get these things on faster
than I can get fake lashes on this glue
because I am extremely slow with glue
let's take a gander at these shall we
they're from a company called 1/2 lash
these are kind of expensive they were
$69 for the one case with two pairs in
them but they are reusable so they're
not like the one or a couple time use
like other fake lashes are okay let's
open this box and see what's inside
mm okay so inside I've got what vaguely
resembles like a Chanel makeup case a
cleaning cloth or a just a fun
handkerchief I don't know and then
inside kind of looking like the insect
display at a museum the lashes here we
go
product description the lashes include
magnetic materials which may damage
magnetic storage media including on bank
and credit cards computer hard drives TV
screens or monitors damn these things
can take down a TV screen if you
experience any redness pain or
inflammation while or after wearing
lashes seek medical attention
immediately
so these seem like a little more
dangerous than I thought directions
freeze one whole top one to lash the one
without the red dot over your eye to
position lash on top of your natural
lashes so the outside edge lines up with
the edge of your natural lash line wait
do I just have to hold it there three
leave the top lash where it is and then
just let it chill there for a second and
pick up the bottom lash
one with the red dot for without
blinking placed the bottom lash under
your natural lashes so it meets and
connects with the top lash magnet well
that can't be right I think I actually
put it like way too far out on my eye so
they are magnetized but they're not in
my lash line they're like halfway across
my lashes all right let's try this again
take your index finger and thumb and
gently slide the two magnets away from
each other oh that wasn't so bad
all right guys I'm gonna put this top
lash where it should be open the eye and
go in Elle why does this look wrong like
I look like a muppet I gotta try this a
third time because this is this is just
not working out for me mom spaghetti
sauce oh maybe it's supposed to look
like that what if I just try and move it
closer in I will say they're very easy
to take off take five right here right
now going down at the bottom
I'll just so fly no damn it it's
supposed to look like that honestly I
will stay here no matter how long it
takes until these things work I'm going
to try my right eye and then just come
back to this one is that right no same
issue yeah they're not on the lid am I
the problem here all right so I'm using
a tweezer I'm going to double fist it
with two tweezers it's already use
operation right now to the protein why I
with two pairs of tweezers this is fine
look I think that and I drop it alright
I placed that one down like that going
in with the tweezers like this Oh with
the tweezer no I think it was the Y - we
think they look down at then they are
not flush okay ty you take the hot seat
I'm gonna try and put these on you okay
do it
all right here's your left I like this
alright right eye oh they're the guys in
Clockwork Orange
alright look up oh did I clip your eye
eyelid a little bit right NEP okay I
think that's our best one yet by a lot
I know them looks pretty good actually
alright ty thank you for being my guinea
pig it was actually quite helpful to see
it from the bird's eye view I if I had
to say well my problem is that I'm
having a hard time not blinking damn it
oh no it's gone it's gone serious yeah
it's gone okay I found it
it's all in the mirror I'm just trying
to avoid blinking at all cost
David I just blinked dammit all right
I'm going to go back to the left I I
just I cannot I am undone hey wait wait
did I do it
is this is that right I don't know what
this is right but it feels like the
closest I've been so far on the left eye
the funny thing is they don't look any
different oh I do look kind of different
can you tell it's not perfectly flush
but it's better so after trying about
twelve times on each eye that's a modest
estimate I finally got the one two
Cosmetics lashes to work decently well
that was pretty darn difficult I'm going
to be honest if you're someone who's
really good at doing fake lashes you're
probably going to be good at this thing
if you're someone who's good at doing
your contacts you might be good at doing
this thing so maybe I was just set up to
struggle but I think I got to some point
of goodness so now that I've gotten it
like semi successfully on both eyes can
I do it faster tomorrow and like picking
up the skill or is it just a crapshoot
every time so I'm going to try and do
this again tomorrow and see if I can
wear it all day and we'll see how these
lashes fare all right so it's the next
day and I'm going to try and I use my
fake lashes today in my makeup routine I
did find this card that they sent in the
package that I clearly didn't see it
says dear lash lover please take a
moment to check out the instructions on
the back of this card before you try on
your lashes WAMP they do have some
pictures but it was pretty much exactly
what I was doing I think that you just
need some practice so I'm going to do my
makeup and then when I'm ready for
lashes I'll check back in see what
happens alright so my makeup is done and
I'm ready for the fake lashes
there's my little bed of insects so I'm
going to do my right eye first oh that's
that that's not right
nope too far out yeah they look you can
see how far out that was try that again
that clamps at all what the belt work
hey those are pretty close in what just
happened it almost feels like the magnet
is holding a little bit of my eyelid
like I feel like it's holding my eyes
open a little bit and I feel like that's
that's why I know it's at least close to
being right going in for the left eye
next moon
looks wrong I'm kind of standing with my
legs wide apart just to get myself a
good good sturdy base I don't think
they're even know that's wrong I can
feel it that's not right
oh crap all right checking in I've been
filming for 14 minutes and 28 29 seconds
oh my god I just pulled out a real lash
can you see that does that work I think
I might've gotten it
it's taken me 17 minutes and 22 seconds
they're not perfectly even I think that
they're pretty good I think that I'm
improving in that I don't think I could
be worse than yesterday
Tyler has informed me he thinks the left
one looks a little wonky so I will try
and fix it not in the car because if I
lived in the car god help me but at some
point later because I just want to leave
it on for a little while just in case I
can't get it good again remember Sofia
keep it away from your camera it might
be a high-powered magnet that would
destroy it it's been about an hour and I
have two hours and I might be crazy but
I like this lashes moving maybe it's not
I don't mean like like moving actively
but it feels it might be my other goal
all right it's like my breathing slowly
down this is the one we'll have to fix
so I'm going to go into a bathroom and
try to fix that soon all right sorry
this is a weird angle you guys can make
it a lot of double chin but I'm trying
to show you guys this angle and bit
lashes so you somewhere where you can
see nope hello guys this is this is hard
you on the go
alright can I do it it actually took me
like about five minutes
maybe I'm getting quicker maybe it got
some water I'm actually not sure if I
matched them or if I just made this one
work because I feel like I close my eye
really hard and it felt like that one
was a little bit but I do think it looks
more even so regardless I'm just going
to go with it we are going to go to like
a Staples and see if we can find a
magnet and see if we can lift these
things off of my eyes of the magnet
which is probably not something you
should do so I'll try and like wear them
all bit longer before you do that but we
are going to staple or some office story
so we're like our four and a half five
how do my lashes look first of all they
were pretty good they're not separating
like one is not falling off from the
other it's more like I feel like they
might migrate down the lash I didn't you
know I didn't touch it so you can do
anything but we're here looking for
Magnus to see what we can do with these
lashes if they'll just like fly towards
the mountain cool so I'm thinking that
these magnets might work I think we were
like appropriately mixing science into
this right now oh yeah so I had the
lashes on for about eight hours I think
it's time to take them off right here so
we've got two magnets I'm nervous this
is a bad idea no it's going to be fun
right well we'll find out Oh in there
working is anything happening oh my god
I think they're huh oh yeah if it is it
suck oh ha ha did it rip my eyelashes
off I don't know I do a question I guess
we didn't think about that I mean every
line you wanna do next one
yeah Krusty is amazed by them like to
eat though he wasn't dead think so then
Tyler thought that looks so fun he wants
a chance try going from under Oh should
I get both yeah I got both mmm yep all
right
so thoughts on my magnetic lashes I
really like that you don't have to mess
around with glue I like how comfortable
they are and I like how easy they are to
take off they are quite expensive but
they are reusable so you kind of have
that like if you can make it work for
you over a long amount of time they
could be worth it my biggest concern is
just getting it even like I could get
one I nicely and then the other I was
just kind of like looking like a wonky
like the whole time and I don't exactly
know what tricks I can do to help myself
get them even on both eyes I think that
normal glue on fake lashes do last
better throughout the day but these are
so much more comfortable you kind of
gotta like weigh your options and if
you're only going out for a few hours
it'll probably be fine thank you guys so
