hello friends and welcome to another
video this week I'm going to be trying
out another questionable clothing item
and this time it's a shirt I didn't
really intend this to be a series I
started off with the Teva ugh hybrid
which some people thought were the
ugliest shoes in the world and then the
clear nilaam jeans
took the internet by storm and I tried
those out as well and then this shirt
appeared shout out to giuliana from
Facebook for showing this to me first
this shirt is from ASOS it's 38 dollars
and it is a fictional band t-shirt
covered with a giant ruffle sash if that
sounds confusing to you you're not alone
this band t-shirt might be the worst one
ever made a Sosa's band ruffle t-shirt
is breaking the internet festival
fashion as weirdest deeply confused
t-shirt combines shoulder tutu with
possibly non-existent metal bands unless
you guys know the bands named HNT jlv so
there was one headline that was like
this is the worst teacher ever made but
mostly people are just confused so I
think we should try and make some sense
of this thing I'll bring a shirt out
here it is the ASOS band ruffle t-shirt
one of the reasons that people are
confused by it is because I don't know
what the name of the band is then it has
a skeleton hand reaching out from what I
can only assume with the tuft of grass
holding a blue flower and the tagline is
love from beyond the grave and then we
have the the ruffle that everyone's
talking about the purple ruffle right
across there so I'm going to wear this
shirt all week and see if I can't try
and understand this shirt a little bit
more just what it wants from us you know
what do you want alright let's put this
thing on whoo do you just roll around in
some tutus
I feel like Miss America kind of I walk
so they gave me this too - it's a little
bit is it Carmen Miranda your name
you've got a little bit of like
that's um my head kind of thing the vibe
I kind of get is it's like you are
playing little kid dress-up I definitely
in my day especially like late middle
school early high school had graphic
t-shirts that were like for something
that didn't exist the question is just
like together the cohesion where is it I
would actually love to know how many of
these a thoughts have sold one pie
cheese I am feeling playful feeling
fluffy and really excited to see what
the me feels right maybe it could double
with the cat toys he just hates this
okay so it is day one of wearing the
most confusing shirt the day one I
wanted to wear it in a simple way kind
of get a feel for it my instinct with
this shirt is to cinch it at the waist
or like tuck it into something just
because it's quite voluminous but the
way they silent on the ASOS website is
just as like a shirt with pants so I've
got a t-shirt on and pants on the shirt
is definitely more front-and-center than
the pants or the shoes were just gets
harder to ignore it and closer to my
face is closer to your line of sight I'm
not particularly embarrassed and
nobody's really said anything I'm just
getting used to wearing a little tutu on
myself this is how it feels like I feel
like I'm just wearing a little extra
something like a normal outfit with a
little extra sauce so the next night
Tyler and I went out for a little like
date night and she's all night I was
hoping like what is this trying to pay
what is the theme of this shirt
and to me it's like excess it's like a
cherry on top
I try to echo that in the shoes are kind
of like speaker boots with studded
tongues and like little jingle jangles
it's like the rattle on a rattlesnake I
was like I'm warning you that
something's coming
we have this very loud figuratively and
literally I think the last employment
you don't want to temper and you want to
really clean it you have to embrace you
gotta lean in it's not necessarily an a
ring shirt it's not like a come-hither
date-night type shirt but it did feel
better to be wearing it kind of in like
a nighttime dinnertime setting where I
was like oh a reason to wear something a
little more exciting
you chose topics because love like you
know not the least syllable food on the
planet the purple frill is definitely
something that you need to be careful of
when eating thankfully I got out of
dinner with my tutu unscathed but I was
definitely paying attention to where it
was going
didn't you could like remove and wash
yeah you just saw the lot don't bend
they just not hold a baton to your face
right there day three I wore a mustard
seder skirt and then high-heeled boot
okay so where's the mall and I am
carrying around a very large bag oh
definit I have to return but I do feel a
little bit like a spectacle just because
I added to height about the flounce I've
got the bag I've got the mustard skirt
there's just a lot going on the shirt is
bringing the heat you know you want to
meet the shirt where it is you don't
want to
your shields are so tall you're going to
get to rap I'm going to wrap the tutu
look at me it's me look at me mustard
colors also a little ravish I don't know
I was curling something I don't know if
it's working that's why we feel cool I'm
trying something I don't know I also
realized that wearing this shirt for a
week is different than wearing shoes or
jeans for a week in that you you should
wash it pretty often you just turn it
inside out put it in cold water with
light colors then reshape and lay flat
to dry so we're just going to watch it
like this terms of leggings in there
just to keep it company you don't think
you put it in there just pray a new
shirt comes out kind of worry for it did
it survive I know I'm nervous Ariela Oh
looks pretty jacked it washes well I
actually do think I think it see it in
fighting form the ruffle is just as
goofy as ever that's for tomorrow eh I'm
stroking it like it is crusty like it's
a cat so on day four I had a meeting at
an office and I wore my shirt under a
blazer it wasn't necessarily the most
business casual look ever but I think
the Blazer helped you know how to cover
all my bases when I first thought of
this idea I was like oh I'm going to
look ridiculous but it actually kind of
works in my opinion I don't know what it
is I don't know if it's that the tool is
mostly disguised by the blazer but
there's something about it that I kind
of like I kind of felt like a rocker
like a rock star you know I felt like I
had my band t-shirt which was a little
distressed in my case a little ruffled
underneath my blazer my skinny jeans in
my combat boots I was like yeah I'm here
hopefully they're not too disturbed I
just kicked me out entirely
okay so update I just got out of the
meeting and I didn't get kicked out but
I did get a hey cool shirt so who knows
what that really means but the words
were hey cool shirt day five I just went
no makeup shirt skirt and trusty
Birkenstock so I'm just working today so
I try to keep it kind of casual just
because I felt like up until that point
I had been trying to dress it up and I
gotta be honest that I don't really
think that my outfit is working today
I think I look okay but I don't think
that it's really doing me any favors
this is my sort of wanna make a cup of
tea right now
I can't figure out any hot water it
seems like such a like statement shirt
but it's like oh you were just trying to
be kind of like casual and natural today
why that shirt so I don't think that
this can function like a normal t-shirt
I think you do have to try and style
this thing I'm doing a cold water as if
this is what I want
so a day six rolls around and I haven't
gotten a lot of outside opinions besides
one cool shirt so I wanted to get more
input so ethos had presented this shirt
under the she's with the band festival
collection so day six we decided to go
on a little road trip okay guys we are
in the car we are headed to Coachella
because if it's mostly for festivals but
not for everyday we're in a why not go
to a festive throwback to your fav music
icon with vintage banshees grunge
inspired plaid and distressed denim for
days now go out and party like a rock
star you sure look like we actually do
have any plans to go to Coachella in
fact we still don't have tickets but we
are going to go to the outside of
Coachella like hopefully the entrance or
maybe the parking lot and see if anyone
entering the festival would like to wear
this shirt
something like the chalice I'm excited
that this could be my first patrol in
experience I feel like I dressed in
preference
you look well dressed we're here at the
scenic day parking lot at Coachella
honestly I can't wait to see what people
have to say I'm a little giddy all
butterflies in my stomach I just thought
it was like a dead end miniskirt and I
have these like Doc Martin boots that
have flowers on them at first
I wonder if it was maybe just me or if
it was the shirt that was scaring people
off people didn't really want to talk to
me at first but you know after a while I
got a few people who were willing to
give me their honest opinions of the
shirt Jessica's here and she's going to
tell me what she thinks about the shirt
and if it is festival wear or not it
doesn't look like a surely like a tune
to it that works not only I feel like
you drop into doing
our place knowledge I thought I was it
for the most part the consensus was no
at a music festival especially Coachella
from what I can tell people really like
put their best foot forward they want to
be fashionable they like look at this
shirt and they're like that's not what I
would choose they could work on
something there were a couple people who
actually did like it and said that they
might want to wear it just because it
was so unique I dig it yeah we all work
I think the more I look at it the more I
like it but it was skirt now I think
some of the Articles that were
originally confused about this shirt
kind of gave it a pass when they saw
that it was like in the sensible section
that clears things up a little the shirt
would definitely fit in at Coachella or
Burning Man although it may look a
little out of place at school or in the
office I think that just calling it a
festival look is kind of being like oh
what a wacky shirt maybe someone at
Coachella would wear it oh all right so
the final day of the week arrived so I
wore my band ruffle tee shirt with my
clear knee mom jeans and my Tivo ugh
hybrid featuring fishnet under my clear
knee mom jeans because there was an
overwhelming demand for fishnets
here we are the light of day I made it
outside I actually the more I look at
the prom
before I like the shirt as the Chiefs
together weirdly weirdly I like them
though I don't hate the shoes in general
the shoes I don't think worked out in
this in this particular outfit favorite
white sunny today and probably like the
worst temperature for all of these
things to be on my body well the most
uncouple part as always are the plastic
on the knees I just basically like in a
cartoon like when you fall out of a
window default serves that ones like a
laundry hanging outside and you're like
go through each clothing piece that is a
lot like what you're looking like but I
also feel like this is the beginning of
like some kind of dance routine and all
of my clothing is connected like snap
rip it all off in one motion enemy
wearing a really sexy like
you want someone to be like I don't like
your outfit you go yeah I asked our
friends Eric mark and Coke to choose
which item they thought was the worst
what do you think of this outfit
altogether
the shirt and insurance is completely
separated it looks like you just drag it
over your shoulder where does my eye go
the - to wrap around your shoulder looks
like we're mauled by a ballerina so when
you see this outfit your eye go straight
to the shirt as the worst thing yes I
know she I think people just think I'm
having a bad fashion day I don't think
I'm mortally offending anyone it feels
kind of like a costume kind of just
confusing but you know things have been
worse I've had worse days Oh
I missed the ball I was
overall this wasn't the worst week of my
life it's just a weird-looking shirt
after all and I'll say that the shirt
was not uncomfortable to wear even if
it's outwardly weird most of the
articles said that it was deeply
confusing which I agree with I think
that it's a pretty confusing shirt it is
kind of fashion-forward in that way
where it definitely evokes the reaction
it's also kind of youthful and playful I
think it definitely gives off that my
five year old cousin dressed me chic I
think for me the reason I don't want to
keep wearing this shirt is because I
think it just takes over the outfit too
much I think with the other ugliest
items you could kind of make them do
different things and I think with this
you're just you kind of you got one
thing to say the only time when I felt
like I was giving off a different vibe
was when I had that blazer over it it
kind of gave like a little bit of a
business in the back party in the front
five you know rather than just party all
the way around party all night long
all in all I am kind of happy to have
found a shirt to complete the first
iteration of the ugliest outfit in the
world there will be more so-called ugly
things worn on this channel
got a couple already in the mail but I
do think of the items that I've tried
out so far this shirt was just it was a
little more insistent than the other
pieces this shirt just has its own
vision of of life and you just kind of
got to go with it or not wear it thank
