hey guys what's up ado me getting I hope
you are having an amazing day because
I'm having an amazing day so bomb had
been an amazing day you should be having
an amazing day so today I changed it up
I decided to a little rant for you guys
because I like doing different variety
kind of stuff so I decided to tell you
guys there's a little story that
happened yesterday when I was in the
train station so the New York City train
stations if you guys do not know the
craziest things happen in the New York
City train stations if you guys ever
want to see something so weird or see
stupid stuff happen
use the New York City train station
subway is just completely weird ignorant
sometimes it's cool sometimes it's fun
but when I was in the train yesterday
something really really ignorant
happened I decided to share it with you
guys and have a little rant about it
because 2016 is coming and I want the
Year to start you know fresh to start
new to start amazing with love with
positivity so I was in the train minding
my own business on my phone and I
overheard a couple people talking about
the Paris attacks and terrorism
terrorists and stuff like that I
overheard someone saying all that
terrorism has no religion but then
there's someone replying very ignorant
to that person saying that up but if you
had to choose a religion that promotes
terrorism they would choose Islam and
when I heard that I stopped minding my
business and I decided to be a little
nosy because I don't know I feel like
when I hear ignorant people like that I
feel like it's not their fault like they
don't know they don't know they're not I
don't know that they're probably slowed
their parents or somewhere around them
didn't teach them much so I felt like
you know I gotta teach them you know let
me tell that maybe I can help this
ignorant person saying that so this is
what I told him I went up to the condo
and I was like hey I'm sorry for cutting
you off but Islam does not promote
terrorism Islam is peace in Islam we say
as-salam-o-alaikum
to each other as-salaam alaikum means
may peace be upon you peace may peace be
upon you we're not saying may terrorism
be upon you we're not saying may
violence be upon you we're saying may
peace be upon you so if we're saying I
sat on my leg with each other
every literally every single day and
we're given peace upon everyone why
would anyone think we're promoting
terrorism so when I told that to the kid
he replied to me saying sorry and that
he thought assalamu alaikum met what's
up or hello or like hey how are you
doing I told him to not apologize to me
because it's probably not as false
probably the people around him that get
him to think like that but he was
actually really cool about it once I
started talking to everybody he got
really really positive about Islam and
he was like wow I didn't know that
family means may peace be upon you know
so that kid turned out to being really
cool and understanding it's cuz I felt
like it's cuz he never met a Muslim
person or anything like that before
because he told me I was one of the
first Muslims he's ever spoke to and had
a convo with who spoke English so his
mind his view on Islam changed a lot
when I was speaking to him but his
friend ended up being a little ignorant
to me he was like oh it's not Muslims
fault for like all this terrorism going
around it's Islam's for I'm like oh my
god like I always mind what would
business in a trip I'm sorry I promise
how about nosey but when I hear people
say that I feel like and when I'm there
I feel like I need to like just jump in
and like fix the situation or like
cleanse their minds because I already
cleansed one kids and on these are
cleanses care so I'm like I gotta get
back to work and cleanse this kids my
I'm like look Islam it's not Islam's it
can't be Islam for Islam is perfect
Muslims aren't I know if you guys heard
that quote so many times was alright but
look if you think Islam really promotes
violence if you would kill an ant or
step on an ant that's a sin in Islam so
if you're killing an ant or stepping on
an ant
and that's considered a sin why would
Islam promote violence
he was so speechless he didn't know what
say those even people around the trained
clapping for me say I wish I would have
lagged there anything but I didn't want
to like pull out my camera and like show
like oh look this is what I'm saying so
just when I thought I was done with the
group of kids another one of the kids he
was like oh but Isis is Islam and you
guys always be going around doing all
that crazy stuff chopping people's heads
and that's when nosy Adam
comes in it tries to cleanse their mind
once again I want em to the kid I was
like Oh
Isis huh Isis but do you do you know
that Isis also kills Muslims and do you
know the majority of people who are
against Isis are Muslims and do you know
that us Muslims we do not consider Isis
as Muslims because anyone who commits
who commits a murder at anything in
Islam is no longer Muslims the kid
didn't know what to say when I told him
that seriously he was like oh you
actually kind of made a point I don't
know what to say that's exactly his
words I even told him that it's okay and
it's not their fault because it's
probably the community they're around or
I don't know who they're on but I told
them they should you know have some
Muslim friends or learn more into Islam
just so they can get a nice positive
mind into it when I told him that they
actually thanked me for actually telling
them some more positive stuff about his
son even the Pope tweeted out the other
day the Pope he tweeted that Muslims
Christians they should be in every other
religion they should be like brothers
and sisters and that's what I love that
seriously love seeing that from coming
from the Pope I loved loved seeing and
he is right every religion were all
human we're all human this is my
mentality we're all human we should all
be one and if aliens come from Jupiter
to fight us us humans need to unite we
need to unite and fight the aliens one
of the aliens come and take over Earth
us humans we can't be arguing about oh
my god Muslims are terrorists oh my god
um Hispanics for this oh my god this for
that oh my god that's we can't we need
to be together as human beings and we
need to go fight them aliens but
seriously all jokes aside there's over a
billion Muslims and if you guys really
think Islam or Muslims or terrorists
then this world wouldn't even be here if
Muslims are terrorists I really like
that I just want to give a huge shout
out to every other religion out there

nearest hating meeting who are your
