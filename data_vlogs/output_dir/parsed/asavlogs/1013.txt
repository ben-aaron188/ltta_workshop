and everything like that I had an
amazing amazing like I was done by
Prince animal and everything after Queen
cenomar I left around 9:00 9:30 I went
out of quinces anymore and then I seen
this guy I'm looking at this guy McGill
he looks he looks so familiar and then
this guy was trying to run away and then
when I remembered like I remember his
face cuz around that area in the train
station
that's where I got basically jumped by
these by these five dudes remember last
year when I got a black guy he was one
of them he was one of the guys that that
punch that sucker punched me I don't
know where he was one of them so I was
saying I'm like this could do it like so
familiar and then when I was I was going
up I seen him avoiding me trying to run
away so I followed him quick then he was
amazing like trying to hide between
people so I kept walking faster then he
started running
so I ran ran like an idiot that I am I
ran I got to toughen it up and slim and
use of then thinking like what is what
Rayner and I caught think I caught the
guy I caught him I put him literally
like and this is like oh I don't know
why did stupid so that this is why
should never react in like a negative
way but I grat I grabbed him not put him
in esto hace yo assess him sighs you
know you dude like he's like no no no so
I run away why why no he's like no I'm
not I'm not dude so I was so close
things like literally like getting so
violent but then Yusuf and and some were
holding back they would tell me chill

running off and screaming stuff like Oh

where you chill at I know where you be
at whatever some like that and I'll tell
you how you can come wherever you know
wherever you think I am it won't be it
won't be fun if you find me

swear I'm so sorry to like spread this
negative energy to you guys but it won't
be fun if I ever see him again I swear
I'll open the vlog camera and I will do
things that I'm not let me tell you but
I got so I got so mad this dude he's the
one that literally almost killed me
this guy's don't want to almost kill me
sucker-punched me to train him and all
his friends I don't know if I got set up
I don't know it was I don't know if if
he knew me someone sent sent him on me
or something like that but it was it was
wild it was wild and stuff like that but
then after Yousef and slim chatter like
only that he was with me right now by
the way say was so he was used when I
was hold me back Wow laughter I was I
was all right so then this would happen
this the worst part so that was already
bad luck cuz I was ready tempted I ended
up going either taking a taxi from Queen
senemo me some use of women taxi I put
my black camera inside the little couch
in the backseat when I put my block
camera there I'm there just like
expressing my feelings to them so like
that and then we took us all the way to
Manhattan at 34th Street we get out in
34th Street I paid cash I do not get no
receipt I do not even remember the guy's
face the driver's face I don't remember
any any of the car or any cars number of
the guy's name so I got at the car I
took my bag and everything and then like
3040 minutes later I remember that my
camera is in the taxi behind like behind
the couch and then I didn't know what to
do so I called 3-1-1 I tried
I looked for the lost-and-found they
told me to wait about three four days to
call back and to see if it returns but
seriously I think it will not be
returned because it's in the back seat
and the next person who is there they
can just if they're not nice enough they
can just keep the camera all my footage
is in there of the whole vlog my footage
of my dad of the prank is in there but
