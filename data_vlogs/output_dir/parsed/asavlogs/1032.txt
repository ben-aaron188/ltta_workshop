when someone goes to like Arabic school
Islamic school because if you're going
up in American New York you're ready to
get into English you're ready get to
know a lot of American kind of stuff so
when you go to summer school you grow up
into learning a lot of assignments up a
lot of Arabic stuff so you grew up know
bringing your culture together right
