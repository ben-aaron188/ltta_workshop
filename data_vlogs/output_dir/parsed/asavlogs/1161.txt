hey guys what's up good morning it is
day one of Ramadan and I woke up extra
extra early so I'm gonna have a pretty
long day and I'm gonna be extra extra
hungry but it's all good about a week
ago we could go it was a time Adan we
was eating y'all in y'all
now with Ramadan and we ain't young I'm
starving and whoever starving with me
you real MVP so good this is the beauty
of Ramadan a lot of people they're
always like you know complain like oh my
god I get so hungry oh my god I'm
starving to death oh my god but this is
the beauty of this feeling right now I'm
getting right now that you're also
getting if you're fasting that's the
beauty of Ramadan and I'm pretty much
doing something to keep me busy which is
I'm making sambusa not samosa sambusa so
get it straight
I'm making a hundred now I'm not making
150 right now making 200 some who says I
remember last year I made 150 symbol
says my mom went crazy because she told
me I had to eat it all so I gotta eat
the flick the floor or something like
that by making 200 someone I'm just make
it as much as I can discuss um just cuz
like I need some time to pass by so but
I'm gonna keep these samosas for the
whole throughout the whole month and
it's good it feels good to help your
parents so if you guys want always help
your parents cook because your parents
are always one cooking the most during
Ramadan so it's good to help them out
chill out you know I'm saying so I'm
making some sambal set with this meat
and cheese and I probably won't make the
chocolate one cuz that was a fail I'll
try to think of a new invention and see
how it goes
