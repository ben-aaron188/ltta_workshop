Ramadan yes I know
it's nice you know some of that I didn't
know what's wrong with that you know now
I know some 22 2010 was like fasting yes
yeah you got a fast for 30 days you know
the reason why I got a fast that fast
was like what do you think would be the
reason to just not you just suffer
yourself you want to suffer yourself no
it's really you know people like the
poor people they always got to go
through every single day so if we go
through it for a month just to see how
they would feel and to give back in our
angle I want to go all the way on the
top like I want to go all the way up

is a hold on the camera you have your
face hold that angle now I'm not gonna
like Detroit pretty good it's pretty
chill I should have never judged it like
that everybody would just tell me he
stopped then I ain't around montseny cuz
maybe if I go to the hood hood but they
try any hood that's anyway yeah but
Detroit I like your shirt they tried
pretty cool
