appreciation I know you guys you guys
probably heard this a lot like you guys
probably heard people saying oh
appreciate like this and I blah blah
blah but you know it's something that
should be should be said more I noticed
a lot of people that don't appreciate
like that don't appreciate anything like
when they have a lot of money they want
more they they go $100 come on I want
more like $100 there are people in this
world who would do anything to see that
on the others who who would do anything
to have that hundred dollars do their
whole life would be made if they had
that on your dollars and you're
complaining about having the hajjali
I know people who complain about they go
oh my eyes are so small oh my hair is
messed up oh my ears are so big there
are a lot of people in this world who
cannot see who cannot hear who cannot
talk who have no hair who cannot grow no
here what's the point of complaining
about all this there are people who
would do anything literally anything to
see the world to see the cars drive to
see the trees with the wind blowing
trees there are people who would do
anything to hear who who can hear the
birds the birds making sound you know
there are people who are like that and
you're complaining about it
you have to thank God that you have
these futures these people there are
people that don't have these features
you know you add every moment you should
thank God you should appreciate life
because everyone is in a different level
not all the people aren't seen well just
know that the level you're in you should
appreciate that because the people below
you are struggling to be on your level
so you know all I'm trying to say is
appreciate life and you know stop
complaining move on with your life but
with the appreciation like with move on
with which we have what God gave you
don't try to don't try to go
don't try to beg for more like complain
about what you have use what you have
and and and you know improve on it
don't don't complain about it because
you know it there are people that wants
what you have another thing is if you
have money in your pocket and you're
walking and you see you homeless people
and stuff it doesn't hurt to give them
$1.00 it doesn't hurt to give them food
it doesn't hurt to to give them a smile
especially in this weather right now in
New York City the weather is freezing
and there's a lot of homeless people in
the streets who are struggling who put
on who put on like Jack is that they had
from ten years ago the thick of
themselves up your dollar can make a
difference to them that dollar they can
save up slowly slowly and buy a new
jacket they they can improve on that one
dollar you know that smile of yours
could make their day thicken it can warm
up their body the stuff you do for
people it will come back to you there's
a homeless person from you and you walk
past him with that even if you have a
lot of money but you walk past it and
you don't give him anything someone in
life will do the same exact thing for
you when you're in need no one will help
him so that's why you should always help
each other and be appreciative of what
you do have and live life but appreciate
life
don't complain because there are people
below you who would try to who would do
anything to be on yellow
you know just one word is appreciate
also you guys are you guys saying that
