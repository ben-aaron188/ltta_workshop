their Dunkin Donuts of the day behind me
as you can see is three cars that has
been hit by each other witness here we
have a big bucket that has been going
through can you in the situation
oh yeah I just been usin the light and
get ball Kilauea
no response witness to say victim was
just sitting down waiting for the light
when a car hit her from the back how
many times did he call the cops twice
the last half hour and they didn't come
I ain't gonna send somebody Wow I'm
gonna censor there's a recent frosting
two blocks away but they have not came
in the past 30 minutes look this car in
that car become a traffic there is down
there laser
that was shaker card from a nice big
city
today's rent is gonna be about age
differences and relationships what I'm
about to say is my opinion it's I'm not
talking in behalf of anyone who just saw
on behalf of me it's what I feel I feel
that age is not that important in
relationships it's it's because I
believe people it's the mentality and
the behavior and it's the maturity that
counts like if there's a girl who's
who's actually 21 for her mentality to
her mind is of a 17 year old and there's
a guy who's 18 and his mentality is of a
21 year old that would be a good couple
that's just an example that would be a
good couple because people in the
streets and I must stop you and say oh
what's your age you're too young for him
you're too old then I don't say that
it's it's what they can see it's what
you show them like if like if the guy he
acts like a little kid while the girl
isn't the girl is very mature it just
you know it's just it doesn't work out
it's supposed to be like both mature or
the guys would be the manliest one the
relationship that's what matters it's
about what society sees you at but for
marriage it's a different story
the guy can be 28 and the girl coming 21
day seven years apart but that seven
years say they didn't get married they
would they're dating that seven years
would look awkward like the 20 year old
28 year old old guy dating a 21 year
when choosing someone it don't choose by
age choose by maturity level and choose
by choose by the mindset because that's
what that's what really matters the most
because that's what counts
it's all about year
and here I think the decide all right in
here can can a celebrity or can someone
famous or someone on YouTube marry
someone art or date one of their fans
yes they can love can happen anytime
anywhere with anyone like you can you
can be anyone and you can still get grab
the attention of someone somewhere
beginning that's the death spirit of
love alright I'm not a Love Guru I don't
know much about love but everything I
know I I I'm saying this video
everything I feel everything I expressed
is in this video so don't take it to
heart if if if there's something you
disagree not comment below you can
comment anything you want it won't
affect me it just
