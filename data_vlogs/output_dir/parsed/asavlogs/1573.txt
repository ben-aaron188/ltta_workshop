Jerzy cannot believe what the hell just
happened
I just left Dunkin Donuts to get free
Wi-Fi and you guys probably watch the
videotape Sunday so share the freaking
assaulted him then arrested him just for
grabbing the guy who actually grabbed it
like three times but he wasn't supposed
to even grab him like that so thank God
I had the footage I took out the memory
card that I had then I put up the other
other vlog memory card inside so when
the cops are checking it when the
security guard called the cops and they
were checking it to see what footage he
had they only saw nothing was basically
the plot in the vlog stuff live like and
earlier but they didn't find nothing
hopefully everything's gonna be fine so
make sure you guys go check out the
video for guys hasn't checked it out but
yeah I'll supposed to sleep over his
house today and edit the video together
but then this happened I don't think I'm
allowed in Cheryl's house since it's
probably going to be my fault
you know our parents are they blame the
other child for their problems and stuff
but yeah hopefully he'll be out a day or
two that's what the lawyer said and

president as he said he wants to be
white president cuz you always say you
want to be President your name is shake
hug but you need to change your name to
like Johnny Abraham I like when people
were asking they were telling me why
didn't I jump in why didn't I do
something why was that continual
recording I kept I kept recording
because I wanted to continue record
because to have evidence and to have
stuff and I did I wasn't gonna jump in
if I jumped in and hit him I woulda got
myself in trouble too I would've got
arrested too and they would have had no
footage for you guys and no nothing so
and plus I've been in a lot of trouble
so I didn't want to go in there and he
seemed like the type to arrest me even
if I'm trying to stop it
so I was trying to get his phone to call
his mother or to call the cops on him
