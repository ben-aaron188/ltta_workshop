nothing that kid can't do he went from
controversial pranks to family-friendly

shout out to Lee oh man I lost want to
say a big happy birthday to Leo today's
his birthday I love you so much I do not
have no kids nothing at all I'm a single
person with no kids
I don't know how information like this
goes around I mean me and Adam Sandler's
name are pretty similar but a lot of
people get us mixed up we're not he's an
actor he's he's way beyond you know he's
a legend but yes I have no kids video
for Beckett 2016 when Adam informed his
audience about his son oh my god this is
an April Fool's pig
Oh oh my god yeah no I honestly don't
really know what's going on this has
been one of the tougher videos to write
you know
let's move on let's talk about his
childhood oh my the young kid out of
showcase that he had huge ambition he
would regularly tell his parents that he
was one day by the madhouse now to do
this she would have to get to work so 14
he got his first job as a delivery boy
yes 12 hours I was the fastest delivery
boy was 80 to 90 dollars a day I don't
give every single penny to my mom and
then they would get so so happy
I work as a delivery boy for about a
year or two then after a while I quit
his family didn't have a lot of money
and his father was already nearing the
age of retirement so young Adam would
share his earnings with his rather large
family that we sounds like the perfect
kid but Adam was up to no good in his
spare time he claimed that in an
Instagram post at 14 he was getting in
trouble almost every day for fight you
know this might have been something to
do with the difficulties he faced in
school while attending Central Park East
High he was constantly bullied by his
classmates I never went to Central Park
East High Google please change that man
I went to Manhattan Center for science
and mathematics that's the school that I
went to in Harlem Manhattan sensor not
such a park is a completely different
school he'd one friend who stopped
talking to him altogether after
witnessing that his mother wore a
headscarf and speaking on this matter
out of stated people were bullying me
because I was Muslim at one point I was
even afraid to admit I was Muslim
always
making videos it motivated me and
started the bake be proud I must I was
only with Mimas Guney figured a way to
put his talents for brawling to some
good use okay he developed an interest
of boxing it was convinced that this was
his path to fame and fortune will know
despite his mother fearing for his
safety he signed up for classes and soon
enough he was competing in tournaments
feeding his first 13 contenders what
okay don't see the note okay man that
you won't take your training out into
the streets when seventeen Adam found
himself in an altercation and due to his
boxing experience he was charged with
assault with a deadly weapon
yes though this put an end to his boxing
career and from there on out he was a
little lost he didn't know what he's
gonna do next but he was tight but the
guy still had huge aspirations he
decided to toy around on YouTube so
let's take a look back at some of his
videos from 2008 alright these videos
we're not on YouTube these were on my
tape I was not youtuber back then 2008 I
was just doing dumb videos on my ceiling
what about doing bro I would kill myself
man like I'm trying to throw myself off
the bridge don't ever what that oh my
god
what was I thinking I'm an idiot
initially added we get a buzz off a
couple views in a single comment and
this inspired him to continue posting to
the platform I'll still do my title
dance dare competition and she
encouraged her fans to sneak up behind
people and dance behind them without
getting caught and then throw like this
so he got to work on his entry
that's that elapsed oh oh oh that's me
both Adam and Susie became finalists and
were invited onto the Ellen Show now I'm
not entirely sure if anyone was crowned
the official winner Malone abusive will
they earned the title of finalists and
they have that in common
and so much more they were also beefing
anyway yes at the time I mean Lucy were
beefing but it was just childish beef
but now he is my homey he's like my
older brother I'm like his little
brother we're actually doing a tour
together called Adam eats pussy tour so
make sure you guys get your tickets to
do me gang UK Australia Indonesia
Malaysia Singapore get your tickets
big boost across his various active
platforms he got back to work making
more videos and decided to use YouTube
as it means to spread a positive message
and about being Muslim one of his
earliest videos included one which he
prayed in public Wow as you put that is
really good
one of the reasons why I started doing
video is related to Islam you know me
being Muslim is because I went through a
lot of not telling anyone that I'm
Muslim I was the only Muslim on school
so I didn't want anyone to know so when
I started YouTube I wanted to bring that
I wanted the world to know that I'm
Muslim and I'll keep on doing that
fabric because I just felt really guilty
not telling anyone in hiding so I wanted
to make sure that everyone knows and I
wanted to spread positive messages to
the world that Islam is peace and it
probably felt like high school all over
again criminal justice different school
BMCC and then this was my first ever
video and the blood channel which he
posted in May of 2013 all of a sudden
the video was getting shared by the
likes of Channing Tatum and Wiz Khalifa
yeah weird things progressing so quickly
out of decided to drop out of college to
focus solely on his YouTube career kids
do not drop out of college
do not drop out of school that was a
really dumb decision of mine to do but
Heimdall I did get lucky for it to be my
full-time job not just YouTube also so
much other things and I'm little I'm
grateful and blessed I'm thankful to be
in this position right now and I would
it be this position would I do be gang a
new story involving Delta Airlines
I'll start speaking to slim in Arabic
and this is where the issue I guess what
people had an issue and medium was
speaking Arabic there was this lady for
seats in front of us she looks back and
she says can you please speak English I
feel really uncomfortable and it means
slim were just shocked adam claimed that
he was first thrown off the plane for
speaking arabic this
in public outrage via Twitter and a ton
of hate was des in Delta Airlines
direction celebrities including Olivia
Wilde will they shared their disgust
Coakley came forward stating that Adam
was removed for disturbing the cabin
with provocative behavior including
shouting boom let me stop it here one of
the biggest BS misconceptions is the
whole Delta issue I will be telling my
fool everything little detail every
second of it when my movie documentary
comes out the one I told you guys about
we're like Trump supporters people who
are against Muslims went to Egypt and
explore the real Muslim world I
explained it in that movie documentary
but yes me slim we did get kicked out of
the plane for speaking Arabic and it's
not like we spoke Arabic and they said
hey you gotta leave we spoke Arabic and
the lady felt really uncomfortable and
at the time there was like a big bomb in
Europe which I had no clue about and
then the lady that felt uncomfortable
her husband her man he got up he's like
I don't feel comfortable either
and then another lady got up then
another guy got up and then when the
captain came he seen literally ten
people on me and slim he didn't ask us
no questions he just do me getting my
other camera just died I have to get my
old camera Bazo seeing the captain of
delta of the flight he ended up kicking
me and slim out some of us to leave
he'll give us another fly didn't ask us
any questions didn't tell us what
happened he literally just told us to
leave and as you can see in the video
that I made when I said we're being
kicked out for speaking Arabic Delta
every customer in there did not say a
word they never said hey you guys was
shouting so then Delta like eight hours
later they finally came up with an
excuse because they found out that I've
done pranks and they use that against me
so then the whole meter turned on me and
literally I was filled with hate I would
be straight-up honest if I was loud if I
was screaming I wouldn't joke about
something like this imagine if it was my
mom in there you guys gonna kick the rod
no one would have knew nothing after
that they had many many many more issues
of them kicking people out even babies
but yes the dumi gang they kicked us out
for speaking Arabic and Delta fuck you
speaking about this decision he stated
some people may not have known me or
been fans of the social media stuff that
I do so maybe now with the music do me
game that was the video I tried my best
to clear out literally everything in
that video that was wrong but yes that
was it do me a few guys enjoyed it make
