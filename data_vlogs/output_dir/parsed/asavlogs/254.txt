long time okay he knows the words okay -
like a boss you don't let me give up
looks like he's liking it okay every
girl is in Champaign Missoni so that's
like a normal thing now all these roses
pushed Alex Campbell is like pagers link
pretty much you're going most you're
almost like private serials nowadays
mission exactly when set that's
basically the concept of the whole video
that everyone is like you know he'll do
anything for Instagram you know what I'm
saying like if you see the video you'll
understand and even towards the end like
the pilot comes and it shows that that's
not our private jet so show that people
on Instagram wouldn't do anything to you
know to be Instagram thing that's pretty
much watch the concept of the video
thank you so much that's too man let's
go good boxing skills I was just
throwing a punch because I'm the beat a
little more like like you're just drunk
I was like but I thought trying to show
off my boxing skills I would be at the
boxing gym you know what I'm saying and
I'm not trying to fight kiss I I want to
fight him and he wants to fight me too
but he has taken the money fight so I
guess Logan Paul is gonna handle my leg
work but let's continue onto video
torn down the awesome brother I can hear
from here and the bondsman loud
oh my god oh my god oh my god doing it
she said tow it down to Ottawa to not
say yeah I don't really care
matter of fact I know there's auto-tune
in there and tomorrow everyone's on my
duty and you guys know I rarely put
auto-tune in my music for this so I
always gonna put no order to it I was
gonna put my regular voice because I can
I rap I can do my regular voice so we
decided to do it a little different and
to make it sound a little different I'm
kind of like a Fetty WAP I don't know if
it's like a fit of like kind of like
well people do these days literally 95%
everyone puts on the tune so like saying
that there's auto-tune doesn't it like
it doesn't like faze me or nothing like
that
I don't whine I know there's auto-tune
there but ah thank you so much heavy I
appreciate yo that means so much
seriously thank you so much I know a lot
of youtubers upload music but I feel
like when I upload my music I gotta make
sure like with my whole management team
they make sure that it sounds good and
credible like people will actually
listen to it and not something like a
parody or nothing like that it's
something that you know I can perform on

smile man it keep somebody with the
theater like that I bet they're rich
because like rich people always have
that beer like look super rich what the
actually is rich this dude is funny man
I don't know how a beer can make you
look rich or not if anything I felt like
that beard made me look I don't know
just I felt like they made it hide my
face and that's why I trimmed it down a
bit but I guess as long as you know you
have a rich personality because that's
that's what means the most you know

rich screw viewport it all matters
