feel like I haven't been having an
amazing day especially today today's a
really scary day for me because my dad
is having a surgery and the surgery that
he's happening the doctors told me that
he's at risk and he has a really weak
heart so I'm really really scared I do
not care about traveling I do not care
about nothing right now all I care about
is my father and the only reason why I'm
vlogging is because I feel like this
platform that I have you guys you guys
can help me out by praying for my dad
and being there with him so I'm heading
to the doctor right now
he's doing his surgery right now I
believe he should be out in around 20-30
minutes the doctors are not letting me
in until he's done and go into the
recovery room so I'll keep you guys
updated do me yank by the way he's going
to a different doctor because the last
doctor that he wants who they do not
care at all so this time he's at a
doctor in Brooklyn so please please guys
