one time soon Times Square I'm talking
about a different country man this
dude's at Times Square
wow so crazy how his world is only New
York City but ok I'll take you to Times
Square and I'll tell you guys the whole
story about what happened last midnight
I'll see you guys in the next shot okay
do me yank so as you guys know as it
says in the title it says I almost got
robbed by my own uber driver so let me
tell you guys the full story and listen
carefully because this might be
happening all around the neighborhood
maybe all around the city it was around
midnight and this was last night I had
to go to the pharmacy to get medicine
for my mom and then after that go back
home and give the medicine to my mom so
I took it over from Hamzah's house all
the way to the pharmacy it was a good
seven to ten minutes away because I had
to look for a pharmacy that's open till
that late so while I was in the Ober my
camera was right next to me and my 2k
was right next to me and then I told my
uber driver hey can I go inside the
forum see and come back within two
minutes and then you'll take me back
home he told me yes and he told me hey
man keep yourself in the car don't I'll
take care of it you don't have to carry
your brother assalamualaikum I'm Muslim
- he was trying so hard to make me like
trust him it's like an idiot I trusted
him and then I went inside to get the
medicine I come back out and the uber is
not there it's gone my camera was in the
car my two K 18 was in the car and they
do it has it I was literally out for two
minutes out to over I come back and he's
completely gone so I tried calling him
using the uber app and it would take me
to him but he wouldn't pick up I called
him around 30 to 40 times I was
literally on my phone for like a whole
hour just calling him and he was not
picking up at all so then I ended up
doing a big report to over like a really
big report tuber and then two hours
later two hours that I didn't have my
camera or my two K's and then somehow
customer service connects me with him
and he picks up and I was on the phone
with him on my brother hey it's me I
left my camera at my 2ke his voice
started cracking itself he's like
brother it was you what happened why are
you and at that time I'm already home
and I told him I'm like please come and
bring my camera and my 2k then here you
pop back he's like yes I can combat
it'll take me 20 to 25 minutes and
you're gonna have to tip me brother so
at that time I'm already so so angry
because he was claiming that I cancelled
the ride I never cancelled the ride
because I never went on my phone that's
how I know he was lying and then I go on
his account and I look at his reviews
and this was the icing on the cake one
of the reviews said this this dude
through the same thing to this person
right here and there was a lot more
views of people saying the same thing by
looking at his reviews and by him
telling me hey you need to give me a tip
just shows that this dude is an uber
hustler and I didn't like that because I
don't like people who rob or steal from
people so I was telling him on the phone
I'm like please come brother yes I'll
tip you except you however much you want
okay give me 50 so I was so so angry I
was waiting for him to come he ended up
coming and this is how I approach him I
wanted to see his reaction when I saw
him why didn't you pick up my calls so
when I did approach him he reacted in a
crazy yelling matter
I came at him straight back young thug
Adam ended up having to come out because
I do not I do not like people doing that
stuff especially when he told me
assalamu alaikum brother i'm Muslim like
what am I supposed to do it I supposed
to oh my god that's it your muscle I'm
gonna trust you and this is the clip I
apologize for using bad words in this
video but just when I was tempted and
this dude literally attempted to rob me
and I did already reporter 2 over but I
decided to share it with you guys so you
guys can probably be careful do not
leave yourself inside ubers but this is
the video huh ok give me my toolkit
thingie and why you lied huh why didn't
you pick up me like that again so yeah
that's pretty much what happened I've
told my mom the whole story this is the
first time and the only time that mom
