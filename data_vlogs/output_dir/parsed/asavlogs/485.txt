we are on a boat right now we're on the
same boat that I posted on my Instagram
this guy named Thomas basically this is
his story he's 70 years old he has six
kids he lives 10 hours away from Cairo
so every month he comes to Cairo for a
month to work on a boat and he only
makes like 30 pounds 30 different pounds
so he's over 30 to 70 Egyptian pounds
which is like 5 bucks a day so I asked
him like where do you sleep when he
stayed here month he told me that he
sleeps in the boat which is really
really sad then I ended up tipping him
and then he told me let's take a picture
for memory so we took a picture of
marriage and I decided to post it on my
Instagram just so anyone else who's from
Peters can also tip him and you know
give him some cash
conceded the kids because it reminded me
of my dad my dad has six kids that are
kind of reminding him and by the way
sorry for the all the noise Egypt's and
just really really loud and I was
telling you that India is even louder
it's that loud mouth oh this is nothing
it's loud and easy look it's always
something so I'm sorry for any
background music in Egypt it's the only
