gang I'm back here at my apartment in
London I'm going to talk to you guys
about something really personal it
involves my family my parents marriage
you guys me I started YouTube at the age
of 18 I was 18 years old when I started
YouTube but my older brother got married
at 18 so my parents were going insane
because you know the smaller brother has
always going to follow the older brother
the older brother got married at 18 so I
should get married at the age of 18 but
I didn't want to I did it I wasn't ready
and I just I just did it once I just
thought was it dumb idea that's really
too young I'm Way too young I still have
like a lot of like life to live and like
getting married it's like a whole
different life but so I told my parents
no I'm just going to continue YouTube I
do not want to get married and I'm not
gonna lie I kind of got them you know
kind of like mad at me but after a while
they started being really supportive of
you know me doing YouTube and having
videos it started noticing you know how
passionate I am within sort of noticing
how like you know I created a whole fan
base I would go out doing shows I
inspire so many people I made so many
people smile so they saw that side and
they appreciated it so much so I was so
happy because my parents got so
supportive the whole family got
supportive they're always there for me
every single day but the thing is almost
every single day they would talk to me
about getting married but I didn't want
to get married because I'm doing YouTube
and why would I like it'll take away
focus so I wasn't ready to get married
so around the age of 18 till now I'm 23
years old now I've been getting like
marriage talk every single day every
single leg my mom and dad would tell me
oh you're scared you don't want to get
married you're scared because your fans
are going to see it you're taking mine
do me yank this and that no you have to
get married I'm like mom no I'm not you
know worried or so I'm just really
curious and that's when I came up with
the idea of making the video saying I'm
getting married I really wanted to see
like everyone's reaction and everyone
was really you know everyone was really
supportive everyone is really nice and
that made me feel so much better because
if I actually did get married you guys
would be supportive so since I know that
you guys are supportive I can probably
tell you guys that I'm single but my
parents are talking to me about getting
married and stuff I do not have anyone
to get married I don't know who or
nothing like that I mean I do have a
couple people in mind but I don't know I
told my mom and dad I do not want to get
married yet I want to get a house first
for all of us like a really big house
which I am getting in a couple months
this year I'm getting a house and then
after that we can focus on the marriage
talk after me my family get all of our
freedom and our space in the house we
get then I get talked to my mom and dad
about marriage so the reason why I'm
single is because of youtube yup
I'm single because of YouTube and cuz of
a dooming eggs I'm taken by a dummy game
but a dummy gang there will be one day I
do not know when maybe in a couple
months where I get married but I will
still continue YouTube I will still have
a do me hang by my side and I will still
be by your side and do me getting every
single day and I'll show you guys the
mini Adams and I'll take you guys
through the journey of me getting
married because I'm getting the house
really really soon like we're going
house shopping once I would go back to
New York City so it's sooner than you
think it'd do me Hank it's really sooner
than you think my parents already like
coming up with these people in their
head obviously get married soon if you
get married and I'm already thinking
like we should get that out so she goes
out which they aren't because I want to
choose who I want to marry
that is Kim Canova Sh I want Kim Canova
Sh so expect in a couple days or a
couple weeks a lot of marriage talk I
