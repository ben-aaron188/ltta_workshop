here I decided here talk to you guys
about what I did before YouTube because
a lot of you are curious but I'm a rider
that do me know what I did before
YouTube but you guys don't know the full
story the stuff that I went through to
like literally make money for my family
growing up my family didn't have much we
barely had anything we barely had any
money to like give each other Chloe
barely had enough money for anything to
even go out to like the park to travel
to go out and eat my mom had no job my
dad worked in a store and barely made
anything and we had literally no
business
it was so hard when I was younger I know
a lot of people had a worse but with me
compared to like everyone else like in
my generation my family was like
consider like the pores like the most
the poorest family like we were known as
like these people they don't have money
they suck they're they're losers they
have no money I thought Adams dad he
doesn't do anything like that so I have
to suffer every single day seeing my dad
suffer seeing him walk work 15 hours a
day 16 hours a day seven days a week
every single day I just always telling
like that one day when I grow up I'm
gonna give you like money every single
day one day when I grow up I'm gonna buy
you a car one day when I grow up I'm
gonna buy you a house and he was I Adam
inshallah inshallah we'll see we'll see
how it goes and I continued on just
going to school working hard and I was
like known as the kid to be like who's
really smart in school because both of
my brothers got left back my sisters
were all married so everyone was relying
on me all the pressure was on me I was
literally working hard at the age of 10
I had my first job my first job was to
pack bags I had a bag and whatever they
buy always put it in and just go like
that I'll fix it up and I'll give it to
them that was my job at the age of 10 in
America you can't work until you're 14
years old if you're working under the
age of 14 is considered child labor and
you can get like your parents can get in
big trouble or you can get a big trouble
for that and it's illegal it was my
choice I wanted to go work because my
parents were making literally nothing
they had no money nobody wants to help
us so and I felt like you know it was my
responsibility at the age of
to go out and do something my dad was at
the age of 10 my dad was like
50-something he was still old even when
I was at the age of 10 I went to go pack
bags and it wasn't like a job where like
the older like hired me or anything like
that's a job where like the first people
who make it to the supermarket you're
gonna be there are you gonna work there
so there were some days I wake up so
early
travel an hour and a half way to the
supermarket because it was one of my
family members supermarket and sometimes
I could even pack back as a work because
there will be kids there cursing me out
saying I came here first and then I have
to leave and go back an hour and a half
back away home and when I go home I
would seriously feel so down so
depressed and I'll go tell my parents
like I couldn't work I try to go and
there's people work and I'll come back
my parents you liked or about it it's ok
hopefully next time you can make it
there even earlier I still rely on
making tips that was my only income
nobody none of the workers there paid me
another owners never paid me I had to
rely on the customers tipping me people
would tip me 10 cents 20 cents and it
meant the world to me because I stayed
out of all the money a nice to make
around like 20 to 30 dollars a day if I
would you know work there and I worked
for 12 hours I would go straight home
I'll give half my money to my mom and
half my money to my dad and there would
be so so happy even though it wasn't
much for them the fact that I would go
all out to the work and give them my pay
there would be the happiest parents ever
I've never had a vacation with my family
in my life like my whole childhood I've
never had a vacation we couldn't afford
no vacation or no nothing at all and it
killed me inside because I'll see my
cousins their family going like Miami
Orlando or like having this crazy
Washington DC vacations I like that and
I'll be stuck home in New York City
doing nothing just laying down looking
to make some more money for my family
there was one day I went to go pack bags
I'm packing bags I made it there early
and there was a kid you can't see me as
like hey man let me work you're too
young to work anyways let me pack mine
dude was like 20 years old I don't like
that please like I can still pack bags
to like I'm even though I'm 10 I can
still pack bags and try to make money
like for my family just like how you're
trying to make money I want to work too
I didn't let him work because I didn't
want to have then he ended up calling
the police on me and saying that my
parents forced me to work and they're
giving me like
labor and they're forcing me as a slave
the cops literally came to the
supermarket what to me and told me I had
to leave I'm tweeting up to work I'm not
allowed to be here
you need to leave right now I cried that
day I have to go on from the train and
Howard half from Brooklyn all the way to
Manhattan I was crying the whole ride it
was the saddest thing ever because my
parents weren't forcing me and I told
the cops I was like they're not they're
not forcing mother you need to go right
now before we drop you home have to stop
working at the supermarket I say hey to
my parents used to feel like I don't
hopefully you can get married and we can
see your kids before you died I hated
that word die die die but our mothers
our dads they use it like it's like ass
normal so at the age of 14 I became a
delivery man I was 14 I was you know
what I can work at the age of 14 I want
to go work with my cousin's so shout out
to my cousins for letting me work I want
to go work and I was like you know what
I'm gonna work hard every weekend
Saturday and Sunday I worked 12 hours
and was the fastest delivery boy ever so
a lot of people took me really good I
used to make around 80 to 90 dollars a
day and I'll give every single penny to
my mom and then they would get so so
happy I worked as a delivery board for
about a year or two and then after a
while I quit I quit and I decided to
become a boxer I'm like mom I'm gonna
become a boxer and I'm gonna make
millions of dollars and I'm gonna buy my
dad a car and I'm gonna buy like us a
house so I'm gonna do this and my mom
refused she begged me not to be a boxer
my dad was supporting me he like that um
go you got this I believe in you I had
my first boxing match
I won not like the kid I had my second
boxing match I won again and I'm like
the kid again I was on a roll knocking
kids out I had my third boxing match I
won I won my first 13 boxing matches but
the only bad thing about boxing and
being an amateur boxer was like all the
bruises I had all the bloody noses I had
all the bloody shirts I had my mom hated
it my mom used to come to my boxing
fights and like literally cry she's to
pray she's a scream I'm not walking my
soul out and I know you know Americans
don't like they don't know what that
means so when they hear that they're
like looking around and I'm there
fighting
listening to my mom my only
and this truly like truly like it's like
I don't know I was like so hard because
right now I have so many have so many
fans have so many do me again right now
I had only two fans my brothers and
sisters were always at home or at school
so my mom and dad were always at my
fights and the other the opponent that
would fight they would have so many fans
they had about hundreds of people
screaming for them hundreds of people
saying the names so when I would have my
boxing fights all I hear is bullying and
all I hear is my mom and that screaming
at me same telling me what to do each
fight I had I was the most hated person
there but to be honest I made me even
stronger it made me like to me to like
this tiger this this line I was like a
robot like a machine because I would
hear everyone screaming for the kid and
no one screaming for me just my mom and
just my dad so it truly like I felt it
and I would look to the right oh I see
my mom I've seen my dad I look at the
referee I look at the guy who announced
in the names you were like Adam Sally it
was silent silence whatever my name was
spoken nothing it wouldíve crickets
nothing you can hear the opponent's name
screams going on so I was there just
like stuck I'm like literally sucking
around everybody who hated me just me my
parents I would give it my all like I
had to knocking that kid out beating
them up again that win was another step
closer to trying to be a professional
boxer making millions of dollars and
becoming a having like this big business
and making my name of business in the
boxing world like Floyd Mayweather at
the age of 16 17 I had this fight and it
was wasn't a good decision that I had
because I just always find the street
and this fight went online in a website
called worldstar some of you guys may
have watched it but it made me get my
boxing license taken away and it ruined
my whole career in boxing I could never
have any boxing fight anymore because I
got caught twice fighting in the street
and that was it to be honest it wasn't
my fault fighting the street because
this kid brought his mom his uncle his
family the mother forced me to fight her
own son what kind of mother forces their
son to fight so I have to fight the kid
I knocked him out I got a big
I got arrested because I had a license
and I got charged for assault with a
deadly weapon because when you do boxing
you sign a contract and then that
contract says if you punch someone who
has someone you get charged for assault
with a deadly weapon because your hands
are considered weapons so I got my
license taken away and at that time I
was literally at the lowest point of my
life I had no job no boxing my boxing
career is done I couldn't go back to
being a delivery boy because they hired
someone else I couldn't go back to
packing bags because it was just so
embarrassing and I would make nothing I
was around 17 years old and I would make
10 20 dollars for him go packing back so
I had literally nothing my mom was so
depressed my dad was so depressed
my dad could have worked on one because
he was so old he's turning at the age of
60 he retired he was he has social
security other the government would give
my mom and dad money because we had
nothing I don't know if you guys noticed
but like like there's something I'm
gonna say and it's like there's
something I don't know there's something
there's something like about like my
family that I want to stay so bad I'm
not gonna say yeah I'm gonna wait until
until like I don't know I'm gonna wait
it's like the right time so hopefully
until I feel right I can tell you guys
but so I was like you know what I'm
gonna switch my life around I'm gonna be
me i'ma be I'm not gonna I'm tired of
being the way I am to impress other
people that impress my friends to beat
up someone and I pressed my first I'm
gonna I'm gonna try to do something I
remembered at the age of around 12 to 13
years old I used to make videos like my
family to watch I said personate my mom
and dad and I said let them watch it
like through my phone nice like
impersonate my mom and like make make
funner and like in a funny way and she
would have loved it so much so I'm like
hmm that's like let me try this thing
called YouTube because I heard about you
so let me try this thing called YouTube
I made a YouTube channel and I decided
to just I don't know make funny videos
try to make people smile so I used to
have one view and like 10 subscribers
and seeing one comment meant the world
to me like it meant so much seeing a
positive calm
someone saying well man you're amazing
keep it up people will curse me out
they'll be Adam stop doing you're making
a fool of yourself you're never gonna
make it you're never gonna go there just
just quit continue on what you're doing
with your school and just don't even do
YouTube's that made me want to go even
harder so I did this thing called the
Ellen's dance there and I was one of the
finalists in Ellen's dancer Ellen flew
me out to air show
that was one of my biggest achievements
doing that and and then coming back to
New York and continuing on videos I
started growing a little fan base and I
started calling them a duma gang and
then I continued to making videos here
and there I started making vlogs I
started making more videos and I see it
I started seeing my viewers going up I
started seeing my subscribers going up
then I did this video I was one of the
first people I needed to make this
homeless video make the homeless smile
Channing Tatum shared it was Khalifa
comments it everybody started sharing it
I started blowing up hundreds of
thousand views hundreds of thousands of
subscribers and I couldn't believe it I
was so thankful it was a moment where I
had to take the opportunity to leave
school leave college and do full-time
YouTube just just for my family I
continued on doing that I put all my
heart I put my freakin passion my
dedication into this I did everything I
was known as the guy like oh my god I'm
like you made it you made it man but I
still felt like I couldn't make it have
to continue on you know making my family
happy so I continued on being happy I
continued on making you guys happy and
to see you guys going through whatever
stress you have being away into
brightening up all your day so I
continued making vlogs I started making
daily vlogs every single day because I
enjoyed it I still have a diary when I
was younger so I'm like you know what
why not make it like a video diary so I
consider making daily vlogs and I
started having UK tours tours in Europe
shows in New York shows in Toronto
every little money I made from tours
YouTube and like shows what everything I
had I gave it to my mom I gave it to my
dad they one thing with my mom anyway I
gave her she'll donate like 90% to a
message it or like - like a donation
place
everything good that happens in my life
is because of my mom because she makes
so much doubt for me and I truly
appreciate every single thing she does
so thank you so much mom for all your
dad anything with my mom no matter how
much money I gave her if it was a dollar
if it was ten thousand dollars she would
always tell me Adam make sure you stay
real make sure you stay close to it's
not make sure you stay pray and stay
close to your family doesn't matter what
money you get if you whatever money you
have and make that's good as a bonus I
stay close to Allah and stay close to
making your family happy so I'm like you
know what mom I promise you my life I
would always be like that no matter what
age and that was the age of 18 19 now
I'm at the age of 23 and I'm so happy as
I can be I'm too left for everything you
guys it's all you guys you guys Allah my
friends my family is what brought me
here today I even saved up so much money
it took me years to save up to buy my
dad a car and I told my dad I was like
that remember that day when I was
younger when I was around 10 11 years
old and I told you I'm gonna buy you a
car someday he was like yeah I was the
art it's coming soon he didn't believe
me until a couple months later I bought
my dad a car and it was the best feeling
ever and I want to spoil my mom and dad

them when I was younger but they never
got to experience the joy the the the
life for everything that my cousins had
