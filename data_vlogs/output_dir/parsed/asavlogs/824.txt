what is this no rule only vocals so
Hyland times that have this new method
where you know you're not supposed to
listen music learn while you're fasting
but they listen to music without the
music without the instrumentals without
the be set up like that
it listens to it with just vocals so
I'll call Highland this into Zane's
Zanesville album it was just vocals
vocals only and the funny thing is a
couple a couple years ago but I believe
like three four years ago hey Lou she

this is a crazy bedtime story and it
involves my sister so you guys have
never seen my sisters in like video and
if like that I probably showed you guys
about the family tree I have three older
sisters three older sisters so I'm gonna
give you guys I'm gonna tell you guys
how they are so you guys can like image
to like know how like it like what they
are does my oldest sister looks the
youngest my second older sister has the
same exact personality as me literally
the same exact personality as me and the
youngest sister which she sewed older
than me but she's the young sister out
of them all she looks the most like me
like she's literally my clone the one
I'm gonna be talking about today is the
one who looks just like me so when I was
nine years old in the fourth grade every
single day there will be a new bully who
would bully me for no reason well the
reason was because like I was Muslim a
9/11 happened so every single day I
would get bullied and I was the only
Muslim in the whole school literally the
only Muslim in the whole school
including my two brothers so there was
this kid in my class he was the biggest
bully I'm not going to say his name
because I don't know if you even watches
this I don't want to say his name like
that but he was the biggest bully ever
like when I say the biggest bully this
guy was disgusting I do not even want to
say the things he's too
he's matter of fact i'ma tell you that's
one thing but is so disgusting
you guys do not even probably do want to
know i'ma have to tell you guys so you
guys can see what kind of stuff they
used to do to me so this kid he used to
put his finger I'm like I can't believe
I'm saying this but oh my god oh my god
this is like he's to put his finger in
his own butt and his own butt right and
like literally take out like oh my god I
can't say it's so disgusting this is so
so disgusting he's to put his finger in
his butt and he's to come to me like Oh
Adam I got this new cologne man I want
you to smell it like an idiot I am I
used to be way too nice Oh whenever I
hear be nice to me and telling me he
smells come on I'm like hey sure why not
and when I go to smell it this dude
would push his finger in my mouth and it
was the nastiest thing ever and it's not
even like till this day this is probably
one of the most messed up things that
someone has ever done see that's the
kind of disgusting things they used to
do I can seriously go on for days
telling you guys the nasty things they
used to do too but now you guys have an
image of what they used to do to me so
I'm gonna tell you guys something about
me and my sister so my sister was in
junior high school middle school and I
was in elementary school which is the
first second third floor and my sister
was in the fourth floor that's her
middle school and I'm in elementary
school so the kids in my class were
playing a game is called the knockout
game where they just grab like random
people and they put them in a chokehold
and try to knock them out like they
purposely go behind them like without
them knowing and just go really hard
like this until they literally get
knocked out and they just like take
their stuff in their pocket and just run
away that was literally a game like that
was a game that was like a sport for
them and I've seen them do it to so many
kids like little rightful my's they did
it to so many kids in front of my eyes
and the kids were literally like sleep
it would literally be knocked out and
they would just take his cell phone
money it was so worthless like days to
try to steal the money in pocket after
the knock them out it was like a quarter
like he did all that for a quarter like
what you gonna buy a bag of chips what
the heck are you happy like yeah I
Maxima now man just to get you know a
quarter and back I bought a bag of chips
ran off you're happy man so one time at
the end of the class I was ready to go
home around five to ten minutes I heard
the whole class whispering and talking
about knocking me out and putting me in
a choke hold
and basically knocking me out and taking
all the stuff that I had in my pocket I
seriously had just like like two dollars
in my pocket so they're willing to knock
me out put me in the floor for two
dollars so we ready to go home I'm
standing on press set of classmates
standing up I'm just waiting five more
minutes and I'm looking around and I'm
seeing on the lookout like I don't want
no one to grab me or do anything like
that five minutes was up and school was
over and all of us left the classroom so
I was so happy I'm I guess no one got me
I can leave in peace handle and I'll
continued walking so while I was walking
out of school and trying to get out the
building I saw a water fountain so I
started drinking from the water fountain
because we just had gym and I was so
thirsty so while I was drinking from the
water fountain the same nasty bully who
did that little thing that he did of his
button put in our mouth he came right
behind me and grabbed me in a chokehold
it was even worse because I was just
drinking water so I was choking on the
water and I was choking on him choking
me so I was grabbing his here then I'll
screaming sold out I was choking my legs
were up in the air like this and all my
other classmates or should I say bullies
they were waiting for him to like knock
me out so I can get to the floor and
they can take my stuff and I can hear
them I can hear like little echoes
because I was slowly like getting
knocked out can hear little echo saying
do a little harder bro do a little
harder grab it kind of in a pinch point
grab his neck I seriously thought I was
gonna die because all I heard was like
echoes I was seeing black and white just
slowly and smoothly I was slowly dying
it was probably one of the worst
feelings ever because I went from being
alive to slowly like dying into like a
black cloud the bully continues to choke
me up while my legs are up in the air he
continues to choke me up as hard as he
can this bully was in the form of the
great at nine years old but he was
really really big he was a big fourth
grader so he kept choking me as hard as
he can with all the power he had but I
got so so lucky because five to ten
minutes after the elementary school
students leave the middle school people
leave and it was five to ten minutes
after I left so the middle school people
from upstairs are going downstairs and
going home and I got so lucky because
one of those middle school students I
were born downstairs
was my sister in that school I was in
anyone that goes downstairs there's like
a really big window and you can see each
floor I was in the second floor my
sister was in the fourth floor so my
sister was going downstairs from the
fourth floor she went to the third
for that she went to the second floor
and she looked out the window of that
door and she saw around eight people who
are surrounding me and one person who
was choking me up like this I was like
75 80 percent knocked out but I still
see my sister I see my sister so so
clear my sister's looking closely
through the window she's like wait who's
that is that Adam my brother and I'm
looking close he's like screaming for
dear help
so this sister of mine who looks just
like me she's the quiet one she's kind
of quiet so while I'm getting choked up
I'm literally begging all that come do
something come come my sister continues
to look closer she's like wait that's I
know my son brother Adam all I see was
like a black cloud around me and like
the circle getting smaller and smaller
like I can see this like this it was
like this like it started like this and
when you get more knocked out would go
like that like that like that like that
so I was at the point like this I was
like this was looking at my sister when
I was so close to me and knocked out I
seen my sister open the door and I've
never seen this side of my sister she
opened the door she went up to the bully
he was choking me and I'm not even
joking this is all my sister she gave
him that one hitter quitter like his paw
right on the bully's face literally
right on the bully's face got the bully
all the other classmates didn't expect
it because she's a girl but my sister
grabbed me started blowing like air on
me putting some water and I was slowly
coming back to life all the bullies
figured out that I was my sister and
they ran away they seriously ran away
from my sister who was really skinny
really shy and really quiet but she gave
him that one dirty right hook I slowly
come back to life and I'm like wait like
what the hell just happened my sister
just saved my life like I seen darkness
and I'm seeing it like I'm I feel like
I'm about to die the my sister came and
literally saved my freakin life ever
since that day I put some respect
on my sister's name that was my bedtime
story with Adam the theme of this is
anyone who's out there who's young and
you guys get bullied make sure you guys
tell someone or get help from the school
the mistake that I made is that I never
told anyone so I would get bullied every
single day I never told anyone for you
guys what I'm telling you guys tell
someone even if you guys sound like a
snitch even if you guys sound like
you're a punk make sure you tell someone
or else the bully will not stop I'm
telling you this now get help whether it
is a family
number someone from school get help from
someone do not stay quiet stand up to
yourself and it's your life who cares
what they think
so stand up for yourself and most of all
love yourself and don't let no one bully
