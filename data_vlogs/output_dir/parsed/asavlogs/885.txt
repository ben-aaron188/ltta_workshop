brother call me all my three sisters are
calling me my dad is calling me problems

bugging out they're going crazy because
thing is of a home family they always
think of the worst situation possible
which is I feel like it's bad they
should always think positive I mean they
do think positive but whenever I'd do
something crazy which I am kind of a
daredevil other crazy stuff they bug out
on me I go crazy I mean I feel like I'm
back sixteen seventeen years old I
remember when I just do crazy stuff they
used to come and try to stop him
literally like they would stop me but
they can't stop me not because I'm in
the other side of America and mom dad

his truck to go crazy and like spin him
around so it was a crazy crazy
experience and it's all for you guys so
hope you guys enjoyed it thumbs up do me
a game for facing our fears so yeah
we're finally back at our apartment
the place was about two three hours away
from LA and it was so so far we had a
little nap about to meet up with Kai's I
hammered and watched you right now but
we're kind of setting up Kai's right now
hopefully he's pranked her that well and
we're gonna do something I try to pull a
prank on him last time I was here but it
didn't really go well so I came up with
other idea to set him up why he comes
out apartment and I make it think for
some evil evil kids
so while me slim were skydiving I was
trying to pull a crazy crazy prank on
him while we were there and I was trying
to get the instructor to like cooperate
and like work with me I wanted him to
make believe he was like like sick in
the head like you didn't take pills and
he was like had to go like hey man let
me take pills I'm falling asleep so son
come back up so the guy did it for the
first 10 seconds slim bugged out and
went crazy and then they're telling me
that they can't do it and they can't
continue on from it because if they
continue on it's not going to be a good
thing
my bug-out and something that bad but
might happen so he told me I can but
then I try to say it cannot push him off
like the plane as a prank I want to do
like a crazy crazy prank but they didn't
let me but I tried my best because I've
seen some of you guys telling me pranks
limb while skydiving I didn't want to do
it because it's kind of like dangerous
and really hard I tried
then it didn't work out I guess it's
meant to be so what is up we're here I
would say what up
so already filled yeah we're just guys
guys coming in a few and it's going
crazy so I'm gonna yeah that's it
referre I'm ready
definitely laughs or a million thank you
so much we finally got the homie guys
we try to get him last time but was kind
of like a fail so we wanted to light
believe I fell for easily we need it we
needed the help we need the help and
watch it I meant to set him up with this
we may believe that we're gonna film
like a collab video in our apartment and
