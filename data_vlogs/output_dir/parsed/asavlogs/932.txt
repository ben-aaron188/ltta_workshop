another one over over here can you see
it this one I had about four stitches in
this one and this one I basically got
jumped during high school so one of the
seniors the water balloon at me for no
reason no reason at all like he threw a
water balloon at me for no reason like
why can it doesn't have you for no
reason so at those like those days I was
really really bad like it was bad at it
was ratchet bad I'm sorry you know what
this dude threw water balloon at me so
I'm gonna go ten times out of four no
reason so the next day I came back with
water balloons but it wasn't just water
balloons
it was pee balloons I peed inside the
the little water balloons and then I had
it and I was waiting til the guy comes
out and I threw it straight I'm so hard
it splashed all over his friends also so
all his friends came up to me they're
trying to fight me they're like let's
have one-on-one fight so I never having
I went on fight with one of the senior
kids and so I had a one-on-one fight
with him I was winning the fight and
then all the other kids and them jumping
in and beating me up picking me up send
me to the floor they took those little
um they took those orange cones you know
this orange cones that they use for
construction they put it they put it
over me
and they put me in the middle of street
kicked it and I was ready bleeding from
the back of my head and that's pretty
much how I had to go to the emergency
room and get stitches and yet emergency
room was literally like my second home
this one is the last one but it's not in
my head it's on my lip so yeah it's like
that six stitches six stitches on my lip
and it was from the street fight that I
had in high school I had a one own fight
and usually in my school was a really
dated school whenever you have went on
fights and anyone who wins like the
person was winning you end up getting
jumped because since you're winning
everyone every one of their friends they
come in and jump you but then my friends
come in and jump the one who's jumping
me so it turns out to be like a big
brawl I messed him up all over the car
who's all over the floor so while I'm
beating him up but he's messed up one of
his friends jumps in and he needs me
right on my lip like his knee literally
came right on my lip that my lip opened
up over here I was literally opened up
like my life was opened up and then I
was fighting literally like a lip like
that so I had to continue our fighting
than someone else jumped in to beat up
that kid who need me and someone else
jumped in to beat up that kid that beat
up it was literally like a train and I'm
so glad
