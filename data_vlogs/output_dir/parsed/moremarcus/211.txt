going live hey oh hey why so bright
shine bright like a diamond hello hello
hello hello hello hi hi how's everyone
doing today oh I am it this bright
lights really gonna make me forget oh
look at that i mean i'm in dubai if you
didn't know um which is pretty cool it's
my second type well it's my third time
I've technically been here because I've
been to a BW once and I flew into Dubai
but I don't really count that as actual
time in Dubai so it's my second proper
time into why I came once three years
ago all youtubers which you guys
remember which when the flippin a
YouTube boy band was invented that was
invented in Dubai the place I'm in now
and yeah if you guys didn't know how
that was created I should probably we
mean some of you probably all know me
and Joe with sat arms tape we were all
indiana me and Joe was sat there and we
were literally just singing like random
songs to each other and it was really
funny then I was like guys would you be
up for just like singing some songs like
no listen sing just seeing some songs on
a video then everyone was can I yeah and
that is how you too boy band was created
so yeah that's a fun little fact you um
but yeah it's in Dubai it's in Dubai I'm
in Dubai and today has been the first I
got a couple of things to tell you about
today as being the first day in the Sun
because we've been so busy which I'll
tell you about and I've been filming so
much stuff and I really think you guys
gonna like the video when I finally
edited it but what I want a first-year
today's the first day in the Sun and if
I'm being quite honest I think i'm a bit
red that's why I came inside I was like
my think I'm a little bit rude oh I
should probably go
side so first then some and we'll see
how I do this later but also had a bit
of a nightmare today guys so we woke up
this morning at 4am to go and do a hot
air balloon experience so we're going
out into the desert and go up and watch
the sunrise in a hot air balloon sounds
incredible doesn't it like literary
sounds amazing so woke up before I am
like got picked up traveled two hours
and we get there and at the moment in to
buy this this crazy fog in the morning
where to know like it's just really
fogging it depends on how the Sun burns
off to when it gets cleared up and yes
we were on our way there like all this
gonna be amazing and you guys I was a
bit foggy so we're like okay cool that's
fine is that yeah it will clear up and
then I'm get a fucking clear up so they
were like okay we'll take you like we
drove another 30 minutes to a holding
area which was like a petrol station
where you could get food and stuff we
ended up waiting there for an hour and a
half and then they drove us there like
okay it's finally clearing up so we
drove back to where all hot air balloons
where did all the safety I had your
safety belt done and went through all
the training of how to fall and go
introduced to a falcon who knows why so
get really excited at this point and
then they're like and now we just have
to wait five minutes for the fog
focusing and play fucking play cut the
long story short guess what the fuck
didn't clear and they unfortunately had
to cancel it so there was a hundred
people there waiting to go on these
hot-air balloons and because of the fog
yeah they just couldn't couldn't do in
pain and it's no one's fault obviously I
mean the weather the weather is to blame
whoever put this weather on us for this
day thank you very much no um it was
just a bit frustrating so we kind of
woke up at 4am essentially for nothing
and did all that traveling so then we
got back to the hotel like 11 and we're
like oh it's just go go to the Sun a
benign Sun and devised for hours ahead
so it's like for croc now
I've been in the Sun too long so that's
why I came inside our song was like yeah
that's your fault oh thanks yeah okay so
yeah I did it would have been really
cool to do the hot hot air balloon
especially for the film and stuff I'm
doing but you know there's can't do
anything about that so yeah just wanted
to tell you that also you guys in for me
on Twitter and stuff will know that more
markers hit two million subscribers
which is in SE like two million
subscribers on my second channel so
thank you came to thank thank thank you

cheesecake factory now if you've never

every single food in the world and they

come to London that would be so freaking
good because it's amazing because if you
wanna eat healthy you can help if you
want to eat cheese Katie but the best
cheese hey if you want to eat but like
they let you have everything so I'm now
just reading your core when I go silent
like it's not something in my own world
it cuz I'm reading your comments so yeah
any advice for a new traveler whore um
keep keep your ways about you and if
you're going somewhere that's like
different so here's the thing when
you're in like Western Europe if you're
from Western Europe or even America like
all these countries you go to and you're
just like yeah this is like normal you
know but if you go further than those
countries and go into different
continents and some of these places have
completely different cultures and you
should respect those cultures that's
what my advice would be because it's
weird like hearing to buy for example
you can beat this well I don't I don't
come on this here and read the rules but
like you're not really allowed to show
public display of affection so like
holding hands or kissing and in like
some of the malls and stuff it's it's
become very touristy that that's not
really like in play if you walk down the
street and stuff it's like they don't do
that here so it's from coming from
something we used to into this world
it's kinda like oh that's different and
it feels a bit weird but it's also like
you're in their country so
you know respect that respect it yo
what's my new year's resolution or bra
um to cook more to cook more as my new
year's resolution because I'm quite well
you know if you guys watch master I'm
I'm pretty good at cooking like I'm okay
um but i just don't really do it so I'm
not vegan no never been a week I love
like a lot of my YouTube friends think
that I am vegan all used to be vegan I
was never vegan um so I don't know why
thought that just healthy and into gym
will you bring out an exercise video
here's the thing I've thought about
doing them but I just don't know how
many people would be interested in the
same as the food stuff like if you guys
want to know how much I'm meeting on
what I eat and stuff like that like I
can obviously talk about it but I just
don't know how if it's even interesting
you only kale the thing is I don't
actually even eat that much kale like I
dukale add kale and cheese get back to
the other dash hey boom do dahm do dahm
do dahm do dahm Joe's already beat you
on that cooking mm-hmm was Jeremiah chef
though was he no he wasn't there sorry
also I probably will not with this
filter on but I probably look really
tired because i said i woke up at 4am
everyone's always like prank call
someone I can't cuz I'm on my phone I
cannot do anything this is what I'm
broadcasting on oh yeah and what's he
gonna say yet also if you're wondering
why I've like lack of snapchats and
stuff like that is because I've been so
busy filming so basically I'm trying to
make another travel video you you know
you went on to Mykonos and I made that
travel video and that's honestly that
one of my favorite things to make so
making another video like that so any
time I've been filming it's been for
that so if you're being wonderin where
me weird snapchats have been watched
your snapchat Marcus Butler i am marcus
butler on everything ping my phone looks

see it again this is it you can have 10
marks points for anyone that guesses it

gonna and I didn't reply yeah um a
little comments are now just smelly gym
hat swim with sharks can you do that in
