hello beautiful sexy people welcome to
video where it's gonna be a quiz there's
a lot of fake news about like news is a
bit like YouTube where news like to use
click bait but it's often art worse than
you too because the news media like to
lie and just chat basically so
we're gonna test our fake news detector
on this quiz so when you guys play along
with me okay to model Adriana Lima said
it's flattering knowing men desire me
for them I remember a man who would also
have sex with a McChicken so don't let
it get to my head like the first bit
it's flattering knowing men desire her
like I can imagine her saying that but
then I remember a man would also have
sex with a chicken that's gotta be fake
yes okay so it was actually the other
way around like a man actually did have
sex with him a chicken is real okay
whatever tickles your fancy
Muslims want to ban the kids cartoon
pepper pigs
if it is real it's a bit of a
generalized generalization right I can't
be real fake widely quoted in the folk
story said today it's the first time I
came to know of the program no matter if
I was ice on a roll time got in on the
subnormal subliminal messaging game by
giving Donald Trump horns and putting
him in a similar pose to Hitler's while
naming him personal beer it's crazy
isn't it seeing those two people next to
each other is a little bit scarier than
that
whereas horns I gained by giving Donald
Trump horns I still I can't see the
horns
I'm gonna say real though Oh fake the
Hitler cover is from eight points four
which is an issue in which he was named
Person the year a school has been
handing out Donuts with Muslim writing
on it why why is that like it why is
that news if it I think that's very real
is everything just fake the writing is
actually a tribute to Lord of the Rings
it's all Kish for one ring to rule them
all one ring to find them one ring to
bring them
so was that was that language actually
created for Lord of the Rings then is
that what that's saying if that was us a
lot of effort Pope Francis
Publishing harmful stories or leaking
documents is a sin in his eyes that's
gotta be real hey we got one right
a-and it's real first real one Pope had
a lot to say about fake news adding that
if the unseen information already the
part and spreading it is a sin and it's
harmful with your Mountain Pope spread
positivity people share the love and
smile Denzel Washington says mainstream
media spreads real yeah you
like a lot of people speak out that's
I've spoke out about this like don't get
me wrong there is some important great
news out there but there's just a lot of
 like a lot of it and it's just
frustrating because when you read
something from these huge companies
posting like you can only read a
headline and then that is what people
assume with what the subject is they're
talking about like they don't just when
they've seen my headline when they're
out in the streets if they see hear
someone else talking about they'll go oh
yeah yeah yeah I've read that too and
it's like everyone's just sharing
 basically like essentially at
the end of the day like yeah that's
what's frustrating about it an airplane
