Robert Ulrich was jet skiing I've known
before to raise awareness for the
homeless he felt his death when his
parachute fell to open that is very like
deep video I feel but I just like to
leave it on this note at the end which
I've just read which i think is very
true so I'm going to read it to you
which is if you take anything away from
these photos it should be the knowledge
that while death is certain its timing
is not it's become a cliche these days
but that doesn't make it any less true
always live your life to the fullest
death will come no matter what you do if
we all end up the same in the end
then it's the journey that matters not
the destination is very true like I do
you know death scares the shit out of me
but it's going to happen to every
everyone at some point go and live your
life to the fullest
yeah whoo brofist BAM not like PewDiePie
just you know
well then feel weird taking hope you
like the video but yeah
okay I'll see you tomorrow goodbye
