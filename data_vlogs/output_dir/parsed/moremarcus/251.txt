beautiful place is stunning we're
basically at a resort I'm still here at
Virgin holidays I said they put on an
amazing incredible trip and we're at the
Six Senses resort now we're basically
private island and it's its own hotel
resort and it's a jungle it is just
incredible so I thought today I couldn't
not vlog because I want to show you guys

a little tour because they've given us
this honeymoon pad which is like a
obviously it's made for honeymoons and
you know you can take whoever here but I
need a Shoji because we've just done
some photos in it but it is just
ridiculous so first of all you have your
own little walkway so like I said we are
literally in a jungle pretty much um the
hotel resorts over there but you've got
your own walkway starts up there and
come down here and then walking around
here continues I when I ran up here by
the way I shat it because it B just flew
into my into my face and then you guys
know what would be the most so stepping
down mm-hmm
come to this little walkway and then
BOOM look at that you're like okay cool

some more stairs some beds etc come back
up here in this first room is what they
called the living area so wait for it to
look at imagine having breakfast there

heaven and you got toilet in here I did
use the toilet yeah for a week and it
was very very warm in that toilet
because there wasn't an aircon an aircon
anyone you got a shower here

this up here this goes into the bedroom
so we could turn the aircon on in here

loads of outfits I'll show you I'm
wearing outfits in this Sun it's very
hot so you can probably see that I am
sweating this is the aircon room /
bedroom oh and here is it's a little bit
messy just because that's my outfit

insane and of course you've still got
the glorious view going on here and
you've got balcony it goes all the way
around the outside which I'll show you

boom straight out onto the other side
and you can see why it's called The Rock
Villa con you because it's very rocky
and you walk down here boom that balcony
goes all the way along madness isn't it
I quite honestly don't think I've ever
witnessed a greater room than this
