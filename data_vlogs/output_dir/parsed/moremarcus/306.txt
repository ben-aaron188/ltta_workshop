island so the third thing would be
another person to share that experience
with me you guys are sending too many
snapchats hey Marcus I have a question

service
hi Marcus um have you got any tips for
making it a successful YouTube channel
love you lot
any tips to start a successful channel
do something that you want to do don't
try and make something just because
you've seen it be popular or be done
before make something that you're happy
making and stick to it and if you're
gonna do it you have to see it for a
long time well you all remember as most
of the big channels we're doing it for
years before they got like any size at
all so stick with it hi Marcus some
original why is your favorite month and

hi Marcus how are you my question is
would you rather go skydiving or would
you rather go bungee jumping
I'd rather chill with your lizard I've
done both and honestly skydiving because
bungee jumping is too realistic to but
it terrifies you because you're so close
to the ground where skydiving such a
surreal experience that you don't it
doesn't really feel real and it's just
like an amazing feeling song from scenes
