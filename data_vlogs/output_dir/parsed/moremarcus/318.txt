apologize for pushing Brennan towards
you to begin a new relationship I didn't

BYE MOM bye
now I hope that someone said something
to Brendan and I refuse that someone to
be me deal with you at all problems
yourself just go Brenda mate I've got a
boyfriend
nothing could have prepared me for this
day today is the day when I have the
ability to see the one and only Marcus
Butler I arrive at the airport awaiting
Marcus's arrival I've missed him so much
I saw a plane from the window landing
knowing it was Marcus's and I jumped out
of my seat is this girl like a plane
watcher Jersey do you know how many
planes land an airport and Heathrow like
it's one every 30 seconds leaves and
takes off she that's definitely the
Boeing a three four seven eight nine I
saw the first few passages exit the
plane and I rush towards the gate exit a
grin overcoming me I'm sorry you go to
the arrivals to pick someone up from an
international airport you don't see him
get off the plane you just don't a
traveler I know I immediately know it's
my six-foot tall boyfriend walking
hurriedly looking up and recognizing me
down I'm six at one I don't talk about
yourself come on
he walked up to me and hooked me pulling
me close to him in which I hugged him
tightly back feeling protected in his
arms
I know for a fact nobody said anything
to Brendan and after the stunt he pulled
I can tell he's not letting up I drove
to my apartment if marks as happy as can
be marks my jam to the radiator
screaming the lyrics having people look
at us from other cars we stop by
Starbucks for coffee on the way and it's
obviously no place to be yes it is the
place to be
afterwards we arrive to my apartment I
saw one of the strangest sights it was a
bouquet of plastic flowers on my front
door with a card marks looked at me and
I could feel him stiffened beside me
stiffened like he's got a hard-on or
stiffen who's back from I side with
frustration I picked up the card and
read it with mark it's reading over my
shoulder ally I give you these flowers
to represent our love please give me
another chance you won't regret it
Brendon who's Brendon I never would want
my relationship marks to be brewing
because a Brendon what an asshole
Brendon is my ex-boyfriend I glared at
the flowers and picked night before Sun
locked my apartment door I'm walking in
quickly
Oh Lu what was your ex boyfriend soon a
new flowers open my window by the garage
pars on the edge of the building so I
can make an accurate shop before mark 16
he else I said Marcus these flowers
definitely symbolize my love with
Brendan I picked up the red plastic
flowers tossed them out the window to
add to the collecting garbage fake what
a joker I explained the entire story to
Marcos him remaining quiet the whole
time came a bit emotional at the
apartment I told him why I wasn't
planning on telling him I knew I
wouldn't be able to tell me anything I
understand you didn't want to thank you
Marcus
and don't curiosity runs next time you
plan on seeing this Brendon guy never I
wanted to meet him shake his hand
but everything was okay shake his hand
hey mister steal yo girl how's it going
buddy
smile be best mates you know the whole
bit are you alright mate the face of
someone shitting themselves is literally
one of the funniest things I will ever
see in my entire life you know you're
not that strong
you're not that hard I'm glad that made
you happy I hate how simple I am
that same night marks and I headed out
to my family's home for dinner there
marks is one of the most competent guys
I know I could tell he's a bit nervous
when we pulled up to my house Mark's
didn't immediately open his car door
your I asked yo just fine he said I can
tell you're nervous Marcus he looked at
me of a cheeky grin and why really that
easy to read uh-huh top balance between
you two seriously I'm home everyone no
response
mark smile up stranger each other
everyone's cars were here who was there
other than the only infamous
ex-boyfriend
Brendan her mom's a bitch Brendan just
fuck off
mark had sent me stiffened she's
deafening now and before anyone could
say in here like tell him I figured out
who he was what are you doing here I'm
Brendan I wish I assume you're a friend
of Alison's Marcus snickered Oh Maddie's
boyfriend actually boyfriend boyfriend
that's nice
how long have you two been going out for
and asked I couldn't help but notice his
eyes wander down to Marcus his arm
clearly strong muscles now underneath
his tough skin
we've been doing since December
I guess Ali wasn't on I get a game a lot
while there then what are you talking
about I asked bit today well we both
know that you don't work well while
distracted and obviously a new boyfriend
is quite distracting Brendon why are you
here
stop you grab my hand this time leading
out the door and walking to the car I
hear the door slam behind us and I
turned to see Brendon Alison I just want
you to know that your behavior is
atrocious and you think you can win me
back through jealousy then you are
looking at the wrong guy he stopped
talking after Marcus punished Brendon
straight in the jaw this time I could
read marks perfectly Brendon shut up go
home and leave Ali alone she's been done
with you for a long time and we're
together now I asked why he did that
because you're mine I was always yours I
love you Marcus I love you too Ally
after the incident the other day my
family and my family marks and I decided
it would be best if you went out to
dinner marks and I agreed that the night
was a success for me we could see
obvious approving glances from my mother
and father at dinner at a few hours left
until Marcus's flight back to England
beau decided to take him someone who'd
probably appreciate I took him to my
roof that's it and we arrived at the top
he smiled widely without saying anything
I couldn't help but become teary-eyed as
we held on to each other him giving me a
confused look in him asking what's wrong
it's nothing oddly please let me be the
therapist for once it's just that I
haven't been so happy ever it's all
falling into place all that's at least
how it seems everything about you is
what I ever looked for in a girl funny
show Maud is beautiful and finally know
someone whose cheeks get nearly as red
as mine that's actually that's funny
though red cheeks right now haha I
replied good we've been through so much
together happy Marcus I love you more
than anyone else no one else understands
me as much as you do you're making me
sound like an angel well to me you are
oh my god oh my god then to me your
fondue fondue hat yes because everybody
loves fondue
I love you Ali I love you too Marcus
through it all marked a knife stuck
together everything after I graduated
from Boston uni I moved back to London
where I stayed in an apartment or should
I say flat and I had a job as a
counseling psychiatrist about two years
ago so marks proposed to me indeed on a
rooftop and then a year ago is when we
actually sealed the deal as the years
have passed and I thought about more and
more I don't think it was fate per se
but I don't think it was random
coincidence either driven myself close
to insanity thinking about this madness
so that's why I decided to classify our
relationship as were boys together what
made us find each other that word right
there
insanity the end anyway that rounds up
