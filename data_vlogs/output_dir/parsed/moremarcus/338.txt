hello welcome to a video that could be
quite funny have no idea how it's gonna
turn out but I've got a book that is
called tinder nightmares now if you're
not aware of what tinder is tinder is a
dating app the dating app where you can
meet you the girls or guys on there you
swipe to find the person who you like
and if you like them you swipe right if
you don't like them you swipe left and
then conversations can begin this book
is full of tinder nightmares
aka probably funny conversations so I
thought it'd be funny to just read some
out Bayesian talk about the scenarios
this book is about those shitty mishap
weird little puzzle pieces along the way
how'd you meet a person how do you get
to know them quickly well an easy way is
to ask them a wildly inappropriate
question and see if they fall in love
you but chances are they'll just end up
laughing at you if they're friends this
is the thing right so a lot of my
friends on tinder think that the best
way to open is you have to like have
this really witty message that captures
somebody with your creativity and they
literally spend like hours thinking of
what to say when I'm like won't you just
be like yo what's up or hey how's it
going Oh God from Malcolm are you my
appendix because I don't understand how
you work but this feeling in my stomach
makes me want to take you out pose a
girl reading that I just be a bit like
what what are you a campfire cuz you're
hot and I want small you must be a small
amount of red phosphorus and I must be a
tiny stick because we're a match I like
I actually quite like that it's quite
funny favorite non pornographic magazine
to masturbate to
insert witty pick-up line in hopes of
getting a response someone replies and
this is a week later
try harder I'd rock you like a 40 year
old dad rocks a fanny pack at Disneyland
the response that's pretty hard I like
that that would put me off instantly
because when I think of a 40 old man
wearing fanny pack at Disney on I think
of them being a little bit creepy and
weird looking this is really bad this is
this is from Katie are you from
Starbucks because I like you a latte
that's really bad don't ever don't use
that one guys knock knock who's there
Dewey do you do you have to wear a
condom at least
at least getting straight to the point
you know Aaron is getting right to the
point on that one probably not best to
tackle it with that you should probably
be be advising to wear a condom if
you're gonna partake in that Titanic oh
shit that's a terrible icebreaker good
bear response ha ha ha good one bear
response
well thank you some people are so like
but that's funny that is that's quite
funny they're just I hurt good one break
chat be interested in a minute and a
half of mediocre sex with the lights on
I'll take you to McDonald's and split
the check to prove I'm no weirdo
you couldn't sound more like a weirdo in
the space of 30 seconds if you tried oh
that I'm not gonna read this a bit too

I might cry off right beside you they're
all from guys as well every opener is
from a guy over then one so far Patrick

night back to me will make your whole ah
