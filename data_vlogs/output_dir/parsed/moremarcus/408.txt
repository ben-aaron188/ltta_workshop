journey that I very much so enjoyed with

and we called it Harvey
I hear talking at the end of my hospital
bed I slowly open my heavy eyes to see
Marcus of course
Zoe Alfea and Harvey Reginald in
Starbucks Oh Oh you feeling good I need
to drink though please he's so gorgeous
hon your little man Zoe smiled as she
gently put Harvey back to his cot marks
came back in with a cup of water that he
handed me doctor said you can go home
today as long as you feel okay
after the hospital discharged me and
Harvey Marcus drives us back home good
job we built up Harvey's room before all
the others I decided to take a warm bath
as Marcus bedded down Harvey ha ha me
and Marcus were cuddled up on the sofa
me on his lap bull you know I love you
so much Lola I always will and Dada -
Harvey I fell asleep in Marcus's arms
feeling the safest and happiest I've
ever felt I love you both - four years

bride Oh Marcus smiles at me mouthing
the words I love you before leaning in
and smashing our lips together they

first ever fanfiction I know it's rushed
but it's my first and I tried I have
made other fan fictions if you want to
check them out but if not thank you for
all the support out of this 2015 update
just a hello to Marcus for reading this
to be honest so you have to see how
cringe my younger self was and that this
is the least dirty fanfic you could have
chosen but nevertheless I'm lucky that
my must choose ins so thank you if you
don't already know Mark's uploaded a
video thanks to a viewer telling me and
bacey Mark's is reading this story first
of all would like to say how much I want
to cool hunter rock and stay there but I
just want to add this chap to inform you
that I don't know what I was thinking
when I wrote this like two years back
now maybe you can laugh as much as I did
thanks everyone for support though
everyone is so nice on here well yeah
that's the first fanfiction complete
I've never read a complete fanfiction I
had so much fun doing it do you feel
kind of sad that the journeys now done
that that is it positive is finished but
hey this is the end of a chapter but
this could also be start of a new era
maybe we should make this into seasons
we've done season one that's it finished
would you like to see this and this
format carried out if it is to do with
me I think it's funnier so if you guys
know of any dirty fanfiction or
something like that then tell me what to
read in the comment section below also
should probably add in a thank you to
the girl who wrote in the first place
because you've given great entertainment
to me and everyone else so thank you fan
