much energy because I've just got off a
plane from Florida so I'm very very
jet-lagged but I am looking absolutely
delightfully dapper what word

because I'm working with varied okay to
UK today and I'm going over to the X
Factor's house where all the contestants
are and I'm taking a whole load of
packages from very dope coated UK with
loads of clothes and stuff and I'm
