good morning from well not as sunny as I
was hoping la but don't worry because
I'm going to change that because I'm in
a nice bright top which means I'm gonna
bring the Sun to LA but I have something
really really exciting which is why
blogging and I'm going to be bringing
you guys along with me I'm going to tell
you an intro now but then you're going
to find out about it but it's basically
in collaboration with Malibu and they're
pranking an office today
so Jen you're ruining the vibes of
summer and I'm going to be behind the
scenes of a very big prank that they're
putting on all the people that work in
the office and I haven't seen it yet but
I think what they're doing is attaching
a slide like a slide out of an office
window like their boss's office all the
way down into a Malibu theme party and
it's going to be amazing but the people
who are going to be going down the
slides I have no idea this is happening
I think they they're going into their
office today as it's a normal day and I
think that they're meeting with their
boss some kind of like review on on how
they've been doing in their job but
instead they can be asked to like get it
wild and go crazy by going down a slide
and enjoying your life because summer
yeah we're going to be going with my
nice orange top brings summer along with
me so we're now walking along from Santa
Monica to Venice we decided to walk
because we have some time whilst
everything's being set up and ready what
everyone's going to get prepped

breakthrough that's what it is right now
