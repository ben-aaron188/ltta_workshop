with the car like I'm leaving you
Merry Christmas you too I miss you and
love you too Oh have a lovely day lovely
day have a lovely Christmas I'm running
might have a bar because I feel so weird
today
I've got like a really bad headache and
I just feel quite like math I think it's
just because I'm tired I'm not really
sure I think a bath might help this is
perfect every day right what should I
put in
um what is that
we don't know but it smells delicious
I think maybe this one northern light
and then some Christmasy bubbles
mm-maybe are you I love my lava although
the body shop spice apples
smelled incredible I don't know where
that is yeah look at my shower gel draw
this is getting out of hand
oh my god this is the one that I took on
holiday to Mykonos that smells of summer
little zoella shower glazed gingerbread
scented
oh I haven't tried these yet shower
jellies this smells amazing snowflakes
from Kashmir by Bath & Body Works it's
just essentially a lot of our fan body
what body works ones and some body shop
ones but yeah this smells so incredible
I don't know ever showing you this
before but this is how I organize my
like skincare I guess mostly like shower
bath and skin care stuff considering how
often I use fake tan of audio oils I'm
not too sure why I have a whole drawer
of it because I don't really use it that
much in reality I want to I just don't
seem to do it because I never want my
white bedsheets to get fake tan on them
um hair mask store why do animals know
what's in here grab any scrubs
scrubs and oils no okay I'll take this
but then we've also got this one just
inkay oh oh I'll tell you what I do want
to do though I want to do a face mask oh
my god this isn't just face mask this is
also moisturizers and I'm quite aware
that no normal human being has this many
skin care items but because of the
nature of what I do very lucky in the
sense I get sent quite a lot and this is
after I've decluttered so I think maybe
another decluttering session is in order
I keep things that I think oh I'll try
that and then obviously the more and
more things you get that you think oh
I'll try that you put them in the drawer
you go to open the drawer and you're
like a lot of things to try and no time
to try them so I do need to have another
clear out
drink up intensive that's overnight I
don't know which one I want to do well
there's a heavy duty chloroplast also
good in okay I'm going to go for this
one
the Perricone MD chloroplast my masks
fab hello everybody it's many hours
later um today has been an ultimate fail
I had the worst migraine rush headache
all day and have just been in bed it's
now 5:00 p.m. so if still have the
evening I still have a really bad
headache oh I'm not sure those flashing
lights probably help um but I'm gonna

that because I have already watched that
so much holiday classic Fred Claus I've
also watched this a fair amount so far
