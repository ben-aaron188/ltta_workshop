good morning everybody I thought we'd
vlog today because I feel like there's a
lot going on and you're gonna want to
see it maybe mark is coming around
popping Shana coming around and we're
doing like a little Halloween night in
thing I do this every year because we're
adults now we can't celebrate Halloween
like we used to we can't go
trick-or-treating I mean I think some
people probably push their luck and try
it but yeah we're too old for that now
and we like to go to the scare park
which is always fun but I also like to
do something because I love watching
scary films and there's no better way to
do that than to get your friends around
and to just have like a cozy kind of
Halloween themed night in which is what
we're doing tonight however one small
difference is that this year I'm friends
with Marc and he also shares my love of
all things Halloween and his birthday is
on the 18th of October which I know is
still like five six days away but we
wanted to celebrate it tonight so we're
kind of having like a birthday slash
Halloween themed night and I'm gonna
film oh no oh my god that literally made
me crap myself so we're gonna film a
video for my main channel which is us
like setting up and decorating and like
all the little bits and bobs just
because I know you guys really like the
picnic party video that I did so I
thought this could be something quite
similar in that aspect and I just
thought it'd be nice for you to see it

amber oh hello hello we just had the
morning from hell it's all gone wrong
but we've survived basically there's a
lot of traffic there's an accident which
is really sad and I hope everyone's okay
although I did see the car and it
literally did you see it was just a bump
a bump and multiple roads have been
closed so everyone is using our road to
get to the main road so it took us like
ten minutes to pull out and there's this
poor girl in this car who just did I
don't know she's just she was just
having a bit of a breakdown and she
couldn't move her car like back enough
for me to get out and she was like you
can come now and I was like I mean I can
try I know I've got a mini but it's
still a car so re I could see it in my
wing mirror the front of her car and the
back of Mike's I was trying to get round
her there was no gap like like the
sensor got fog on I was like a Larry I
was like I think I we've touched cause I
get the cars like brush a brushed every
ever so slightly I was like could you
move fucking she was like I'm too scared
I'm gonna roll forward and I was like
it's okay don't worry I was being really
nice I should imagine a lot of people in
that situation would not have known I
was good not maybe you need to move a
car but looking at it like I'm not sure
about this is carburizing it slightly I
was like hi and I'm driving your car
today a car behind it was like I like
revving forward as well like he wasn't
like he was being me and patient her as
well oh it's just one of my situations
where everyone just gets a bit stressed
yeah
like driving it's stressful sometimes
you gotta be careful you gotta have eyes
in the back your head but how I got out
of my driveway I have no I honestly
without scratching my car I don't know
because she couldn't move and I was like
I got owned literally there must have
been literally a millimeter in it at one
point I did actually think she bumped my
car was like hold on I think it just I
think she just did it but they should
have had to be fair yeah obviously some
something's on our side today mark yay
we're heading into town we're going to
go to boots I need to grab a few bits

an outfit today well we didn't get to do
the modeling thing with this hi oh we
want to look okay has anyone seen this
is it gay or is it a video well it's up
to video yeah of a guy doing like 20
poses in like five seconds our
photoshoot is I feel like I have not
burned in my blood show very well it's
like the funniest thing ever Mia might
want to learn it so whenever we have to
take a picture we should just do it it's
like this isn't it it's like he has all
these moves that he just like whips out
and it's like a flash a second yeah it's
like crazy anyway heading to boot whoo
whoo whoo they were in boots now oh I
look so tired and I was going to tell
you is that the bag beyond my travel bag
is currently the start gift in boots for
one week starting today ending next
Friday and it is 26 pounds instead of 50
so if you wanted the bat mock clapping
in the background it's a bargain let me
tell you that much for 26 pounds you are
getting quite a lot because I know how
much went into getting these made so
here we are here is mark modeling the
bag and if any of you weren't sure this
is what you get inside it so you get the
mug which is topped with cream and
sprinkles you get the pencils and you
get the keyring and this is the normal
price but for one week it is 26 pounds
so yes and I judging by what the manager
here is just said I would be quick
because she said the doors open this
morning and people have already bought
them
so yeah if you see it in boots and
they're running and ponderosas well and
they don't just find one they're buying
quite a few yeah yeah that's very
exciting I'm so happy to be able to
share that with you please tweet me if
