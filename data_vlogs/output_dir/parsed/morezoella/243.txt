good morning everybody I kind of logged
the process of getting face ready and
hair ID today so I will insert a clip
now of all of the stages sped up really
fast so I look like a Sims character
I somehow lost I was doing my hair and
makeup you probably won't be able to
actually tell but I somehow got on to
gender reveals and then I got on to like
announcing were pregnant and then I got
on to like finding out I'm pregnant like
all these different like videos you know
how it has like autoplay so it just
carries on going and I ended up like
watching all these people who I've never
met
telling their families and their friends
that they're pregnant and then doing
gender reveals and all the creative ways
that they found out the gender of their
baby I'm like probably like smiling away
like just so cute I just love everything
that's on YouTube it was YouTube's 10
year anniversary yesterday I think and I
just think that's crazy like YouTube has
been a thing for ten years and I've been
making videos since 2009 so a good six
years of it and which is so cool um so
yeah I just think YouTube's amazing you
can find honestly anything and
everything on YouTube and that just goes
to show you can get sucked into a black
hole and then you can take a really long
time to try get out of it whether that's
kind of like talking dogs or cats that
fall down holes or women another thing
they're pregnant to the world I just
think is it's amazing it's so cool and
I'm so glad I'm on it
now look who's come back it alfie deyes
or is it what the hell he got he decided
to get all his hair chopped off oh it's
just like it takes so long I'm trying to
cut my sound me basically check my hair
how I wanted it I would have had to
leave it for another probably eight
months and I was already wearing a
beanie every day for the last like three
months so I'm just I don't want to be
wearing a beanie for another eight
months every day because my head just
doesn't look good so I just got it it's
