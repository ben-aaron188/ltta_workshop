oh hey Cass I don't know if it's focused
Alfie hi everyone hi everyone so I
watched a vlog today because I feel like
today is quite a big day in zoella
history as you know I have long hair
ombre hair and I've had this for a
really long time I think it was the end
of 2011 that I got on braid possibly
that's a long time for you very long
four years the same thing every day and
it got to the point where all I was
doing was throwing up in a ponytail or a
high bun like you would have seen in a
lot of vlogs a lot of videos it's shoved
up and I just I kind of grew to just
hate it having long hair has its ups and
has its downs drying it takes nine hours
I have to start like an hour and a half
like in advance if I want to do anything
to it like properly like I want to curl
it or something and it just got to the
point where my life got busier I got a
puppy for one that takes up a lot of
time I just never had time to do my hair
and I always just scraped up and I just
grew to hate it not my not all my hair
just the length of it the time it took
and actually wearing the same outfit
every day oh yeah repetitive well for
four years as well it all breaks away
hence why the end is so look at that
it's like one of those things you know
what menus and they go like that on
their shave they're even so today I'm
getting my hair cut
now I've toyed with the idea on and off
for six months my probably like six to
eight months between your hand
Lauren hair it can actually make you
look a bit drowned out right a bit
drowned by hair like sometimes I think I
look like that woman off the ring you
know the one that's dead that crawls out
the well I do go a bit prone over like
that and I just wanted to change 2015 is
the year for change and I'm gonna make
that change today and I gotta cut my
hair I gotta cut it you're not gonna cut
it
I've got to say I'm really excited I
keep getting excited butterflies I'm
also
really nervous because what if I hate it
I don't think you will I feel like I've
thought about it so much but I can't
hate it yeah you've got so much hair but
if you didn't like it you could cut it
into another soil that you could like
like you could just keep on working with
that also I guess for girls if I really
hate it I could just get extensions if I
went too short though I want to know no
stop worrying yourself okay I like it
okay let's do this come you ready you
ready for this change I'm gonna look
like a whore know a woman feels like why
have you done your hair to go to a
hairdressers yeah I've wanted to do the
last long plat but I'm ever gonna do for
a while
can you have to get outside a helicopter
it okay let's go I don't know if you've
noticed but I got a new camera I'll be
good at what I did and I did the
quality's better but you let me know you
know I might as I wear a crop top today
I thought wearing high-waisted jeans
dress on yeah let's go look at that it
looks so pretty
Irene want to go in like I say it looks
because anyway job
look how long it is right this is before
and after it looks oh no
like literally like a ruinous 12 inches
yeah it's gotta be like 30 inches yeah
it kind of comes above we decided to not
go so short because I thought that would
have been Gary but we've taken off
literally how much reckon half man I
think it looks so much better it feels
so much healthier thanks so much to food
so it just feels so weird like it's not
like all the way down here and 50 here I
can I can see myself wanting to keep
going yeah now we are in gbk and Alfredo
and we're gonna get some burgers I love
you Kate burgers it's so
yeah yeah yeah for hair
it's just with your hair with so long I
know I just don't know why I didn't do
this sooner when I was in Paris just
like there wasn't one part we didn't
I did text my mom they're like hugging
my head she was like foods arrived look
at that what have you got chicken burger
with bacon and cheeky bit I've come for
the classic fat these chicks the one
aren't they I'm gonna be healthy but
you're always trying to be healthy
they're so skinny I mean visually that's
not even like one calorie is
that I bet that calories this is like
the best if garlic man
so good although you are gonna taste
garlicky for like three days for you I
know it says your hairs become off
you're growing taller in there enough is
like maybe a little you are say you're
going taller we're just gonna pop into
all of the bonus and oh my favorite
shots because I dunno oh yeah I got you
a present
earlier did you don't poop I
since I've been a dog oh I just always
have dr. mark in every coat pocket I
think if you have a dog you'll totally
relate there and then we're going to
head back to knowledge they don't and
they don't doesn't pose
it's so cold oh my goodness
forgot a rhubarb and custard sweet in my
mouth I just took one from posh totty
the little shopping Brighton because my
breath stops so garlicky high-quality
systolic
um all these pings a ticket here he
comes look at him
start nerd stuff oh yeah look at him go
the underground carpark
catwalk here is Alfie deyes
it's gonna fall down on Charleston moody
at you and then I look to my right knows
I'm except in your girl sitting in the
car smiling at me
how's that oh maybe not that's why you
do those things on impulse what it land
I'm never gonna plan a Muni lavon's you
won't what do you mean why just hope
Phil you drive it
hey hey hello are you panicked my hair
oh you in a bit of a mischievous mood
let's chew this mood look a little Percy
I went into Oliver bonus and I bought a
few little bits and pieces so I just
thought I would share them with you this
is a little nibbles dish so you put
either two types of nibbles or crisps
and a dip and it's actually metal
cleaning and it has a bit of copper in
it if any of you've seen my most recent
haul video you will know I have a slight
obsession with copper right now so
Oliver bonus kind of supplying me with
my copper habit I also got this which
I'm gonna put either on my dressing
table or I'm gonna put next to my beds
where I take off like rings bracelets
earrings watch or memory cards and
things that I have in the daytime so I
really like that what she's lost
something on under this what are you
doing
so that's cute and the last thing is
this big proper metal bars I don't have
any visors like this where you can
literally just put like a few single
flowers in there so I thought that was
really really nice and again I feel like
this is something that could go on my
dressing table that's definitely not
annoying when I'm vlogging so yeah those
were my three copper purchases I just
got this in my PA box because I've been
going through all my peer box stuff
today and look I'm on the front cover of
the top of the pops magazine and this is
the article inside there's Percy in this
Pippin and it's just like an a to Zed of
me
basically oh is for one direction in
other things delivered to my Pierre box
I got black scented toilet roll not sure
how I feel about this I mean crazy
concept smells really good though
although sniffing toilet paper seems a
little odd this is lit just like old
times guys the
time zowie starts vlogging again she
falls asleep and forgets to end our vlog
so I'm going to end it for her
thank you for watching guys if you
enjoyed it give it a thumbs up and she
will see you sometime soon
good morning tis I I completely forgot
to end my vlog yesterday so I think
Alfie ended it for me I'm gonna put two
days into what I think because I'm gonna
film today as well just have some lunch
Nola's looking at the guinea pigs right
now I think she's quite confused by them
I think she I think she knows they're
not toys but she's not quite sure what
they are because when I'm playing with
the guinea pig she gets really jealous
which i think is the one time she
realizes they're actual creatures she's
licking my feet but besides that she
just kind of watches them and she's like
a toy and then it'll move as you wait I
don't think that's a toy but it's quite
funny to watch their their relationships
building and Nala discovering what the
guinea pigs are the guinea pigs are not
fast by Nala in the slightest well
though
Pippin who's normally the shyest of the
guinea pigs Persis like he loves humans
you can pick Percy up and give him a
cuddle in a fall asleep on you Pippins a
lot more like leave me in my cage don't
touch me
and he is actually showing way more
interest in Nala at van Persie this
probably isn't interesting but I find it
interesting because they're all my my
little beings so I haven't really daily
vlog too much on this channel I think
it's interesting for sure when you
document your life whether that's daily
or weekly or whenever you want me I
think it's always really interesting not
just for you guys if it is interesting I
don't even really know for my family and
also for me to watch back and remember
all these insane moments so I do want to
start up again I don't know
I'm gonna do I'm definitely not gonna do
daily because if I set myself that
challenge I will fail and I'll feel like
I'm failing you and letting you down and
that's I think one of the reasons I get
most stressed out about it because I'm
like no no log they would have like I
need to do a vlog so I think I'm just
gonna smog when I feel like it and if
that's every single day of the week then
call its that's three days bundled into
one then call basically just don't have
really high expectations of me on this
channel and I just want to enjoy it and
upload when I want what I want I can't
say that every day will be really
exciting but for me I love watching the
vlogs where like people are at home
chilling like seeing what people bought
Waitrose I don't know is that your con
is there something in it that you're
trying to get out it keeps them
entertained for hours if only they made
these four alfea's there's alfredo come
in to get Sean a birthday cake and for
this it was just birthday yesterday
it seemed until Friday we're all going
out for a nice meal Alfie's causing high
desert harvick havoc in lakeland yes you
are dropping everything I like the look
of fist a lot look it's a pinata cake so
you make the cake and then you fill it
what you want
Oh sir I don't think it's made like this
on tumblr I think this is like they've
tried to make it like a quick a quick
way of doing it but I don't know cookie
cups hot see I just didn't ever know any
of this existed this is like my favorite
section in Lakeland the coke look at
this little YouTube section there's
roots there's mine there's some and
Nicks and there's tons just let you guys
know as well I don't know if you've
actually seen I've released a new makeup
bag and it's this one I actually think
this is my favorite of the three
although that coming order now I do like
them all but this one says just say yes
and it's in like a baby pink with like
little gold thingies so right there if
you want it and I use mine prove all of
it because I've made it you know
like I love me more than Kanye loves
Kanye I love you more than kim loves Kim
I love you more than Bieber that's Eva I
have no idea what to get out in for
Valentine's Day so no those kind of like
nan days that kind of just got invented
which might I mean didn't we actually
are you negate each other anything
all right no you said you're gonna say
five million pounds no I just I think a
card is nice

really hard to buy for and now we Sean's
birthday cake which we've got from
what's it called Julian eggs this milks

at all the macaroons haven't picked up
Sean a birthday cake I don't know what
you're on about that it's not a birthday
cake this is my life you're always five
paces behind Alfie because he walks so
I'm one step ahead as a game in life I
just can't keep up with him look it's
big long lanky legs just riding off into
the distance
like I can't keep up with him effort and
I always say Alfie slow down we're doing
how you're strolling I can smell illegal
substances and we're back from town and
up he's got out dinner with his friends
and just take another on a walk and now
I'm just sat watching Ciccone Jolie's
old videos on my TV and look Anna's got
long hair I don't think you can see look
