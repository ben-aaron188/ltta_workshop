good morning everybody it's the day of
me going home and going to my friend
baby shower so I have her present just
making like little piles by the door so
I don't forget anything because I am the
worst at remembering what to take with
me when I'm going somewhere I'm super
excited basically today is one of my
friends from school
Emma I have known her since I was 10 11
11 so that's a really really long time
and all my other old school friends and
my bet one of my best best friends she's
good Alex
I've known her since like we were in
nappies so I'm super excited to see
everybody it's gonna be so fun I just
can't believe she's having a baby like
it's so crazy
and so exciting and the guinea pigs are
munching away on their food bye boys you
gonna be good are you gonna be good
have I got more food for you Pippin look
at the little green mouths I don't have
more for you anyway the journey is gonna
take me around three and a half hours I
think it's about half 9:00 now no ten
probably ten so I need to get going
might stop off at a petrol station
because I do need petrol but I also want
some breakfast because I haven't had
time to grab any oh I need to pack
pajamas because I'm also staying back at
my old house which is also going to be
really weird guys I think what a bit OTT
on the road trip snacks
I've got fudge I've got 12 I've got
chicken caesar wrap I've got some tangy
from love these one of these all they
bring money and memory of the preschool
marches and a massive thing of water
which I'm gonna have to keep down there
freshers because I haven't had these in
years and I saw them I was like they
look good please probably sing on one
the long journey guys I got ki tamanna
here that's why I'm telling myself
anyway almost here
except I'm now stuck in traffic again
I've been stuck in traffic pretty much
this whole journey is now 2 o'clock and
I've been in my car since I was 10
that's a very long time Oh moving
forward basically I'm nearly there I
don't have the best memories of where I
am right now so it's making feel a bit
weird in my tummy you know when you just
have those places where bad things
happen and then you drive through them
again or you walk past them and it just
makes your tummy go ooh I feel like
right now some sort of vlogs
