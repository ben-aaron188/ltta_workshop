good morning everybody it's Saturday and
yesterday we did a kind of team selfie
which is lots of the people that we work
with both Alfie and myself and then
people that we jointly work with we did
like a huge kind of summer housewarming
like we appreciate you party
kind of similar to the one we did at
Christmas that time you might have seen
it in vlogmas and it was so much fun
like honestly it was just one of my
favorite days so far this year it was
Sports Day themed so we had things like
blindfolded wheelbarrow obstacle courses
and we had one team which was my team
and then we have one team which was
alphas team and we picked names out of a
hat so it was very mixed and like a
really good way of everyone kind of
coming together and kind of I don't know
it's just it was so nice this is the
like remnants this is after we've
cleared up this morning but we rented
another stretch tent we got a bigger one
of these when we had our friends and
family over for the housewarming but we
thought it would be nice to have a
smaller one because there wasn't as many
of us and we had a bar and we had like
sports day cocktails like themed
cocktails like one of the cocktails is
actually in a like sack like a sack race
cocktail it was amazing as a really fun
day and I haven't done things like that
since like honestly I think since I was
actually in school so I must have been
well I didn't really do sports day in
secondary school I'm not gonna lie our
tutor group was awful because none of us
wanted to do it there was always a very
like sporty tutor groups that would get
really involved in sports day and ours
just we never did in fact I think I did
a couple of Sprint's and that was it but
the last time I properly did sports day
I was probably like 10 11 so it's been a
very very long time but I think everyone
had an amazing day and it was a real
success we had somebody that cooked meal
for us so we had our dinner out here I
was like also this like cute little area
where we sat and had like canapes and
drinks Alfie and Sean got this fire pit
out last
but we didn't actually use it so we've
just got that there and this was the
board teams Alfie sport State Board and
on the other side you can see who won
team Alfie won a three-legged
egg-and-spoon we won the tights on the
head game I'm about that game was
amazing sack race Alfie's team won donut
hoopla Alf his team got 200 and we got
135 wheelbarrow race we won rounders
they smashed rounders like they lost
count of how many points they got which
really tipped them over the edge and
then we did a Southie quiz where alphas
team got 600 and mine team got 1200 so
in the end Alfie won and our team came
second but the quiz was so funny it was
all questions about like me and I'll
feel at how many times did I take my
driving test whose childhood teddy is
whose overall it was just one of the
best days and I really hope everyone had
a good time I think they did we went to
bed really late last night and then woke
up really early this morning because we
needed to clear the kitchen was an
absolute state like out here was an
absolute state so me and after you've
been like running around this morning
like headless chickens trying to tidy up
because this weekend we have Tania and
Jim coming to stay they haven't actually
properly stayed at this house yeah so
this is like their first time like
really experiencing the house I think
I'm really really excited to them to
come I've actually had a really bad
headache this morning I've just taken
some tablets so they should be arriving
in around 45 minutes and we are going to
go going to go we are going to go
pumpkin picking with tiny-g and poppy
and Shaun and I am so excited because we
went last year you may have seen my blog
post but we actually went too late
there was no pumpkins to pick it was
just all the ones that already been
picked and the season had kind of gone
so we managed to get a few little
squashes which actually they're my
favourite thing to get anyway but we
didn't manage to actually cut off any
giant like carving pumpkins so hopefully
when we go there's gonna be a few more
field I think I went a bit overboard on
the trees just slightly I got I got
carried away online shopping this isn't
all for like this weekend it's just for
us to like nibble on it it's just for
today but look they have all they're
like Halloweeny trees I did get some
festive friends but only because they're
delicious and some trees let's please
look so good white chocolate coated
biscuit balls YUM these are always
amazing gory and grizzly chocolate
pumpkins and then look they had these
goosed goose eggs so what some those
tourists shop to orange cause you can
never go wrong no no no goosed oh yeah
they're like um cream eggs but like
ghost eggs and then look at these
harrybo harrybo's scare mix I just got
carried away guys you know I get like
sour stripes I just like the sound of
those pumpkin patch cakes yes Maryland
cookie bites mini Cheddar's snowy
fingers and a little ginger some lunch
pudding because it just sounded really
good I'm just now trying to edit the
vlog from Alfie's birthday because I
completely forgot this week that I
needed to edit that so I was like I need
to do that today so I can put it up
later
oh yeah they do I'm so stylish
these are Alfie sliders I just put them
on so I could show them everything
outside pumpkin picking Tanya and Jim
coming to stay treats all this time we
were warty dick picking no it was all
the old Louis marrows and like squashes
like
yeah but I like the squashes I think
they're really autumnal we'll see what
we can get but we should probably take
do you have a little penknife or
anything
because to cut the pumpkins off you need
to take your own life
okay my ray-bans looks a lot like that
it's always the ones that you use and
love the most
yeah I find what we can do our food all
I need to real reapply I didn't bring my
sunglasses oh god you're screwed you're
gonna get us a watery eyes oh right I'm
so excited about this and we have like
the best weather for it yeah I'm screwed
bury me in it I think it's the one I
jump out to everyone I'm legit in a bush
I'm pumpkin Johnson Jim's pain pumpkin
drums but also Jim I think I found you

a vine no Tom's like did they grow in
the ground or on the ground they kind of
just sit there at half in half out
that's one thing on the cloud back so it
grows out and it just sits like on the
ground like comes from me
yeah why it grows up and then out you'll
see you'll soon see so these are the
Morrow's and the renovating funny came
in I was like oh my god I can't wait she
went choke I love chess and then and I
was like holding waiting everyone know
just I knew where I was like I said

a couple cos we're going to put them on
the stairs on the stairs outside the
house yeah maybe they're nearly there
yeah oh are you ready to see what it
looks like yeah
oh I like that one yeah that's sick is
that good yeah that's a good one your
hair yeah Jim's like okay that's enough
this is baby he looks really like
annoying he's like that's a pumpkin not
our pumpkins are we've managed to get
our pumpkins to here but they're very
heavy aren't they very heavy pumpkins
the boys have rolled them and then we're
going to come back for them and then I
think we should probably get on the
tractor to get back yeah yeah we're now
in the raspberries but it is hot so hot
we're like picking pumpkins for autumn
and it's actually a really sunny day I
think maybe raspberry season is just
about out but we're trying to find the
little squashes you know the ones that
look like baby pumpkins with like loads
of different colors in we can't seem to
find any I don't know where those would
be I think maybe we just went past them
Tan's been naughty in eating them you
are a rebel Tanya burr
well if you go to jail for eating
raspberries pick your own outrageous got
the boys carrying carrying the pumpkins
yay look at them all in a line all on
your shoulders we didn't quite think it
through so he found the biggest pumpkins
we could find and then realized we still
have to walk back to the car yeah the
woman did say on our way in this lady
had this massive one she was like oh the
walk back to the car wasn't fun and we
were like ha ha ha and now the boys are
all walking the pump kit in the walk
what I'm gonna say to someone else by
the way guys all that wasn't fun they're
gonna go yeah I know and then they're
gonna do it I can't lift my arm by the
way this filming angle is probably not
the most flattering but I can't lift my
arm because I've got a squash on it
ok and Tanner in the squash field which
is what I wanted to find a little
decorative squashes so I'm gonna head
down there now these are so Hugh these
are my favorite like these ones are get
in Oh cute ok now look there's loads in
this bear I feel like everyone might be
waiting for me though so I need to be
quick
we're guessing the weight of the biggest
pumpkin which is gems what do you reckon
I think it's lighter than we think like
thinking lock the shape so I'm gonna say
19 19 pounds kilograms what do you think
t lift and gasps can we grow some
kilograms yeah
20:20 okay so Jim saying nineteen
tossing twenty out yeah the biggest one
you think over twenty like Wow
twenty-one okay twenty twenty two point
three
22:17 all okay I think twenty four I'm
going to go the height and heaviest but

should have his phone oh my god yes the
greenhouse for the blood bucket shreds
make sure you sit in the feet bit Hey
yes pin us no don't spin Jim farewell my
friends there we go put your hands up
first like call out hands at yeah there
you go nice whilst the boys are
downstairs eating ice pops and trying to
chill out I thought would be a nice time
for me to sneak away and to tell you
about an app that I've actually been
using and loving now for around two
years and they contacted me recently and
I was more than happy to work with them
on this because it's something that I
already use and already loved and
already want to show you guys because
it's amazing it's an app called clue and
I already know that a lot of you use it
and I honestly recommend this to
everybody I know I made papi get it I
actually have her as a friend on it so
we can track each other's periods which
sounds crazy but it's so useful
you don't believe me there you go I'm
sure she doesn't mind me saying this but
I actually made her come on because
that's what happens with females you
hang around a lot you're in sync and
that's exactly what happened if you
don't know what clue is it is an app to
track your menstrual cycle but not just
that it's also tells you the days that
you are most fertile and you can track
your moods your sleep patterns your skin
so I've actually been putting this in
and very detailed for a very long time
and honestly I love it I don't just love
it because it can like remind you when
you're due on and it kind of explains
things also but I really like that it
traces the different patterns so when
I'm feeling particularly emotional or
stressed I will put that in as like PMS
and then it kind of contains all that
information and will then tell you like
you're going to be PMSing next week or
with my headaches so yesterday I knew my
headache was related to my period
because whenever I come on I always have
really really awful headaches and
sometimes I'd be like why have I got
such bad headache if they haven't drunk
enough like how I've been staring at
screen for too long today you don't need
to go get my eyes checked and I can
literally look at my phone and be like
nope because I track headaches the first
couple of days or the day before my
period every single month and then it
kind of reminds me and it makes complete
sense so for any of you that want to
track your period but also it predicts
your next one or you just like being
able to track things like that like the
amount of sleep you have and how much
that can like differ during the month
and all those all those insightful
details I really really like it for that
and also the more things you track the
more accurate their predictions can be
for your next period so if we look at my
last one because we're all friends here
you will see if I touch this open
I tracked at the start heavy this was my
pain so I've got cramps and a headache C
headache every time and I always forget
I tracked my emotion as sensitive sleep
as 69 hours my sleep never really varies
my energy was low my mental state was
distracted and you can pick which ones
you want so if some of them don't apply
to you then you don't have to have them
now I already use this app and so being
able to tell you about it was an
absolute no-brainer because I love it
and I recommend it to absolutely
everybody I wish I'd had this when I was
younger because I would get so worried
and be like why why is my period not
starting I don't know I've forgotten
when it's supposed to start and if I'd
had this app the whole time
I think it would have taught me a lot
and it would have made more sense and I
don't know I just really really liked it
I use it every month so if you like the
sound of that and you also think it
might be good for you then you can
download the app for free from the App
Store and also Google Play and I will
leave a link in the description box so
you can go on over and click that and
download it let's see if the boys have
cooled down we're going to the garden
center now why you sat on the floor you
look like you're Oh Joey's got a book
