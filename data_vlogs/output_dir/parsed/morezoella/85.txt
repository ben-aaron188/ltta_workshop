good morning everybody it is Monday and
another week has begun giggling very
autumnal to say I'm sorry I need to stop
saying it it's gonna be like this for
the next month but it actually is look
like all the leaves are falling on the
tree from the trees and like the apples
are all dropping there
the leaves are falling and it's all like
wet and very chilly out today which is
perfectly fitting because today is the
winter wonderland for zoella beauty and
solar lifestyle I don't know if I've
mentioned this in a vlog yet but last
year was the zoella apartment and you
guys absolutely loved that vlog we all
went oh god I'm vlogging and the
builders are looking at me you guys
loved that vlog it was so exciting to
kind of see everything laid out and it's
kind of the perfect opportunity for me
to get lots of photos and content
surrounding the two new ranges in one of
my previous vlogs I kind of briefly
touched on a couple of the products from
the new zoella Beauty gifting range
which is called snow Ella for any of you
who didn't know but today you're gonna
see a fair amount more I don't know what
the winter wonderland looks like it's
all being kept very hush-hush because
they want it to be a surprise and I love
surprises so yeah you're gonna see my
first reaction I have no idea what its
gonna look like all I know is in a dress
but let me show you the invites for it
because it was so cute so this is the
invite people would have received look
Hucky come and join us at so Ella's
winter wonderland and it's like a ball
ball that's full of snow like fake snow
I really loved it anyway that's all I
know all I know is this ball ball so I
think it's gonna be snowy and gray and
wintry and there are a couple of things
oh this is gonna be your first look at
lifestyle you've not seen any of the
lifestyle gifting yet and this is gonna
be your first look at it that's exciting
I've just realized I haven't even given
you a sneak peak of lifestyle yet so
this is gonna be the vlog where you see
lifestyle for the first time it's gonna
throw this out there but I do think it
is one of my favorite Rangers I say that
every time but one of the main things I
try and do every time I release products
is make it better than the range before
which does make it harder and harder
every time I've been ready for quite a
long time so I've just been sat doing
some emails and I also just got a
delivery I wanted to show it to you
because it's very fitting with this
video I ordered these from massillon
they are Santa Paws pet socks
I mean how cute they were three pounds
and they will fit on Nana's little feet
they're so cute
I mean I don't know whether she's gonna
absolutely hate wearing these but we'll
soon find out hey Poochie yes we will do
you like them they're for your feet
she's not sure then I got these where
are these for Madeline or next I think
these were from Madeline they are all
you're more interested in those merry
and bright indoor and outdoor 40 LED
berry lights oh my god I kind of hate
how they spell berry
that's nice bow berry is it these are
colored lights now I don't normally do
colored lights but at Christmas I feel
like you can get away with colored
lights and the reason that I picked
these up it's not actually these colors
the reason I picked these up is because
they have that really lovely retro pink
color in them and those are very hard to
come by and they're plug in screw
battery lights I hate them because I
always forget to turn them off and I
just end up having to put new batteries
in like every single time so we got
those from next I got these I absolutely
love festive pajamas and this time of
year is kind of more your autumnal
pajama next do the softest PJs ever I
would highly recommend checking next out
if you want to get some PJ's so these
were 25 pounds and I think it's
long-sleeved yeah so you'll be so cozy
and then trousers but how cute is that
it has a little like sleepy Hedgehog
and Badgers and rabbits and a squirrel
in a dressing gown with a cup of tea and
from Madeline I also got a Christmas tea
towel
it's very cheesy but it was the green
pom-poms that sold it to me
what else I think this is a candle but I
don't have any scissors to open this I
did it so this is from next and it's the
pomegranate and black lily fragrance
candle I just really liked the packaging
of this oh it smells very Christmassy
that smells lovely what do you think
Nullah do you like the smell smell it is
that nice
just because one pair of autumn a
pyjamas is not enough I also picked
these up from Madeline these have little
owls and foxes and these were ten pounds
so they were actually quite the bargain
and then I got these joggers from next
oh my god they are so soft I can't even
explain to you how soft these are when I
did Alfie's advent calendar that time
the men's joggers are this soft and I
was really jealous because I didn't pick
any up so this year I've got some how
much were these are these were 15 pounds
okay so there we go that was my little
mini haul we are heading out in 15
minutes we are going to go drop this one
off at Nick and Amanda's and Nick is
watching her buzz today whilst we are in
London and we're picking Amanda up
because last year Nick came because he
popped in because he was working nearby
to see the apartment so this year Amanda
was like it's my turn I'll have it to
come this year Nick and watch the dogs
because I'm not that to watch the dogs
last time so they've taken it in terms
of picking Amanda up and we're picking
up poppy and Shana and then we're gonna
meet mark there and then I feel like Joe
might pop in I've kept it very cash like
I think most people have been invited to
go either tomorrow or Wednesday
because I'm not going there for an event
I'm not very good at events so I'm just
kind of taking some people with me so

just gonna vlog and take pictures so

had the busiest day tidying and sorting
and just getting everything done that I
needed to get done that was stressing me
the hell out I am starting this day at
around 7 o'clock
well I teeth look really white in this
light yeah when you just feel like
everything is out of its place and
you've got a thousand million things to
do I felt like that and it was starting
to get a little bit much so mum was like
I'll come and help you and I was like oh
thank god thank God so we've been doing
all of that tying all the loose ends
tidying sorting everything out before we
go away on holiday um hello Nana you to
tell them what day it is it is knowledge
third birthday you have three today you
don't even know your three oh my god I
need to find these I think I showed them
harder they are okay so me and mum Pat
these are Nala earlier they're like
useful Christmas dog socks not needed at
all and we put them on Nala and I've
never seen anything so funny in all my
life like she just couldn't walk it was
so funny we should try these on her
again and see if she's like forgotten
what it feels like she got used to them
but it was so funny she was walking like
Bambi on ice it was so cute oh the
little book it was so cute
I've also made pupcakes which I've done
for them every year on their birthdays
so it has become a tradition sorry about
the loud oh I can't turn it down and let
me turn it down in here I've made them
cupcakes but I need to put the cream
cheese frosting on the top so that is
what I'm gonna do now kid I've already
made them look there's always so many
and I was gonna invite like all their
doggy friends round so Teddy Martha
weenie
we were going to invite Carla and their
dog Steven but we just didn't get round
to it so next year guys if you're
watching next year let's do it dog
birthday cuz it would be so much fun
they still get their birthday cakes
which is good I just need to now ice
them so I'm gonna put you down
what was that I find if you want this
pup cake recipe its oh my god I was
little I do reshat into
another winner doctor are you
Egypt well that's why am i eating
anymore you got all the chocolate
liminal a long white bread box
do you like that cream cheese
that's really good
I'm gonna do one like this just like
around what do you think Missy what do
you think like like spring this is like
the ultimate TVs not it's just sitting
down there like are you joking me drop
here are the finished pupcakes covered
in treats and cream cheese with some
with a little bit of peanut butter but
I've discovered that numbers of really
like peanut butter anymore which is a
bit weird so there are also some without
these are the presents we've got them
because they've got very small mouths we
can't really get anything too hard or
too big so I thought this would be
perfect if she loves crinkly things and
it's the right size I also got this from
the cat section because they're
essentially cats in dogs bodies and it
is a crinkle snake teaser which you will
absolutely love it's got no catnip in it
as well I have to make sure then a
little card and then for buzz this is
from Nala obviously and for buzz we've
got this
soft like crinkly toy because he loves
things like this I also got him an old
man flat cap like I can't wait to see
him in this and again from the cat
section because our dogs are essentially
cats
I bought this so that we can tease them
with the fish on the stick and I know
that they will love it haven't wrapped
them do you think it matters that we've
not wrapped them the presents I mean our
dogs can't unwrap so that part of it
doesn't really matter I know a lot of
dogs unwrap their own presence but our
dogs can't do that so there's no point
wrapping them up because we just end up
unwrapping them for them so there we go
it's buzzing him in are you gonna see
buzzy and poppy and Shaunie
all right guys wait a minute look at
this oh she's gonna training everything
off of it
okay buzzy no she weren't your toy oh
look why poor Ebers good luck putting
that on him is it gonna be really hard
he just doesn't like he knows it might
be too big then you can look you can put
the ears out and we tell you can we tie
underneath what is it card anymore
because there's a tree attached I'll
help you out babe I'll flip it over
let's take the sellotape are doesn't
like she doesn't appreciate the cause
oh okay bag that tree
amazing yeah it's crinkly old Phil's
hair cutting hair by the way Phil's
joined the dog party yeah I liked this
