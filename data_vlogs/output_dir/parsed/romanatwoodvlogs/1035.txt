Alex they were just getting set up some
cameras we're gonna have GoPros probably
shooting time-lapses for this whole
video I'm kinda like a dude with the
ball pit prank kind of past some time
it's gonna probably take two hours to do
this I bet with four of us okay test it
did that part of the roofs the highest
uh always have the truck we can stand on
yeah yeah the thing is like I don't want
I can't hold think you have to throw
from under right what is it there like a
I've never told a paper to house those
things that's so high what if um you
stand on that piece what is this Degas
I'm pretty sure you have to throw from
under like yeah yeah yeah so it unravels
like you spin it the right way you know
what I mean no yeah because that way
it'll yeah let's just see you like it
just do this dude how we gonna get that
down we have to shoot the intro dude so
dumb we could get it down you told me
throat it's a test
it's alright so here's what we got guy
we got over four thousand rolls of
toilet paper
um goes all the way to the back of this
truck which is probably way too many but
I always like to have way too much then
way too little
yeah nobody's awake yet we're gonna make
this happen fast oh my gosh okay so I
haven't literally been sitting here
while Romans been going to bathroom for
10 minutes
laughing at Alex with this long pole
trying to get this real toilet paper
down but you got it it's a good job we
have Eddie's here now he's gonna be
flying the drone today right we got that
down cuz I cannot in that much teamwork
makes the dream work
yep how's it going ready get this going
take so long you're gonna do it and Josh
with the intro right now for we before
we cover this palace okay I oh it's so
much better shoot an intro with GoPro
yeah I have to shoot at the GoPro
because it's the only thing I have with
a wide enough angle to actually capture
the entire house because it wraps all
the way over and even with my good
cameras the lens isn't wide enough so
the GoPro works perfect but I'll
actually be filming audio with my main
camera this is just video see like even
when even when the toilet paper is lined
up we can be like we got some fun toys
today you're edy here flying some aerial
shots for us houses definitely set up
for aerial shots it's a big one so he's
going to shoot some before shots right
now and then at the end he'll fly on
some after shots okay it's out of
control it's just it's gone
oh you just shot right there weren't we
in it know what I'll do one more these
are some of the coolest toys that I wish
that I got good at like I've always
wanted to do this but I've never took
the time to ever learn it I think you
could
look how sick that looks but don't speak
with the fish are you capture the whole
house I just did capture a house watch
I'll show ya ready let's not sit aside a
little just yeah yeah let's come over
here what's up buddy thanks for coming
man
tell me fun so yeah I think closer to
the house we high right I just want ya
kazumi I tell you that's it looking
closer to the line like two or three
taller look sick because then it's not
just one because it's just one we're
gonna line up the Welcome no yeah we're
on two like three it's close the fuck
yeah just line them all up and we'll
start throwing I told Alex to go inside
and get us a little knife so that we can
get the boxes open but yeah he's cut
Nick hey don't cut your fingers off dude
we need you no I need this but
helicopter whirs this is literally a
fraction of the toilet paper we're gonna
line it all up so that it's quicker to
actually go over the houses we don't
have a whole lot of time when are you
gonna start that was perfect Karma thank
you
can i what do you think how he's gonna
say ah I hope he doesn't yell oh it
looks awesome look at this mess we got a
bonus though check this out we got to
throw diapers on the roof dude it's so
soft if I feels a lot higher doesn't it
I do default like you MA yeah yep ha ha

far to break back and run I'm gonna
follow you out don't jump you don't hit
your head on that okay like jump forward
this Michael Jordan yeah that's good
here give me your hand love I got you
ready
dude this every new prank that I do now
it's just full of regret this took so
long
look at this four thousand plus rolls to
unwrap out of the bags and then oh how
much time do you think we have I don't
know let me I think we have probably
only like a couple hours we're good
best I D yeah ever we got two for two I
know cuz there's like a halfway point
she's like oh as you can see
everything's going according but it's
way harder than we thought it would be
and we haven't even phased the rolls
like honestly we have so many rolls I
don't think you'd be able to see this
house if we use all these rolls nice all
that one's in there for life
what'd I say I said take your pictures
of the teepee because they just let me
down there I was like no actually this
is my place for pranking my dad what I
say hey and she was like well at least
your pranking your own place now we're
all starting to get our own methods here
yeah this is this is the devil fingering
method hold this oh boy look Anna camp
boom that was worked it was good the
underhand the underdog oh that was nice
oh it fell oh and that was that's what
you call the pitch why don't you just
use two fingers like this because then
you're only in the role I oh then you're
rolling I've got the kick ready how
about the kick the kicks a famous one
haha
oh well one thing's for sure we're way
under hand here that click we run we're
running out of time and the house is not
even nearly covered I mean it looks
great a normal person would be
completely happy with this but me not
happy we need way more if you want to
see someone's jaw drop we need way more
