day just kickin ours off getting started
I move this truck pull the x3 out and
then we're gonna work on we're gonna
work on a little project that I have
never done and actually have only seen
pictures of that Britney's mom brought
over so this could be a total like today
could be a huge failure we none of us
have ever done it or ever seen it
personally in real life so it could go
really good or you go super bad either
way it's gonna be a fun project so let's
dig in
I think Clifford Clifford needs to come
out and play dude like we have so much
snow right now it's like we're gonna
drift in this guy do some donuts some
rent that's right I'd say the next best
thing is is this guy and now I still I
still I was gonna do this this winter
but I never I never did it cuz I never
got brave enough but I was gonna take
the GTR out on the
on I can't imagine try flip out on me
even I'm like I just it's not it's not
even worth like even even there's no
video cool enough it's worth it to me
like I fit was like a lake and I had
studied tires and I could just blaze
down like I would do that but like a
little pond we're all like a new circles
no no this is my little gt-r now right
here
come on flush come on get in with me
don't be a chicken
oh my gosh
wicked I love this thing come on let's
go party I'm not gonna lie to some
brand-new brand-new camera it is covered
in water and snow right now so that's
good way to start this guy out
and there goes the brand new camera
completely full of water melted snow
I'll be back gotta get a new camera dang
it why do I do
okay well she's Brent I think she's
gonna be fine I always call him like
they're females everything she my camera
he's gonna be fine there's just water up
under the lens like the snow packed in
and then melted kind of like my hood
right now I got snow in the hood yeah
it's all full of snow and then it melts
and went under the lens so I'm on an old
camera doesn't actually leads me to this
I want to show you guys this so this is
just a small small piece of it but look
at this you ready you ready graveyard of
vlog cameras that right there there's a
lot of footage not even close to all
look here's one right here
broken look at my lens crooked broke
bent it's kind of like just the price of
what I do
filming as much as possible crazy stuff
family stuff they all break with the
family stuff this one back here come on
I'm getting a massage chair get up lady
get up lady
I'm taking a nap and come out okay look
at flash look at him he's digging all
the way he's pushing his head under the
snow
all right so Brian's out here basically
bigoted and looks like a UFO landing
where the UFO is gonna land
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo also you can
dance for everybody about time put the
mullet on a dance baby
dude it's amazing we could totally build
a hockey rink a hockey game this week
we'd be so fun out just cut out a big
rectangle or square and we just play a
little ice hockey so here we are outside
on the pond and we seen Vicky Brittany's
mom brought us these videos and photos
of these guys cutting circles into ponds
and frozen rivers and then basically
turning them into islands that spin
basically like a carousel so imagine
this being cut out and then us spinning
it like a top
for hours with the show don't mind the
quad in the background with the shovel
on it I feel like I feel like it's a bit
of a bigger project than we expect it to
be it's like we got to run a center
stake right run of stakes in the entire
rope to a chainsaw and that way we can
get a perfect circle to go around right
you're the expert I just talked to the
camera and gotta be round square square
one
how about a bunch of squares and you got
to run across them dude we should do
that like an obstacle Icicle course
little thing and have country draw and
then he has to do it no matter what yeah
so like the one bad chip thing that we
do yeah coming to help all right we're
gonna see how thick the ice is
I'd say it's pretty neat so here's the
plan drill a hole run a pipe into the
center tie a rope to the pipe tie rope
to the chainsaw cut a circle it's that
simple
I rented the chainsaw yeah so it's even
it's like oh what's it called stencil
wow that's crazy
cane it's already breathing the hole we
just cut just like a thick layer of
white ice and then there's clear Isis
the bolts of the top right there's ten
inches whew ten inches of ice that is
thick this is gonna be a mate how much
how much is that one weight like what's
this disk gonna weigh when it's cut out
slush bomb shoot your weapon your weapon
oh hey I'm missing is my hairdo do all
right we're gonna grab some rope I
measure out like I don't know maybe ten
feet just run it ten foot running across
and then just I know it's kind of weird
to imagine what is that that's ten
that's ten you think that's good enough
but should we go bigger like twelve yeah
let's do twelve that's great all right
loop on the pole loop on the paint do we
need that straight spray one's the shoe
straight out yeah that's good just do a
circle right
yes it'll give us a good idea no I just
dropped my camera in the snow oh it's
clearing up clearing up his ice all
right sweet you know what I do now just
cut that all out that's perfect that's
amazing well not only is my camera all
frozen
it's okay but the insides like got ice
in it already his blade is completely
first into the chainsaw so we're gonna
warm up Bo fix everything and go out and
finish this thing
my camera it's foggy how's it looking
it's dripping ah I think was frozen okay
well we're two cameras in like 20
minutes so this one I I flew back now
let me switch cameras so switch cameras
look at this - now these aren't totally
destroyed cameras once they dry out this
should work just fine but uh it's just
ridiculous that I've already went
through - I'm still trying to get out
you are crazy
tell your mommy go outside she's
distracting okay camera three let's go
cut this ice do you need the wind there
now this one does have one screen we're
just winging it it's not windy out is it

snow stuffed in there yeah positive step

love with the snow this year he is like
and you he's really easy
Oh mommy with the take down mommy with
the take down like the last
oh did all thing just lift it that's it
Oman how do we make it spin third it's

bit maybe she's just a baby oh yeah you
guys sit on it dude
whoa
on top of the wall
like you do this this would be a good
perspective this will go down as one of
the coolest things we've done on the
pond yet in my opinion it's surreal it
doesn't even make sense we were just
talking today like what else can we do
with the pond and this is something
that's like I would've never done this
in my life is so weird so cool though
