like it's definitely a learning curve I
hopped on skis and learned skis
instantly I was like you know I can ski
snowboarding I've been many many times I
still don't feel super comfortable like
I couldn't just hit any Hill I want on a
snowboard it's definitely to me harder
of the two but I don't know everybody
has different abilities and skills y'all
playing with fire right now well I guess
it's ice I know it's only like an inch
deep or two inches deep but it's not
very thick I guess it is that's what
everyone says before they go through
there's a kid I used to love breaking
ice and with waterproof boots it's only
two inches deep you just break through
and get your boots wet it's so fun oh I
just came in to smell it I just want to
smell the chili oh it's the witch's
still reeling that you're in here
hanging out I see all my cameras awful
right now wait what is that
and you're in here killing those chips
his camo drone let's throw it up
all right you ready all right slide in
three 6180

that's hard I wouldn't land even if I
had to live
yeah yeah just watch the trick you got
this
let's see it boy off the hot tub down
the steps is like a scene from home
alone right here
see yeah that's awesome
so I'm not even making this stuff in the
last clip to this clip has been about
two hours and I have been pulling these
monsters the whole time
oh my gosh you guys having fun I said
are you guys having fun that's a little
better
Noah's been airborne twice like full-on
did you went way up so flat
so obviously it's been a great snowed oh
we must have just popped it cuz it was
just fine well it took a beating here
I'll pull you up to the garage before it
gets too flat look at this thing it is
packed full of snow holy crap you can't
even see the toho look look at the
inside look at the - holy smokes
our pond looks like some weird like I
don't know our hole where we cut in is
just gone there's nothing there we have
no idea if it's even it's pretty thick
though am I ready to get in it sure does
look inviting doesn't it it's the
hottest pond in the world right yeah
it's pretty strong ice chunks go
everything's got Brian get off oh you're
about to go through there yep melted
gone actually yeah you were about oh
that's just the top layer no it ain't
that's the whole pawn row no that's the
top layer oh yeah this is where we
drilled yeah oh we still got our square
yeah I can just kick it out yeah he said
he wanted to don't be backing out now
yeah you need to just hop off the ice
I'm telling you it's not thick oh my
well it's 20 feet of water under you 20
feet of water we should drill it oh my
god how many likes does it take to get
you to dip in the pond 2 billion that's
doable it's in range we already did it
you'll put your finger in it well you're
ahead of mommy that's more than she's
done no country has decided that today
because of you guys letting him know
that he didn't do it the night we did it
he's gonna do it right now prove
everybody wrong he can do it I bet that
ponds way colder tonight oh really
ice is ice for it it's about 30 degrees
where's the where's the turkey cooker
what are you trying to say my ice wasn't
cold is that what you're trying to say
why even bring that subject up if you
think that much but ice we started to
change salt ice we'd have to change all
ice today we just kicked it so we're
racing daylight it's starting to get
dark out which stinks for camera but we
did it at night the other night was fine
we just use flashlights but I think we
can beat it
we can do this oh man yo it doesn't
count the Frodo thing all the way in so
hope in the front you to say because you
know when a water hits this problem it
just speaks it's gonna be me you could
turn into afro sickle get that hot tub
ready flash do not do this at home class
well the best thing for climbing out of
ice is knowing that you can run up and
get go a hot
oh no we making that snow trail to the
pond
getting ready to climb into one of the
most inviting looking items I've ever
seen
it makes me run faster you got that snow
fro girl y'all love you should get that
wet man well if you get the fro wet any
final words thoughts you don't want
standing in shorts it's intimidating up
here this is dating you guys weren't on
one of the hottest days why you talk you
going now are you wearing the fro or the
fro gotta go with the fro you know hey
it's got to be all the way under that's
how we all the way under I can hear your
heartbeat boom boo-boom boo-boom
boo-boom is there a solid hole that you
can get down it's nothing like hit his
head on some ice come up like yeah break
all that out all that water looks cold
that water looks so cool what truth is
yo this water is 85 degrees that's whack
that's hot that's wax that looks like
ice it's pretty cool pretty cool little
ya know on uragan when you're ready your
feet are gonna stick to the dock no they
won't
this right here is the cannonball path
anything in that way could get knocked
over or hit when he shoots out can you
take care of my shorts dude I can't even
see you that froze so big well you need
a haircut
no this is cold
your hair well I told you that ice is
colder you're gonna be a man and go down
all slow the whole time don't be a man
today Roman soldier any any last words
look at me look at me like this shake ya
like you gotta save the fro was it
frozen look at all the smoke from his
body Oh flash come on flash touch yo
your face was the greatest thing I ever
seen dude you look like you couldn't
find the ladder doing yo you're missing
your doom man it's already frozen he
heard the greatest part of the whole
thing was when he went under and he
comes up telling me that is no joke on
under ice it is crazy
so the ice reads 32 point three degrees
today the day we got in was thirty-one
point four so technically it was colder
when we got in the water but it was
warmer in the air today's colder in the
air does he make sense honestly but yeah
