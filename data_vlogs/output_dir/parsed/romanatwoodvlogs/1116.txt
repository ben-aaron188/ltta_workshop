last minute like we do every single year
of our entire existence I want to be
done with it and this TV really needs to
go upstairs yeah we said we were
cleaning at the end of yesterday's walk
it looks like it's nice I'll blame it on
the kids

she's got just call me I love you all
right so we're gonna hit it we're out
and about we got to eat food vlog you
know I saw a lot of food but no no no it
just said to me the other days like you
haven't done a food blog for a while I
was like why show food all the time and
I always forget to say that was the
thing when I started the vlog channels
like food blog and we shot the food but
I stopped doing that
so I get back to my roots but the most
important thing baby we're five million
subs five million subscribers we all we
all did all of us
very funny we all did it maybe we hit
five million together as a team effort
for sure it's a little busy out here no
no all they heard was some squirrel like
right
let's just get right to it I don't know
I don't even know what I ordered it's
like a burger with pork and onion rings
I forget what it's called but it looks
crazy you got your kids menu as always
and we just killed some nachos
so pretty much already full before my
burger even can alright we bounced out
of the food area we're headed to Toys R
Us big toy store unless you probably
we're of just a bunch of junk here
that's pretty much it right this ties
that get left around on the floor I'm
sorry but we've gone too far we've gone
too far as a society if we need a safety
net on this trampoline think about it
like you're gonna fall a foot it's more
dangerous like I'm not gonna get into it
but that's that's a little much just a
little much this place is turning into
like a kid's Carla look at all these
crazy
well I know you would go crazy I like
the Mario Kart you'd still like this be
fun in the basement mr. Cain cannot
watch this vlog I'm thinking why not
build they sell these Hot Wheel track
straightaways why not get enough that
goes from the top floor balcony all the
way to the living room by the fireplace
they'd be the funnest track ever
Britney's not not even paying any
attention is that a good idea or what I
think we only need like 16 of them
they're a dollar a piece dollar 20
apiece it's a great Christmas present
I'm just I just want to do it it has
nothing to do with Cain this is my
Christmas present just walked in the
restroom they definitely want to make
sure that you do not use this bathroom
why is it in black and white let's try
this Cameron just change his settings by
itself with a like a crime scene
they're like your back to me I do not I
do not pee that long
I think we should have a race right here
in the store from that blue line to the
shopping cart
pick your bike you going with that one
you got to this one this one I'll take
this one it's Lightning McQueen
but clearly won the race she gets the
trophy she's gonna take it home for
candy you'll like this right a little
bite we need more basement toys and
that's he can even drop in on the
quarter pipe with that with this train
wheel
yeah so luckily for us we already got
Noah dawn we got his stuff which I can't
wait to show you guys one of the gifts
not the one that I got anyways we just
decided to come back and get Kane
because the stores are freaking chaotic
right now it's not even it's not even
fun to check out it's like pain so we're
gonna end up doing this last time
drive this truck into the ditch yep
daytime safe time dance with them let me
see here let me do it
put it on his head whoa
oh he does stuff too he doesn't but well
I have what I have learned one thing
about trucks especially this one
they suck gas down it's like we pretty
much just drive gas station gas station
now like when I leave here I'll just
make a circle and stop at this pump this
bad
