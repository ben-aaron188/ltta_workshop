that one thing that's you know gonna be
the entertaining part of the magnet
entertaining part of the vlog and then
you know obviously we do all the family
stuff but what's that one thing and
usually I have like some ideas sometimes
they're a little off sometimes they're
funny sometimes they're just ridiculous
and instead of like trying to come up
with it all day like I'm walking around
like what do we get out like what's that
one thing today we're gonna do this that
you guys are like entertained with and I
got nothing all right that's the honest
truth I don't have anything today I mean
I have some ideas but I was like I don't
know if I can pursue them today ha ha ha
so I decided let's just grab the camera
and film she's you made a sword to get
out of control is that bacon tape so
that is where I'm just going to bring
this camera along for today ting ting
ting ting ting by the way you want what
did he do today by himself

around and fortnight no I don't I don't
play it but I did play it I never once a
good job you took it you got you got two
kills in that game two or three that's

fortnight yesterday there's a good
chance maybe King was it what took you

completely almost completely gone it's
melting it's wet the pond looks like a

hats which is super cool super awesome
and we are just selling them until
they're gone and then they're back yeah
well they're a little different they're
not our usual if you bought in a camo
hat before and they were like twenty
bucks

different they're kind of second some of
them have flaws some they're like a
little bent and the font is actually see
