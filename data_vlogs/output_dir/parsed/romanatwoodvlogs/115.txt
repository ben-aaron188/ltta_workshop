thing if you have watched the blocks for
a very long time we talked about all of
our camo hats that our last shipment
came in it kind of flawed up there
either bent or they're crooked and we
don't want to sell anything that's not

at full price or sitting on these and
taking a massive loss we are going to
put them up on the site as you're
watching us they're on the site right
now for ten bucks they are $10 a hat

little like lumps and bumps but that can
be fixed the more you wear just put that
in the dryer microwave 30 seconds it's

again let's go grab a quad
your country's up front countries up
front brother oh well you're super
sideways country can you get this big
box here in the kitchen we need help
with it it's too heavy for me bro I know
I've been working out behind it's too
much for me bro it's right it's right
inside the door on the on the on the
right it's the big one the big one
seriously the box there's one bad thing
about today it's heat it's gotten warm
it's actually warm outside it's
beautiful the Sun is out there's almost
no clouds and it got warm so the snow
has been melting which really stinks
still got a little bit on the ground but
I can hear it melting look at this look
so basically all this it's like all our
work on the pond and like just playing
on it may come to an end if it doesn't
it's supposed to be warm all week like
it's getting into the 40's the 50s which
means it's gonna melt very very fast I
just hope that don't last and we get to
play on this for the whole winter I
wanted to just keep freezing and getting
thicker and deeper and so you can see
the pond is like it still looks okay but
you can tell there's some basically the
snow is melting on top I mean look
here is look you can see down in the ice
just talk deep look at that there's
water on top but you can see how thick
it is it's very thick aw it's so slushy
that's amazing
he's gonna slide that looks awesome
so yeah we're basically pasted I keep
saying basically we're building like a
big slush on top of the plant I think
Knights will save us so it'll refreeze
hopefully and kind of rebuild what we
lost during the day but if those
temperatures this thing is definitely
gonna mouth basically yeah dude that's
amazing which makes snow cones good
