looking for go-karts I was like we need
go-karts and then the company that sent
us the mini bikes make go-karts now they
are small therefore I think these are
just for kids which is even better for
what we want to do with it yo they did a
great job on the looks that thing looks
so fun like I just want to beat it I
want to ramp it take it down this see if

plan is for tomorrow and that is a
basically like Mario Kart we're gonna
race oval race on the pond with many go
