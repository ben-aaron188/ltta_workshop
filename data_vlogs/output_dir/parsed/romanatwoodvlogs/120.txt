country actually just saw I'll let him
tell us - hey what did you just see come
through their way to you a truck just
came through like a full-size pickup
sized pickup just flying - at least
doing like a hundred miles right over
the ice ice which how do you slow down
like that Oh so we're gonna we're
basically going to we're just gonna hook
up some sleds some snowboards and just
hit it we're just gonna go out on the
lake today look at that it's a big area
a lot bigger than my pond so we should
have like free range it's freedom baby
freedom he's gone he is gone it looks so
fun we gotta go the shortcut to Florida
think why he's getting over there
weather me seems you know get him close
I don't know if I got his - you ready
boy oh this is gonna be a tube ride
you're never
hello ever explain this but out in the
really cold weather the batteries for
the vlog cameras they only last you know
very very sure the corner is the
lithium-ion Cisco dead so fast all right
this is my own
so we're gonna get as much as we can
this one's already flashing red we're
gonna get as much as we can before this
thing dies but for some reason they just
die so fast in the cold look at Brian
dude look at him he's blazing across the
pond there's somebody else out there is
he gonna stop Brittany also got me she
loves me she's always doing amazing
things she's got me these giant mittens
they're almost like boxing gloves are
super warm but very hard to love because
I can't push any buttons it's crazy I'm
gonna wring this guy up
you ready see dog sledding take it nice
and easy out there
what I thought I was gonna clothesline
you dude you swung right Adam I was like
and I just jumped and all I see the Rope
is covered right underneath I got on the
drop I was crying laughs I didn't know
if I should bear to keep on I didn't
know he was a jumping I don't even think
you were swinging by so fast it was
coming you come by so quick I think we
were that close to you then I looked in
the mirror I'm like I seen you like just
joking like oh I think throw so much
snow the tracks just throw snow so you
got more snow on you driving then I do
riding it's crazy dude look at that guy
in that truck yo that's gotta be so fun
and a full imagine being in a foot look
you just
Daigo ball on the Trump name
just plows through all these docks
yeah this guy I don't know how much did
you capture talking like hit the dog you
guys were done right so I was like all
right all right I'll cut it because it's
like a ten minute clip already and then
I see him take off and I'm like oh crap
I'm gonna follow him and I realized
after I saw him hit I was like oh my god
I'm not recording there was two by fours
and four by fours through the windshield
dude prole I saw from my panel the
trucks gone this guy cut it but he
stayed going the same direction and I'm
like there's an O and he just destroyed
it where did he go there's no job right
out of the bank where he hit that home
my stories when I said I arrived here
that truck came flying out door like a
hundred miles per hour all I see was a
four-wheeler oh my god he's seeing
things that poor guy just ate he's
really lucky whoever was driving that
super super super lucky that could go I
mean there's damage property but that's
like that's like the least of what bad
could happen like it's really dangerous
be going that fast he's gone okay
so that uh that didn't last actually
very long at all so not only did the guy
which Brian said he rolled up to him you
can actually see it on the drone he went
up to him in his snowmobile and appeared
like everybody was okay which is amazing
and then we had an officer which one of
the nicest officers we've ever
encountered
just came up said the lake hasn't even
been cleared yet to drive home which I
honestly had no idea that was even a
thing back what I remember back when I
was young you just pulled up and it was
an interest on risk atmosphere and
that's what I thought it was so
apparently the lake has to be cleared to
actually ride on and I did not know that
so we had to go is everyone everyone was
okay though dang like the whole when I
say the whole side was crushed I should
have sent you as my vlog cameras that
you went out there I had two by fours
sticking through the windshield look at
the look at the the tire marks coming
straight in sideways boom hole there's
Brian Braun you pick sit back you fix
this old truck for me I was
one minute dude eat it that's the air
bag the air bag of the truck is hanging
out of the bowl the whole side of the
truck is moved over like like kinda done

you tell me anything you want
movie okay guys this next part of the
blog is something I wanted to start
January 1st and I did it but it's okay I
think it's any day is great to start
this and we used to do this all the time
and I feel like we all had a very good
time doing it including you guys so so
what we used to do is we basically
started with a number of push ups I
think we originally started with like
either 5 or 10 let's just say we did 10
push-ups and then basically every vlog
we've logged every day so we would add
one to push up just one push up a day
and I would ask you guys to do them with
us right now if you would like to join
us I think this time around why don't we
just do why don't you in us start with
whatever number you're comfortable with
not a big number start very small if you
can do one pushup
do a push-up with us right now as a
family all right you're with your family

start with the number 10 all right thank
you you gonna do 10 I think you said
okay so if you can do 10 let's start at
10 and tomorrow we have to do 11 and the
next day we have to do 12 and the number
grows really quickly so if you want to
start small with one two three four five
star small work your way up each day
we're gonna get stronger together all
right so let's do this together you
