there you go look at that face he's like
huh
I mean the kids on the box look like
they're having mr. cheese it tastes like
that you're busted cheat oh man what is
that car what is it baby girl but you
just get something you got a chunk of
cardboard and you want out want to take
it out who it's frigid well it looks
like I'm out looks like it's just you
and cane on this one look at that can't
use the muscles yeah oh you might be out
mom are you growing cotton candy maker
how does it even work it's like
something from outer space cane this is
like I didn't touch it cane did it the
magic wand turned off Oh
SpaghettiOs are we looking at mommy how
are we doing from the kitchen not
included sugar colored sugar refill kits
available well we don't have any of that
scream booyah I'm so confused you just
turn it on okay alright it seems simple
alright
seems simple core it seems so simple so
what do you have in the spoon what is
that just sugar that's it you just scoop
it out of a package how does that make
kind of candy come on come on it's
trickery going on here she's like she's
like you need this sir should I just
hold on to it maybe you won't wake up
candy you dump the sugar in it then you
pour it in slow like a turtle not like a
rabbit and hopefully this works yeah
dump it dump it
apparently slow okay what's a turret
Auditor oh how would a turtle dump that
think about it I just think about like
the first guy that made cotton candy
like how it was this an accident or did
somebody actually figure this out it's
crazy to me like cotton blown away right
now
are you serious you just make cotton
candy out of a scoop of sugar stop it
stop it dude you're making cotton candy
cane cotton candy cane oh my gosh the
whole room is cotton can't we just make
Candy Land
it's candy land here I don't understand
how that just worked they just turn the
car they just turn to pellets of tiny
little sugar sand into string sugar
string that's all it did it converted it
it's a converter it's a sugar converter
right is it tastes like cotton candy oh
my gosh you're eating a spiderweb
does it taste good Louie try anytime all
right god what's that oh my gosh it does
look like hair dude it melts right away
brothers cool knowing a lot it's cool oh
you dropped your magic wand or two tucks
take it tucks night you're old you guys
are both up to something sure there you
go there you go little girl
well now you want in what you do eat
your cardboard so imagine you go to the
fair or the festival how much cotton
candy they can make with just a bag of
sugar imagine how many things of cotton
candy you can make with that bag of
sugar and then they sell it for like
it's a lot cotton candies a decent
amount is it great you love it as well
that's a cool that was a cool gift I
like that sugar stakes sugar chicken not
a raucous I I'm not a rocket scientist
we all know that you I think you think
I'm
I think you believed in me you believed
in me so what the whorehouse is candy
of course over there and reading the
instructions that's good so here's what
I'm guessing it just heats the sugar up
melts it right and then it Slim's it it
throws the melted sugar and it dries in
the air and very fine little threads
that's that's how it works
I believe in you thank you so much I
didn't Google that if I'm wrong I'm
wrong if I'm right I didn't know how to
clean it he's talking about them not not
well game not plug or I love you so much

stealing my every thought she's in my
try names now last night in my dream
she's not only crawling okay she's in my
dream crawling right like a normal baby

she's calling on her back so she's
laying on her back and she's crawling
backwards and I'm just in my dream I'm
so excited like I'm just going crazy
