All Whites a video Oh so today we're
rigging up booby tracks it's basically a
trip line if it's the back of them we're
rigging up booby traps so we don't even
have to touch a snake they actually make
it move
it's actually pretty cool looking crazy
oh wait it's just hard to the yeah I'm
gonna take it if it's not yours imma TT
I'll just not already no I'm just
kidding sorry we're filming a video down
here oh yeah yeah oh we didn't get you
that good though so the concept here is
we tie the string to a bench we put the
snake in a bush and it creates a trip
line with very thin string so the string
snaps almost every time but it makes
them think the snakes coming at them
it's hilarious do we just sit down on
this bench off do it he's so obviously
we're already being run out by police
people get so upset over nothing it's
just a snake on a string I don't get it
I don't get it head on right on all the
way from Germany huh huh huh double big

awesome dude no no this is a prank yeah
we are we're uh we're hooking up a snake
out here get some reactions this is a
super-sweet area guys like it's it's
nice and cool finally it's just I think
snakes are a little more believable in
this environment with dirt and grass and
weeds and not a lot of room for error
here I mean there's a couple pools you
could land in possibly that's a big pool
down there this is one amazing view man
how do you uh like that would you look
at it oh mylanta all right we are either
moving or calling it quits this prank is
it's all right it's all right it's not
epic it's not main channel worthy right
now but you never know we might be able
to I don't know had to make a quick stop
at the bottom of the mountain we were
way up there so he Sam can clean his
baby
ah good I would clean this thing every
day it was completely covered in dust
we're good this thing code we don't know
I thought I just picked him out of this
guy strip huh
