okay guys welcome welcome to the vlog
I'm so excited right now because we got
snow like legit snow it is deep enough
to play and I know a couple inches maybe
but the fun part the fun part I talked
about this in the other vlog that we
were gonna try to build a ramp off the
drop in so that we could go across the
pond we only have one shovel we're using
sleds and we're just trying to build
enough snow off the pond so that we
could roll off this downside while
that's slick didn't realize I was on the
pond that's a drop right it's amazing
it's a nice snow shovel right there
so the idea oh geez the idea is that we
get enough speed off of the drop in
which is covered in ice we've dumped
water on it it's frozen that we can go
all the way down come off the dock come
down the snow hill and then across the
pond it's foolproof it is the perfect
idea for today we got snow guys you know
how excited I've been about this you
guys like in the snow you playing in the
snow Oh Britt brought out the toy oh it
is it needs gas I'm sorry
well you got a lot of warm up it's
freezing
she's cold you put a blanket on her
taking to the grocery up with gas in it
I know I know come on snow dog Snow
Patrol you're fine he'll move
Britt's having so much fun he's fine
dude we got to add some ice down
especially down at the bottom I think
with the sled it'll be a little
different result let's try to make it
off this thing it's not done yet we're
gonna give us our ego can we make it off
the dock that's amazing
that's about keep hundred shovels worth
500 e it's so fluffy oh here we go here

like a very nice drop off at the end
