down here baby hi sweetie
I love this outfit she is zoned into
that yeah we when do babies start
looking like a boy or a girl because I I
didn't know for I'd be like hey so uh
truly a madhouse today the house is
being packed up and reorganized for
reorganized for next Christmas the tree
is gone our living room is coming back
together it's starting to look like it's
not Christmas anymore so it looks like
our house again so uh hey what up would
you get me right oh man sauerkraut yes
sir you don't mess you know I was just
about to start the oven you know but now
I don't I'm about to show you cuz we all
gonna like it I'll show you
I need a cooking tray well this bit this
is huge that fit in the oven
what does fit in the oven but will it
fit yeah I need this foil yeah okay do
you know what I'm cooking baby hi baby
what's up dude what's up pretty eyes all
right preheat bake
I think 350 will be good think Oh so
today guys is cooking in the kitchen
with Roman you guys ready for this I've
never done this before and I'm a little
nervous to be honest
how does this work is this
no I already know it's only gonna having
I already know what you get all right
I'll do it for you baby I'll do it for
you because I know this is something you
want another oh nothing says cooking
with Roman like a good apron oh my gosh
I'll wear country's apron today for the
vlog all right here's the plan for today
guys we have you remember last year I
was able to baby I forgot even had this
all in the moment right now I'm trying
to explain this crazy idea last year I
was able to pull my kids on the xmax the
RC I was able to pull them all over the
snow you ever this year I want to pull
them on ice so I got all these giant
xmax tires but here's the problem
these wheels are huge look almost as big
as my head alright but these are sealed
with this crazy glue right like you
can't get them off you can't get them up
country can you get that off try to pop
a seal for me
I'm confused you're not really cooking i
hears if you can't peel that off the rim
I gotta cook it so you want I gotta get
it off that rim that's yeah so here's my
idea
preheat to 350 put them in for about 20
minutes and I bet we can peel them off
there you know I don't know break this
glue so we are going to stack these in
the oven and guys honestly I don't know
if this is worth the shot or not I've
heard that you can do this I am back no
I don't know it well I don't think so I
I've actually heard that you can do this
I've never done it so we're gonna try it
right now let's stack them up put them
in the oven no I don't think so not not
I mean it's a cooking apron this is what
you wear to keep like fire to cook tires
yeah you don't want to get melted rubber
all over you
alright Freeney ovens preheated let's go
let's go we cooking some wheels good
it's tough to clean this house your
button tires yeah but look they're
cooking up not oh look at how it's
smoking oh yeah this is it I don't know
I'm gonna try one I'm not wait yeah I
might Ramallah
I just took my apron off like an idiot
your birth country's manpower boy
actually no way we kind of did is it
ripping it though yeah why don't you
look up I'm sure someone's done a
YouTube video on this yeah me I'm the
one it's not you know I think they still
need about ten minutes in the oven so
the idea here and I can just run here's
the idea to get more traction on ice
these just spin you to spin and spin and
spin you don't go anywhere but if I can
get this tire off that RIM then I can
run screws up through the bottom and
have spiky hard metal screws for
ultimate traction be cool right like
spiky tires pretty it could work
you ready Caine maybe I do that maybe I
do that to speed things up maybe I just
do the screws it doesn't look as cool
but I can just run the screws like we
did with the dirtbike I can just run the
screws straight to the top and it
believe it or not it is a lot of
traction the screw tops are pretty sure
guess what chicken but what I'm pulling
these out I'm pulling all jeez jeez hot
hold these gloves oh that's not good
smoke alarms gonna go smoke alarms gonna
go up this cooking rubber and yeah we
don't burn outs in here I'd say that's
medium well hey we did it first of all
we didn't fail we just learned how not
to do it alright boys yeah come on here
your lunch is ready
hey no you don't need it you don't need
a nice day Plan B we're gonna take off
the paddle tires to ride on water you
actually are riding on water when it's
ice now so we need spikes so we're gonna
swap these guys out we're running screws
through this will actually work pretty
good let me see I mean that'll still be
a ton of traction we're just gonna have
to wait it down big time like a lot of
weight last year I put I don't know how
much maybe 20 pounds on top of this to
get to be able to pull the kids without
slipping everywhere so this part about
the same got it
okay this good job take that spot in
here drag it drag it drag it you got it
so basically what we're doing is we're
gonna run we're gonna run a screw
through each knob basically each big
knob all the way around the whole tire
and believe it or not it'll be a ton of
traction that we were able to pop
wheelies on the dirt bike the dirt bike
we ran through all the knobs and you can
pop wheelies on you got it
ass it oh that looks mean right there
that is cool oh you silly boy yes there
you go boom oh okay so we're gonna try
to we're gonna try to hide a 25 pound
weight give traction up under the frame
so that looks like just the RC truck if
anything will be cooler actually seeing
a big weight on top of the truck
and the idea here is make sure this
thing will fall off I think we can do it
I think we can do it boss
looks mean check on that tire you look
at that tire though see that Tyler Moore
point attachment I mean you can never be
too safe out there you know I'm saying
no saying you go no one knows how to tie
a rope quite like this yeah we're gonna
make sure she never falls off you see it
shake that wow that's tight
it's good now let's make sure the body
goes long I mean the bodies on the
weight are so bent out rub so hard he's
gonna down here that's just as good you
straight lowered it and it's good yeah
it is it's lowered upgraded wheels and a
fat body you know I think I'm gonna tie
the front end to all right it looks
pretty nasty
that's pretty cool you ready all right
try this let's take it out let's do it
let's do it on anything waste so much
dude
it does not care that there's 25 pounds
strapped to it it is just like it's
ready to go
you guys ready about to hit the ice we
are currently what what's so weird look
at it you can see the crack from
yesterday yeah but look how deep it is
under that crack so it's hard to see on
camera we're currently at four inches of
ice which means this sucker is solid
today did I can scrape the ice that's
awesome it's actually not as much
traction as I thought we need more
weight on it
I'm barely given any power at all
I'm gonna pull myself
it's like barely any trigger is barely
going there you go little buddy
Oh
Wow
I can't leave we can pull two of
the truck is just laughing waiter I get
to add more weight you dig in even
harder but then I tried blow the truck
more like forward quoi
it's your turn maybe if it'll be a big
boy this is been for me
Oh
I love it
see you guys
one lap to uphold me yo we need to give
you a head start
no oh it's not
good drive one of my favorite things now
and huh there you go see ya it might be
dying
oh my gosh guys this is so fun dude it's
like so weird to pull yourself on an RC
truck around a pond on a flood wall it's
like whoo see I told you what you think
imagine if you can imagine you go
sledding down hill and then it pulls you
back up the hill use them seriously you
need some brakes on that baby all right
well I was just coming to check in on
you it looks like you're doing fine
oh my flash join me whoo
this is so fun now the kids have
full-size sleds on the ramp which has me
a little nervous because you can't steer
it right so you got me nervous it's a
little Shady
okay so I'm just let me walk out here
I'm just gonna go ahead and show you
guys what our next step is we're going
to take this ramp off oh yeah we're
gonna take this ramp off we're gonna put
some plywood on here and extend this all
the way down to here so that you can
come down the ramp across drop down onto
the pond and go as far as you can that's
the next thing we're gonna do with the
with the ramp thing idea cuz we just
keep extending and adding to it and I
may be so pretty
you guys need more water you're running
out of water this is just dry wood
giving me chills giving me chills when
you go across it okay go ahead boys mop
the pool boy mop it it's solid oh did
you have a rough day flashy dude you
don't want that you don't want it you
don't want it he thinks actually
probably would fish food but no some
shrimp Greg you want to try your first
first human drink bit but she wants that
Cup she was warping warping past a long
time tonight guys everybody has left we
are we're we're getting some snow it's
with snow right we get a few in oh okay
look come here dude this is just heaven
oh it's looking pretty yes dude it's
something there's hope yeah hopefully I
know we're not supposed to get much
thing like three inches at the most but
that's still enough to get on a sled and
get pulled behind a four-wheeler
dirtbike this glass needs clean so bad
I'm so embarrassed you cleaning it right
now okay watch okay this will show you
how dirty the glass is watch this strip
that she cleans ready Wow
so with with with reef lighting like
proper lighting to grow court these are
all real pearls every single thing in
here is real and to have that grow then
flourish the way it does you have to
have very powerful writing but that
lighting caused a lot of algae and you
have a what's called a cleanup crew like
snails and things like that but they're
just not keeping up when you see mommy
and daddy do it what you want to do it
oh yeah one of the starfish they know
they're about to get fed there we go
watch them they're gonna go crazy Caine
crazy Caine whoa you see the Cardinal
won't try to get it baby get it baby get
it baby
whoo this guy look at this guy no it's
okay it's okay he's fine I'm making this
