black partners a bruiser and I ever had
which is that Universal which really
that's a suit weird and crazy shit all
all the time for one is because groovier
I can't stand normal Hollywood premieres
the red carpet setting because I feel
like that's nothing to do what the
movies that we made for the balances for
the pants so this is our style premiere
which is all fans
no okay movies about start I gotta calm
get out of here

scary like it killed the first one I'll
say that it just killed it
way that it's exactly what the first one
was supposed to be yeah it do is
definitely this
I sorted it out like you have collapsed
reverse well I like how the producers
even said like they came out before the
movie started they were like look a lot
of people when they went to see the
first one we're disappointed when they
saw just a home invasion movie which is
true that's every way yeah complaint
this time around uh uh they shot it all
over LA and hyper-violent
fucking scary yeah I jumped a several
time alright we just got to the yard
