oh my god they're right oh my man
hanging up the smile more beach painting
look good yeah you know what may be
crooked 'he's the style maybe that's the
new style guys welcome to oh gosh oh my
gosh I didn't realize she's sitting here
oh boy
I'm in trouble dude that's just
procedure see I told you you should have
done seven and seven it's perfect
so uh my dad for Christmas he painted
this painting for me and then he had it
framed and it looks perfect and he was
like meant to be dude that's it no dude
that's the look it comes from its mold
like cheese which makes it better yeah
agent wine ages hmm yeah yeah it's not
like that
I just lucked out so much looks go back
asleep
whoo that's his signature her Atwood the
ladies are in here watching over at
NIEHS one-year birthday because they're
both in it and they have you guys seen
this this is the first time you seen it
well yeah they're watching home videos
from like 600 years ago and we have an
adventure today so here's what I'm
thinking here's what I'm thinking for
today guys first of all we've been out a
bunch today with all the kids going down
our big huge ice like we added more
water to it is so slick that's so fun
but here's what I'm thinking for right
now we've got four giant paddle boards
with did we take the fins off already
all right the fins are gone perfect so
it's thinking the pond is finally frozen
enough that we don't know if we'll go
through it but even if we did we'd be on
a paddle board so you warming up warming
up you ready to rock yo Brian what if we
put a board on this front tire and it
was powered only by the back tire dude
this is so nasty we were on screws all
the way through every single knob on
this bike so we can go across the ice do
you think you'll be on a pole like me
oh yeah so we're running screws just the
knob parts on top of the tire digs right
into the ice like you could pop it what
you do you pop a wheelie on it
oh yeah easily yeah I've done it we used
to write on Buckeye like yeah growing up
yeah there's like when the lake freezes
people take cars and vehicles and well
I've taken my quad out on the lake but
now we got our own little pond to play
on so these don't have ice races yeah I
remember that
so we're rigging up the little green
machine here I don't know if the ice is
ready for it honestly it's about two
inches thick out what's the math there's
math every inch of ice holds X amount of
weight unless you want to hit that pause
know what it is okay so here's the idea
even if the ice were to break you'd be
on a paddle board so you wouldn't even
technically get wet it play it safe so
we're gonna get these paddle boards out
no fins we're all gonna well explain it
out it's just gonna be better if I
explain it out there let's just get
these guys out to the pond no nervous
why are you nervous
on the surface you look common ready you
can't see my face oh it's so heavy that
was your next line yo that board you're
gonna slide a mile you want to Christmas
well next year we kind of missed the
shot let's do this it is absolutely
gorgeous out it was four degrees today
very very cold for us which means the
pond has double frozen it's about two
inches yesterday we could kick a hole in
it you saw the kids kicking a hole in it
today you can kick as hard as you want
it just cracks you cannot get a hole in
it so I'm hoping this works good mmm get
him if I'm so scared dunk you'll try to
walk on this pond so here's my idea we
got this little dusting of snow last
night so everything's white and and more
sticky than just ice but my idea is that
we all line up our boards on the ice we
run across the yard we all jump on the
boards and whoever goes the furthest
wins yesterday it was just ice which is
super-slick versus this so I don't know
how far we're actually gonna go I feel
like I feel like the smaller board will
be it will be a less advantage you got
more surface area with the big board
professional you you live your fish your
fish you don't get in that one ain't no
fish you just don't know how to ride
boards who's going first
we're all going at the same time yo that
actually that boards a lot bigger than I
thought it was that is a big board well
we can all do it on a little board see
it doesn't want a slide cuz that snow
the snow is killing it man let me see
shut do a test we do a little test not
bad oh I'm so scared right now you're
walking where the school bus was 360
shuvit kick it my God look where he is
and all those cracks there's water
coming out bro
not fun not fun
what's this now you gotta jump both beat
both feet stomp it's strong I'm just
gonna say it it's strong uh-huh okay I
dare you I dare you
you listen did you hear it that's the
greatest this way across that way yo
look at this pressure crack all the way
to the fountain is the weakness that
fountains the weakness go ahead be yo
you hear that ignored get out there see
dog but you get a rope on there so you
can pull me on this board one you gotta
pull me dude dude look at the traction
that's amazing huh God here he comes
here he comes dude oh okay he's getting
so crazy yo the the whole thing's going
up and down the whole pawn is going up
and down alright we're gonna tie a rope
and he's gonna attempt to pull me on the
surfboard the board I don't know it's
called stand-up surfboard today palm or
snowboard I'm probably gonna bust my
block really hard that's the best place
we can tie is the steering wheel you
don't feel that
any uh precautions we should take if you
should fall just get me to the well I
don't know if you guys can hear that but
that is so scary
rocks don't budge yeah
you just plow into a wall basically look
at the rope on the bike jeez hold things
in there look at this side oh no man
that's what you get for not holding on
oh I hit a wall just arriving out
oh my garlic eyes turn
so fun alright get on that I believe I
got all my feet
send it to the job gainers it's really
cool being out of film from the pond
like I'm out here on the ice cool right

what do you remember about the homes
your family has lived in do you have any
memories anything core you got any good
memories about your first home okay
trailer park oh yeah and my step-brother
had his own room and then me and my
sister had bunk beds that's it I
remember my first house we little house
it was not a trailer park but we grew up
in a very tiny house I have tons of
memories of this house but the one that
really stuck to me was our our bathroom
first of all our bathroom was past the
laundry room so you had to climb over
all the clothes to get into the bathroom
and our bathroom didn't have a ceiling
so it was like the Attic and all the
like the ceiling had fallen in and it
wasn't like something that you would had
you would have had that fixed right but
it was it wasn't tell us tell us about
my triangle pillows isn't cutting it
basically um you know that would be
fixed but it wasn't like I don't think
my parents had any money to fix it so we
just would go to the bathroom I just
remember at night like so scared like
all these like packing peanuts or like
styrofoam insulation would fall in every
night and our bathroom floor would be
covered in this stuff and I don't know
yeah our bet is really creepy go for it
you do it if you could invite any famous
person to join your family for dinner
who would you choose mmm is it good for
you guys too you can put them in your
comments it's fun to answer some of
these so any celebrity to dinner
ah gosh that's a tough one I already
know who you would say with me or
without me that's oh with the family
mine would be Adam Sandler I would love
a family dinner without can you imagine
what that would even be like like Adam
Sandler at a family dinner would be God
what a fun vlog that would be how about
you seeking stare into his eyes while
you eat you need you gotta take us no no
all right oh yeah Britney said something
like or something she was like she was
saying something about like how shredded
he was and I was like oh yeah but the
scene had cut out and it was silent you
just hear Britt in the movie theater oh
yeah all right next question what did
your grandparents do for you that you
loved hmm well we still have mom all
still rocking she does stuff for us all
the time so mama
obviously you private million stories
but mama was incredible they're driving
doing it what about you so my grandma
was always amazing and but one thing
that I loved about my grandpa I think
I've said this in the blog he always
gave me the same piece of buck he gave
me two things of advice one I have not
done he said if you want to be rich have
kids and I I never understood that at
all he said you wanna you want to have
more have more kids and I never
understood what that meant until I
started having kids and just I just got
better as a human I got
better I made more money I had more kids
and I just I don't know it's a different
type of well but it all kind of came
together at the same time the other
piece of advice was he always told me to
build a car wash always told me to put
in a car wash
said you want to make a lot of money
build a car wash I never did that I
never under car wash she got him get him
get him car you know what's the biggest
technological change you've seen in your
lifetime and how has it impacted your
life YouTube internet cell phones what
