alright y'all done
so Noah's at the age now where he has to
do homework and it's a lot of homework
what do you think about homework it's a
sensitive subject in this household
and because I got home it's later so
usually it's best to do just right after
school I know it's not your fault Jane's
getting sleepy over there so I gave Noah
pin and I guess he has to write in
pencil so I'm gonna do an old trick that
my dad used to do in the kitchen
Britney's already like that you just
take a knife and you make your own
pencil because we don't have a sharpener
that's so old remembers for a long time
so well since I used to live out in the
woods
boom there you go you got a pencil
Bret counter needs cleaned alright guys

just so excited that I was home that it
would not go to bed huh huh yeah I think
