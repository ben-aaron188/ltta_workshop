look at this this is awesome that's cool
right but you think country's gonna like
you he better know inflatables in the
backyard what's for Rees and Cole great
job ladies
so there's a big story behind this
birthday and it's all come about Kathy's
big inspiration you mind if you explain
why and how this came about
so my first husband was Puerto Rican so
while I was there I learned how to make
all kinds of good food
reporter Rico in case you don't know so
in case you don't know countries from
Puerto Rico so this is cool I found that
out I was like you cannot get the good
stuff here so I said whenever his
birthday is just love you know and I'll
cook him a big order he can meal so it
just so happened so we got that cooking
on what is that
see that's not something I've ever seen
in my life on school and all day yeah
what is this it's like some witchcraft
that is a mortar and pestle motor oh no
pasta everybody say it hang on you say
it mortar mortar
well nobody can say it so more to honor
festivals
yeah okay so basically country he made a
comment a while back that he never gets
authentic Puerto Rican food so Kathy is
been in for days it seems like you've
been working on this I mean
she's being modest she's being modest
this is something special fun for
country the house is all decorated from
Britt and the girls and we're just
waiting on him to shop I told him five
