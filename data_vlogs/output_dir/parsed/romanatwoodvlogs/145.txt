guys to the vlog I am I have this idea
today so basically it's Sunday and I've
told the kids they can play games all
day if you want to play games today
relaxed cool perfect do it but then I
also thought what could I do to actually
get them from not playing video games
like what could I do outside to make
them go I want to do that and they hop
off the games that's what I'm doing
right now I'm gonna rig up a couple
things charge some batteries up here
it's a mess it's mayhem out here I got
all these toys all these toys and apples
frozen so I wish the pond whispers it's
not even close some of us somebody's out
super kids wanna play hey buddy hey I'm
gonna get our C truck out for the pool
you want to do it no you sure thank you
bill in the tank that's crazy that's

all right off to a rocky start that's
one now one note from Kane let's see
what Noah says I got the RC truck on the
frozen pool you want to do it yeah all
right all right that's 140 Marci and I
bet once I actually get it out and I
Drive Kane will come out we'll see we'll
see Britney and Cora are napping which
is awesome any time them girls can sleep

laid-back Sunday we actually shot a vlog

video for today Oh flash flash here's
our goal for Team RC right now we got to
make this look so fun that Kane stops
playing games to come out and drive our

it's pretty thick right oh no no I'm
just gonna ramp it and see what happens
Oh oh my gosh it's so slick

little speed that one's really slow but
it's like it's for climbing so just go
full speed oh yeah it's just a pool

coat on right there he sees me I've been
spotted
come on super fun here some gloves oh
you ready to rock okay so far our C's
have taken the kids from the video games

come right here okay right here a little
faster a little faster now you can ramp
it yeah get it boy nice and easy you
don't have to floor you'll just wreck
ready do it I got this tripods this is
what it's all about right here playing
with my boys and the ice like winter is
gonna be fun I'm not worried about
winter it's gonna be great no not a boy

not daddy okay our seas were cool right
awesome
super fun I could probably spend hours
doing that how about little punk how
about we jump on trampoline trampoline
all right let's do it
no not only not only 30 oh I got an idea
let me see it let me see it let me see
yeah you know what I was gonna do this
okay
we're two for two right now our seasoned
trampoline have stolen away game time
which I'm not gonna lie I did not think
I did not think it would be this easy oh
yeah cause if you land wrong you're
slipping hard boy Oh kind of worked yeah
I'm gonna go see the pond temperature
real quick it's gotta be dropping when I
stop country jumped in it was 40 degrees
and now the edges are starting to turn
the fountain off to the edges are
starting to freeze but the aerators are
still on which means there's a lot of
water movement in the pond meaning it's
very hard to freeze but it's cold the
water is gorgeous beautiful we are at a
whomping let's see here 38 just below 38
degrees which would be I guess like to
one-and-a-half Celsius I don't know how
that works it's crazy I literally only
know Fahrenheit I don't know Celsius
though not cold enough to freeze periods
gotta be 32 fahrenheit to prove the
Adventures of Donkey and flash what will
they do next
Tintin tint yo him come here
you hear that what'd you hear what'd you
hear show me show me show me it's down
here down in the woods follow me

were kids it looks like sloppy joe but
it's like rice seasoning meat sauce and
then you dump Fritos in it so it's like
chips and salt and I don't know what it
is but it is ridiculous and the reason
the family stopped making it is because
