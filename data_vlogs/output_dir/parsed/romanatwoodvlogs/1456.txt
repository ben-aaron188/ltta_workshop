yesterday's vlog and I gotta be honest
with you this is probably the first time
I've ever wanted to call it quits on
vlogging
I've never seen these type of comments
you guys are just hounding can't say
everybody a lot of you are having
Britney for how she reacts with Noah and
blah blah blah and it just made me just
feel like maybe it's bad editing on
my part maybe it's my fault for the way
I show our day but for all of you that
made these comments and you know what
I'm talking about
it's it's 100% false it's just terrible
terrible I honestly want to go block
everybody that left these comments but I
know you don't know you don't know truth
is Brittany does more for Noah than
anybody could ever see and more than I
could ever capture on here our family is
nothing without her and Noah and I have
such a better life with her and that's
the truth I'm sorry if you feel
otherwise maybe I'm a terrible editor
and it just comes out wrong on video I
don't know but these comets crushed me
tonight and nothing usually bothers me
it really doesn't but it just sucks it
sucks just want to keep everything happy
and fun and and I'm telling you I'm
sorry that you guys feel a certain way
but I'm telling you we're one of the
happiest families I've ever witnessed in
my life and it's gonna stay that way so

negative is getting it's getting taken
