a lot of videos my grandma yeah a lot of
comedy stuff man good vibe awesome to go

gonna go first ah coming out of really
slow though any more speed oh oh that
was not expected hill right at the tree
physics look up around the tree this
one's done good day
bad day if it's rolling over
smiling not smiling so handsome
yeah so this right here you've got a
couple good doubles got some good
sliding areas
these things work better when they're
slide yep
so all-wheel drive on that'll make a lot
easier I've got an Olympic snowboarder
Lidia it's not very good knee so if you
have a chance of nerve room just smash
this sorry about your razor strap
can almost get severe right here
I forgot for him
I know it's gonna smash the tree right I
don't know exactly what just happened
but we just completely here's the tire
here's a tire we hit this tree flipped
broke the - oh my gosh I feel so bad you
high-five though you didn't grade up
into that way I'm totally holy crap did
a supportive role I looked over you I
was like are you alive and you know
first thing I said was are you okay
first thing we were we weren't even
fully unrolled yet I was like are you
starts to drive away and the tires
rolling is just ghosts I hear a big boom
that did not sound good one your neck
okay
I was so stick this is the guy you took
me on last year and I was like okay this
is my baby no I said no I said I don't
want to hurt your baby you said no take
dang it
totally bump-out yes totally mama
Travis is the nicest guy in the whole
world like this no I don't want anyone
on anything that I don't expect them to
crash it and everyone always says is I'm
gonna take it easy so the second you
said I'm gonna take it easy I knew a
hundred percent those are the key word
is Halden you he called it word for word
I mean exactly what he said was gonna
happen there's one more thing but oh you
broke my hammock yo look at this look at
the top oh no I did that before okay
perfect I'm holding I'm holding the
self-camera we're gonna look at it later
cuz there's so you want to look at the
end you guys did a lot of damage in a
really short amount of time we were only
got like five minutes we're gone five
minutes
you bring Ohio and just ruin everything
I've met this guy for a good like a
minute that's a great bonding experience
the first time I rolled a vehicle we're
gonna be hanging out I bet you're one I
don't recommend you do it roll vehicle
is your wife oh we see the doghouse
Robyn well as friends good bonding
experience
yeah Wow okay okay baby
I let him drive for one second you know
what makes me feel a little better is
that 20 minutes before that happened
somebody else flipped a razor all the
way through the woods so it's just part
of what happens here unfortunately all
right Jeb you want to what you want
explain to my viewers are our stunts
that we're about to try yeah you put two
handlebars on a dirt bike first of all
there is to handlebars there's also two
foot pegs if you look here you have an
Olympic snowboarder and a freestyle
motocross world came at me having foam
so far has only got me in trouble today
I'm just
and he's leading the charge again which
i think is a whore way yeah it's just
kind of bad so when it goes horribly
wrong they'll hurt less okay what are
you putting on some safety safety
precautions he's always first always so
travis has been nice enough to give me
knee pads chest plate and boots before
we do what Travis and I are about to do
this is one of my favorite parts of
Travis's house right here he's got this
big concrete runway it's actually a
giant Hill and then you just hit these
massive gigantic ramps it's got a
dirtbike up here as guys on bikes
there's guys on skateboard it's
incredible give you an idea that that
rusty ramp back there is the exact ramp
that I did the backflip at Nitro Circus
look at the size comparison of these
ramps I mean that is HUGE
I mean it's gigantic watch how much air
they get
Oh Mike stupid that's amazing bro
amazing
first of all on a skateboard I'd already
be on my stomach oh my gosh what that is
so dope
wow that's amazing so much what yeah
you're just gonna launch it like the bag
you like do i what are those called
that was like a backflip too late at
7:20 Christ er yeah just one of those
yeah you know just gonna throw that out
there's something to guess like that's
like Tony Hawk with cheat codes right
there what are we doing what you have it
on will tell you on the light
Robin give me some sign
that was freaking amazing

even do a front-flip on a trampoline you
