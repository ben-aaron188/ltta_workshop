more time going forwards less time going
backwards man I like those seven you

I don't know this is it this is the
final this is the actual race we don't
race four times at this point we race
everybody on the track together we line
up a quarter link to our qualification
and we race first one across that finish
line win

fall world he does not mean any
attention that what renu-it really you
go on your own

bill everybody puts their credit card in
a hat she draws a credit card whoever
she draws pays for the whole now he is
in good I mean the chances it's gonna be
used for that slim chance it's not going
to be being like the chances of getting
a free meal is way better yeah paying
for true we had a deal already they're
trying to switch on the deal

said you're a very smart car whoever
gets here last that car pays so carbon
roulette is between you guys somewhere
out of it yeah so fine we want something
