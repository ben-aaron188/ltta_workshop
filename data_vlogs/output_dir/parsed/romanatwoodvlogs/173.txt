what's up guys welcome to the vlog today
is a little different than usual first
of all we're on the road we're taking a
little road trip up to where we're going
jersey is it actually Jersey I hope
we're going the right way today's a
little less about our family and what we
normally do and we're on a mission today
today's a mission you know it's really
hard to explain the full story but we
started getting a few messages here and
there emails tweets about a boy
I believe his name is ohm it's om I
don't I'm sure that's close to how you
say it who is not doing well he's now
been placed in hospice he's 13 years old
it's a very very sad situation and story
as you guys know they pee on the trees
do you guys know if you follow this
channel I get I do a lot with
make-a-wish we do a lot for you know
sick kids we do it as much as we can for
those in need this one came in very
immediate this is all very last second
and we've decided to just pick up get in
the car and head to this boy's home as
soon as possible he has only one wish
and that is to meet Roman Atwood and
that to me is like get in the car right
now and go get to this boy's house it's
only almost an eight hour drive so we're
on the road so come along with us today
it's a mission make this boy's dream
come true fulfill his wish and put some
smiles on that family's face so you went
I know you went and I have no idea where
we're at right now we got Gil over here
riding with us we've got country doing
some type of leg exercise we're kind of
teaming up today headed out and we're
gonna fulfill this boy's dream man you
already see some smiles today I'm ready
it's super pumped it's gonna be it's
gonna be good chase you ready to do this
I mean you're in you're already like
halfway there we've been driving for a
few hours now I left the keys in my lift
at home I was gonna change that light
bulb real quick but it's good let's all
go with you guys instead yeah let's go
but you still behind the wheel you want
you want me to take her over somebody
take over you sure she gets carsick
she's gotta drive we are in a very
beautiful I'm not sure exactly where
does anybody know exactly we're at
pencil p-town hundred and fifty three
long by 76 east okay
I'd say Pennsylvania's a safe safe zones
absolutely gorgeous fall leaves
everything's orange in the hills it's
it's perfect driving situation
we're about an hour and 40 minutes away
from this family's home and I'm getting
very nervous being nervous what are you
guys nervous no you don't think this is
a lot of pressure like the only thing I
know I've never seen a photo I've never
seen a picture of this family I know
nothing the only thing that I know is
that this family needs support and
there's a good chance they know
everything about us don't have to like a
lot of pressure well here's the thing
you can't change what's already been
done right don't ever feel like you're
wasted wish because you've seen the way
people react to you in person what if I
get there I'm not what he expects you
know what if I'm smaller in person what
what if as it work like I said I just
don't think I know about him is that
they need lots of support so I'm we're
going into this totally blind
the family has allowed us to document it
so that we can share with you guys but
that's this last thing last thing I do
want to add is that this boy according
to the family has zero idea that we're
coming this is a complete surprise this
is very last second we just heard about
this we've pretty much had a day to plan
it we jumped in the car and we came here
some it is a surprise which is always
awesome I love doing that and this guy
this guy's gonna help share the moment
leave this guy many gun and many Gil I'm
so ready Dylan
they are exactly nine minutes away from
the family's home and also we're in
Jersey where you can't pump gas yourself
you have to wait for somebody to come /
yes which is kind of crazy a lot
different than I'm used to so we are
switching driving positions I'm up and
in here Burt went to use the restroom
and we're hitting the family's home so
here we go next stop and hello yeah

it's hard to put into words but I will
