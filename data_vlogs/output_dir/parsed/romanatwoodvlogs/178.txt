down there now a minute now imagine me
just goes forward a little bit like hey
Alexa who is Brittany Smith Whitney

in video blogs with her boyfriend Romina
Alexa who is Veronica Gilroy I'm not
sure who is Roman Atwood Roman Bernard
ad wasn't a little middle name mediums
blogger and Franco that's it that's all
you got where's father of the year
where's all that lights up there is Noah
at wood that Wood is the son of the
famous YouTube vloggers Roman Atwood oh
now I'm just the vlogger now I'm just a
blogger well she can't make up her mind
kind of creepy actually welcome to the
vlog guys we are I'm actually uncovered
in mud look at this
bang you guys need some clothes on it's
cold dude it's so loud oh my gosh it's
like serious commitment now to get this
thing muddy because it takes forever to
clean even with a super duper power lock
Oh
oh my gosh it's got nine miles on it
nine miles we put on that thing
so today's pretty big I'm spitting it
he's a pretty big day because country
lost a very serious bet you missed the
bet I'll rheic splain it soon but Brian
made a bet with country and country lost
fair and square like straight up caught
on camera like he lost and that led to
meeting country had to shave his beard
off he's come up with a lot of ideas
we're waiting to hear the rest but he's
still not here which he's supposed to be
here right now to get this beard shaved
you think he's do you think he's gonna
show he said he'd be here but it's like
I don't know you guys welcome to the
block I'm kind of waiting on a country
to get here we've got to make this
happen somehow it's just between Brian
and country and I said I'm just here to
film it I'm not getting in between this
because country has some ideas to get
out of the beard and it's gonna be up to
Brian if he takes that deal or not I'm
not getting between it but I will film
it for you guys and show you everything
that's happening three times it won't go
there's nothing there there's nothing to
pop there's not it's just a giant red
irritation it's just really annoying
especially as a blogger down at your
faith ah so we still have the mystery
dog mr. smile more still in the house
mr. crazy I tear up everything too you
know you give a dog a place to stay nice
room and board free food free drinks
he's so happy right he's so happy yeah
you did that you did that to my
brand-new building you you did that he's
we got we gotta find a home it's talked
yeah so here's what the door looks like
this is what our door looks like but you
come down here and yeah pretty much
trashed it
I'm losing an environment he doesn't
know he's probably freaking out trying
to get out but he destroyed the door
that is insane I mean that that straight
would gone look at that he went to put
out there another hour he probably
wouldn't all the way through so what's
the plan like we seriously need a plan
who wants a raise who wants a raise come
on I'll give you I give you a raise you
take the puppy we need a good home for
this pup man he is a cool dog straight
up was he keep going over there for uh
uh oh yeah there look get it get it
there's more here whoa
so the update on mystery pup is that we
still have him he's still here he's I we
really need a home if anybody please if
you just send me an email send me a
tweet let's find this dog an actual home
and maybe it's one of you guys maybe
you're local and you you're just looking
for a pup I got one yeah so Saints
country's taking it to your sweet time
to get here I think we should mount the
slippers to the front of the RC and
convince him that that is how we're
cutting his beard off
ya know glad you said it that way
because I couldn't set up like that
funny thing is I know he's gonna show up
with his own stuff you know but look at
that yeah we can easily convince him
that's how we're doing it could he does
anything we said all you need is our
supporters in duct tape this is built
for fun right here super safe super safe
kids do not try this at home
yo we don't have time to finish you even
give me time to finish I'm just saying
yeah you should show I'm just saying
like if you're gonna do it we're gonna
do it you gotta do it Ryan you just lay
down on the ground we're just gonna
drive it right up to you nice and real
slow back and forth like safely have you
practiced fun yes oh look at ya look at
my face look how clean it is perfect you
had a full beard before you asked that
question it you're good
can't I would never steer you wrong it's
like a Latin do you trust me do you
trust me no RC trucks ever hurt anybody
with a kitten on it
mm-hmm it's safe it's way better
that's way but let's use yours if we
just use yours
it's got 15% more horsepower might put
your face down put your face down there
now a minute now imagine me just goes
forward a little bit like control easy I
dunno your eye you're shaving the beard
so how do you want to shave it I like
forget about how Roman wants to shave me
I don't you want to shave I just don't
want to shine it I don't know if I my
stitches on my face with the RC you know
I'm a good driver I get high drove you
are an awesome driver I just don't know
if you awesome driver the clip proposed
why are you trying to stop put the drone
before oh yeah
the drone he's a phenomenal drone flyer
I'm really just like the best can't
believe my biz homework you know I can't
believe we're talking about it Bryce's
out there watching a buggy
like this is his thing between you and
him
you and Brian is taking place at your
house that was here at your house
everything happens bad at the house all
right man she looks clean super clean
yeah new countries ready he's got a
proposition now we'll take it off with
the power water flash you king of the
hill looking sweet right now a small
more flag I know we need to get a smile
more flag dude that's just yeah I don't
know it just came with it man go maybe
we should always shaved the beard while
your passenger like I Drive and then you
have to shave the beard that's a dumb
idea I'm gonna get all this hair all
over like a like a giant sheet or but
it's gonna look like a build-a-bear in
here
we just cleaned those capes stick to the
window oh yes I could say I can shave
that beard off and just put it on my
shoulders to keep me warm
no your face is legitimate old the
country country's ready there's no
there's no trying to get out of it
although I loved his idea tell them your
idea today what the coin flip cuz I
think it's out of control the country
comes the stasis how about this we flip
a coin heads if it lands on heads I get
to keep the beer but if it lands on
tails I got to shave the beard and my
eyebrows you really risk your eyebrows
hey let's see what it would be let's see
what it would be never have you because
you're ready bad look everything comes
to you
I think country gonna shave his own
beard we're not gonna touch you
alright deals a deal deals a deal but I
think I'd do something with it let's see
some handlebars or maybe just the stache
maybe just the beard lose the stache
what'd you guys think of stripes on I
need something like oh I should like to
play with him yeah so country shave the
beard and then do like a goatee first
then a Tammy yeah yeah you got one yes
the boss has spoken but I think you
asked two questions two yeses take a
good look chase said I should do half
laughs mustache half here just shave all
this and then leave one half right I say
goatee so why don't we just write the
four epic things I should do when I
shave this beard put it in the Hat and
let chase draw the the one out and
whatever comes out that's where you go
