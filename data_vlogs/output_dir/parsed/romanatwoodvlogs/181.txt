got a giant dog different that's a
different species it doesn't count
here's where we're at we got word that
there may or may not have been a car
that dropped this dog off today oh
really
yeah who does that it's the word like
literally the most selfish thing I can't
even think of any reason to do that look
at that dog look at him nothing but good
are you you were like we need hoping I'd
be like oh I've always wanted to be gold
I thought you just really thanks for the
surprise going home and then we ever
late he lives happily ever after oh yeah
the first time I was not in the second
time I was like divorce divorce y'all
got the dog guys and it's it's it's now
in the evening it's late this the lights
are out nobody's coming for this dog I
do not know what to do I have no idea
what to do dude they're all there
already best friends look at this look
at this I mean look at that
so I'm gonna leave it at this if you
know somebody that had a beagle and then
it disappeared you may know who dropped
off so let's try to find the home for
this dog man I don't know what to do
so for now he's going to be the smile or
mascot until hopefully a home turns up
hopefully tomorrow maybe when this video
goes up somebody knows who the owner is
well the house is filling up with kiddos
it's Friday night ready to play you know
I'm really hoping that I'm completely
wrong about this dog theory in that the
dogs just lost and the owner is going to
find a sock I could be totally wrong
just because our security guards said
that he saw a white sedan hostly dropped
the dog that's the part that I worry
about that's the part I worried about
positive thinking though the dogs just
lost and they're gonna call us and
there's gonna be a home but if you know
somebody that had a Vigo let's say
yesterday and they don't today it's a
good chance we have the dog simple yeah
you the dog will be at chases house been
in here for him but then what well you
probably know well I don't know II might
have diseases you might be covered in
ticks the size of sewer rats you want
rats climbing on guys hope you enjoyed
today's vlog I'm gonna end it right
there I'm gonna play some battlegrounds
tonight and just hang out got no one
here with me so we're about to do some
duels and have some fun I love you guys
