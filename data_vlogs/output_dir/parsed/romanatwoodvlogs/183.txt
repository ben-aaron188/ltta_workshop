let me let me let me just fill in the
viewers real fast high country just got
back from Florida and apparently there
was a bet made and I wasn't part of the
bet it was between Brian and country
yeah if Ohio State won versus Penn State
you had to shave your beard that is
correct
now if if Penn State won you had to
shave your eyebrows which is a crazy bet
that's a crazy bed and Penn State was
playing away playing Ohio State at home
in Ohio State was favored by seven
points okay he said he's giving me the 7
point I didn't give you a seven hang on
was the bet this is the key way I take
the bet so this is what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna live up to my better bargain but
this is my point okay yeah if I have to
shave my beard okay if I have to shave
my beard okay you need to own up because
you gave me the seven points on
something I didn't do the seven points
it was a win or lose
you giving me the point spread right I
don't know I have no idea we look at the
video
yeah I saw I throw the point spread out
there no all right so to clarify you're
saying the bet was if they want a loss
that's that you're saying there's a
seven-point spread I don't even know
what that means but there's a there's a
point system going on let me say this
the country got shaved a bit cuz you
have shaded me in that video say you
should here I get the seven-point spread
all right right
do your magic hang on hang on this is
raw evidence on the BET right here if
they win she was like Don King scores
like I do not condone these activities
I'll play that again play that again
hang on I want to hear that but no it
sounded to me like you were pretty
confident with the voice print you can
shave it right now then what Monday yeah
cuz you want to know why there's a bump
shaving it and since you won't put that
camera on me one two three the hardest
workout ever
the clip is ready you guys gonna call me
I will do never shave but at the end of
the day you guys are working hard you
don't have to leave though that's okay
there's gotta be something he can do to
redeem himself I'll leave it up to these
guys see if they come up with some what
good country do one what is it
Thanksgiving
we got a whole turkey up in here Oh mom
I am mom by hey girl
so is there anything that you guys
didn't think country could do to keep
his beard bigger than the bike that was
that was death-defying that's how he got
out of the buggy there's about the bar
it's time for fish tank talks with Cora
Atwood

crazy bet between Bryan and country
