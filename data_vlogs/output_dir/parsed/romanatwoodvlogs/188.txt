okay so now that we know the cats are
safe we have been talking to actually
for the last couple weeks I've been like
don't you remember you and I filming an
entire Brittany and I filmed an entire
vlog way before we even had a vlog
channel it is a crazy trip it was like
how many days it was like it's a full
week we went on a trip together it's
like a full week and for some reason
I've logged it and I remembered in my
head I was like I got this footage
somewhere somewhere so I've been digging
I've been digging through all these old
hard drives I mean these things
literally there's so many old ones look
that's the ball pit right remember that
but these are old stack from all
computers I could show you guys so much
old video be cool but Brittany and I
were thinking like I would have to edit
this together it's like a hundred some
clips but I've logged our very first
trip this trip was our three-year
anniversary now we're hitting just a
couple weeks nine years so this is a
very early on vlog way before we vlog
and I don't know it's even shot like
like it's not shot like I shoot now it's
like it's really weird it's like I
showed a lot of stuff and then I would
just talk for like five seconds and I
don't know I feel like we could edit
this together and make something out of
it but let me just show you a clip I
don't even know what clip this is so I
have nothing edit it's just like weird
clips right now so I'll just push play
and there's Brit look at little Brit
that's your mommy mommy there we go hi
mom be honest Island
and we can't fun really smooth water to
store for and I got it's very rough here
find the waves are crazy mr. negative we
can't find places to snorkel that's
that's old Roman I dare so Brett Brett
made a friend today look Oh try edit
this make a whole video I think so
that's a good memory it's like I don't
know why it's been six years ago six
years it's been six years since I film
this it's never ever been edited it's
never been seen so I just feel like it's
a great memory for us to took hey Cara
now we got a little baby girl in this
giant you guys tell me um I think I'm
gonna put it up no matter what but tell
me if you guys would love to see this
because it may be really good it may be
terrible I mean I don't know what I film
at all is it just me or am i super dorky
on this trip like I'm looking at okay so
we have all these photos too that I've
never posted anywhere maybe a couple you
look great like you look great I just
look like I'm out of place like who's
this gorgeous chick hugging on me so I
will release eventually maybe this week
maybe tomorrow maybe I can just edit
this all up but I'm gonna release this
vlog right here on this channel and I
don't know you guys tell me what you
think it's gonna be a ton of work
because I feel like it's a lot of music
cuz I I didn't film like this I didn't
just talk and talk and talk like it was
like more scenic so thumbs up guys if
you want to see this vlog give me a
thumbs up give me a little love because
I'm gonna put this together I think it'd
be really cool just to relive it
reisi it's weird weird I guess I'm still
a dork
nothing's changed I hey if I do post
this this will be our very first vlog
ever true it'll be our first vlog we
ever filmed it's so it's so crazy didn't
even have a vlog channel when I filmed
