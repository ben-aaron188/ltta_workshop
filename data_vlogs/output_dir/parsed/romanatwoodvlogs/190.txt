rainy and saw a pee outside Britney

both of us we've just finished day one
of week four of our workout schedule

actually for us to get up and go to the
gym with everything we got going on a
family it's really tough so we've just
we do three days a week Monday Wednesday
Friday I'm starting tomorrow I'm we get
going five days five days a week and you
just got put on a week-day Achilles diet
like she's got her own personal trainer
and she's got her on a crazy diet
starting today so this should be this
should be pretty interesting I got it
I've actually never showed us going to
the gym for multiple reasons one I'm
usually a zombie in the morning and it
takes me a long time to get moving like
an old pickup truck trying to start up
but I might leave the gym I'm usually
ready to film like right now into if I
actually show you guys what gym we go to
then it becomes a different problem I
weigh at the movies we have kind of hide
from you sometimes that being said we've
left the gym it is current day today
it's Monday it is Kane's actual birthday
and the worst part about this is
probably just woken up and he's been so
sick his birthday party like came to
light he was like we were like
they got him through but now we got him
some ero he was saying his ear hurt so I
put some oil in there and I think it's
better so we're we're trying to heal him
up as we can
birthday party vlog first of all thanks

kids birthdays it was crazy it was one
of the funnest birthdays that I've ever
been to one of the funnest days at our
home ever just surrounded by family and
friends you guys hung out Cain actually
got through the day he was okay you can
tell he was off even even on camera he
was a little off and the next day
