little more over this way yeah some
weight around it huh is the back blue or
is the bag pink okay so you're saying
they're micro flawed like they have
flaws but you can't tell is that what
you're saying yeah the prints not
exactly perfect I get it

backpacks are normally 40 bucks that's
what we charge for backpacks so why
