guys and then we'll actually start
tomorrow's vlog same time so it'll be
it'll actually be smooth transition if
we do it properly let's start with a
couple popular questions that are always
asked us the first one being are you
going to ever have kids no more
no more no more you literally change
your mind every let me rephrase the
question now are you ever gonna have
kids are you ever going to have more
kids that's you know you're done no I
swear on everything two days ago you
were like well maybe I haven't decided
yet you change up at night yeah but
that's not fade that's temporary that's
like temporary like how much I work out
I'm like oh I have another baby with me
it will be a while
that's right can you should join our Q&A
I am definitely one of the men that
don't love you being pregnant I hate it
it's quite that well everything went
well is so Wendy I feel like this 10 is
like wreaking havoc on our video soon we
know I feel like the tent is going crazy
up here come on caner absolutely
gorgeous day guys I mean yesterday it
rained it stormed all day heavy winds
right I'm surprised that tent is even
still there oh you scoop it out with
your fingers now I thought once the
sticks were gone that's it yes oh man
he's fine a life hack he found a life
hack before we go any further in this
Q&A yesterday I there's this funny story
is actually on my snapchat maybe a week
or two ago and well here's what happened
yesterday maybe a week or so ago I
stopped by this McDonald's what's your
name Wow my mom Anita
my name's asked me to sign a piece of
paper which was on my snapchat and I
signed it and she said she was gonna
tattoo and I didn't believe you but here
she is today with my signature tattooed
on her arm
he's always see you guys all the time I
cannot believe how many of you either
have smile more tattoos or I've seen
many people get my signature tattoo I'm
always blows my mind it's always like I
you know it's crazy to me
I am honored however that my signature
is on somebody's body for life that is
that's crazy
I guess thank you I don't know I don't
really know what to say about that
actually it's not that crazy because my
R is your actual initial R yeah even you
got even you've got my I son yeah my
signature on your finger okay canes
Baylin awesomest steals chair he's gotta
go wash his hands and half of his body
now after that little buffet he just had
let's make this personal all right let's
get this this make this deep what's one
thing and I do just one what's the one
thing I do that that maybe annoys you or
like it's pet peeve or like you know
we've been together on almost nine years
you only say one you got one shot one
opportunity it's when you are on your
phone uh-huh
or even like I'll be talking to you and
you'll pick up your I know where this is
going what did I just say no idea
absolutely no idea that's horrible
to the point where I just walk away but
it is bad like phones are I think a lot
of us can relate to this I'll be so deep
into probably nothing worth looking at
on my phone she'll be having a whole
conversation with me and then she
quizzes me on it like what did I just
say sure like what did I say and then
two days later I'm like hey we have to
go do this I'm so guilty of that but I
mean in my defense I think I think
you've had that happen before
not like me I'm horrible with my phone
actually no joke get frustrated with
myself sometimes when I'm oh I'm like
why can't I physically just set my phone
down it's an addiction it's so bad I
hate it I actually get mad at myself
baby no I don't dislike anything about
you nothing not a single thing let me
really think about it but you have one
thing you know I don't like
my gosh she leaves her dresser drawers
oh man it's not it's not even about the
dresser drawer it's about where the
dresser drawer is that's the problem
it's the lower drawer right when you
walk in our room and turn so it's a trip
line the trap but you did a good job on
the face point now not necessarily flaws
with things that bother each other
what's one thing that you absolutely
enjoy about me or what I do or you know
whatever do you have an answer for that
um probably like you can tell when I get
really frustrated or like I'm just like
I'm done I'm done like you know how to
like help me back like you like pick on
me to where I like have to laugh and
like snap snap out of it that's the
that's what comes to mind when I say
what's one thing you love about me yeah
I thought it was either my six-pack abs
or my biceps or you know one thing that
I loved about you would be you know what
I think like what really comes to mind
like I'm just speaking the truth here is
you're not your eyebrow your ability to
follow me on on any path that I take
like I can't have the dumbest idea ever
and you're like you can do this you know
what I mean like you never think
anything I've ever come up with you've
ever set a negative thing about I don't
know like everything I do is weird and
you're just right there with me I'm
gonna make a montage of all the things
that I'm just shaking my head no like
yeah okay I know what you're saying like
the little things we like don't do that
but I'm talking like big like big things
let's move Hawaii you'd make it work
it's the big things that's what I'm
saying like I could come up with a
really big like life-changing thing and
you would you would just do it with me
you wouldn't say no that's probably what
comes to mind when I really loved about
you I've had nine years of your life
that's been us that's been this
almost here's what I here's what I would
say about today if you guys have any
great like deep questions for us put
them in the comments we're gonna save
them and do a real like real serious
interview together where basically I
interview Britt Britt
interviews me with your questions I
think that would be really fun and I
don't know like like I have people that
I enjoy knowing more about and I love
interviews like to me like I'm like
nobody wants to watch that but if I
think about somebody I enjoy watching I
would love to hear like a real interview
with them so let's do it tell us in the
comments some real questions not like
the same questions over and over like
it's just make up some real like things
you really want to know about us
personally maybe things we've never said
in the vlog let's come out with like a
really informative interview of Britney
and I I think it could be really cool
and fun and we could we could film it
and make it fun so that means said guys
this is the video that honest to god we
would just have skipped today so this is
that upload this is that keeping the
streak going keeping the channel
uploading rather than hey guys there's
no vlog today so please please give us a
little slack there hope you had a
wonderful day thank you for everything
