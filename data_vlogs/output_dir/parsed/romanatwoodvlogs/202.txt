odds of guy my Scott Scott my buddy was
like dude I got this red bike it's a
little gnarly like no mirrors at all
it's all scratched and beat-up

he comes up we're not ruining just like
I cannot there's no way he's leaving
this yeah spin his whole day fishing in
a pond with no fish
maybe builder supplies we need to make
it look like a roughly like a but
doesn't even need to look like it could
look like anything he doesn't know
there's a should be a black gun with it
we put four of these up maybe whatnot
crate like a box hmm he doesn't know
what's supposed to be under here right
how we gonna get a little red to sit

I know over a month time we have been
working our way up to this moment
country the world has been waiting for
this moment right here be your big
surprise it's your big day you didn't
catch a fish but you're gonna get
something Oh what you got up your sleeve
what is that come over here come over I
know how much we've been I know how much
you've been wanting this right here all

all right there's ain't no little thing
ain't no little you ready let's
open it up let's open it up howdy wait
you just stand back country ready you
guys get me all excited for nothing
how's your day with no fishing is what
it is man you know this I didn't catch
no fish I feel like it's a big red bike
it's a big red bike don't look too close
don't look too close it's a it's a bit a
bit of a fixer-upper I guess start
somewhere right
this is my red bike goodbye this is
really familiar it's for you dog thank
you amazing man let's hear that see that
new car smell d let's start it out this
is really for me know a sharp laga
upgraded look at this upgrade
all right I got probably the most stupid
bad dad idea I've ever come up with on
this property country the worst idea
Brian's been helping me all day behind
the scenes probably what you noticed all
that loud noise all that stuff going on
that was him
building reason why I'm catching a fish
because you're scaring the fish man I'm
just doing what he asks me exit ramp
that's what I'm doing
exit strategy more of a plan I got the
dumbest idea ever
the worst idea ever possibly maybe you
agree maybe you'll disagree
I need that bike I need you to come with
me
yo have you ever driven a street bike no
I just want to get right to it this
could be one of the dumbest stunts ever
done at my house country you think you
would be up for a challenge of this sort
this is this is this is X Games airtime
street bike country right here anybody
knows how to destroy a bike in the pond
is me you love ramp bikes is upon I'm
definitely gain I mean the only thing
that I'm questioning it's like what
exactly the besides I'm like what do I
get at it is you want something what
about it what about the most epic photo
photo don't photon fire guarantee you
got a great photo out of this deal yeah
and I fixed the other one I can fix this
oh we'll fix the bike don't worry about
the bike that we can fix waterlogged
bikes that's what we do now it's kind of
our thing yeah you do do fix the the
bikes I'm gonna do it like what you know
what I mean support on you like what did
the fans so like I'm with the fans to
support me okay so can I say this can I
say this we're great Brian so if if I do
this jump huh can I just get rid of the
beer flip it like I keep my beard I love
that idea if you guys don't know a
country made a bet with my brother that
if he didn't land a backflip into the
pond he had to shave his beard but if he
does the ramp he gets to keep his I'm
okay with that
dude that's a pretty epic that's I'm
okay if you street bike country that
into the pond I'm okay with you keeping
your beard I'm doing it then if I could
that's it do you have to get permission
from Dale like like right now in the
comments is this the dumbest start at my
house
could it be the dumbest stunt yeah so
where are we at where we at this isn't
happening right now
it can't I mean it just can't smaii the
ramp still needs packed a little bit
you wouldn't even make it to the ramp
Lord slip-and-slide yeah just we could
put what about a dirt bike tire on the
back of that bike can I happen can it
maybe we just do that no matter what
whether it's dry or not we should have a
dirt bike tire yeah that's that way you
could get a little bit more speed that
would be I think safer all together and
it's definitely hit that like eighty
then if you want to keep the beard man
you gotta hit it at least over 65 um I'm
gonna hit it if I get to keep the beard
you know yo maybe we get the local
sheriff to come clock you check your
speed you're getting a save into beard
you're gonna save the beer I'm making
this jump and I need support on this I
mean I want the viewers I want the
viewers to know whether I should jump
this at night maybe I like that and um I
think I want the viewers to know if I do
ramp this bike you know putting you on
the spot Roman you always put me on the
spot with the camera all right what do I
get
what do you get if you round the bike
yeah Oh what is country yet if he does
this other than keeping his beard and
we'll fix the bike I won't worry about
the bike all right bike will run again I
got just water like people ramp by
selling water let's not let's let's take
the bike out of the out of the equation
you'll gain a bike you'll keep your
beard and you want me to get you
something one pound Jolly Rancher bag
guys he wants to hear what you guys
think I should get something nice right
something big maybe something small I
don't know you tell me we could just
take a walk with me I don't think no-one
understands how high I just want to let
you know Nate it's bigger than it looks
but it's safe can I for Delta Airlines
and get some frequent file is my yeah
see ya wouldn't wanna be just wear a
life jacket
doing it I'm doing it that's I mean I
need to support let's do it let's do it
okay so we're not gonna totally okay so
you want to jump it right now right now
we're going least try it out we're gonna
make sure the launch is good so that way
he's safe okay we're going you built the
ramp a little soft but we're good to go
I just saved that bike and now you want
to put it back in
who said that buddy Brian wants to hit
it he's got a little dirt bike with a
little mud tire he might be able to come
around get some speed and hit this thing
I don't know what he's to look at these
two on top
what's the idea here Gil Gil this is my
new patented bike retrieval system okay
how's that gonna work we have a floating
object it's gonna sit on the back of the
bike right and then I'm just gonna
literally coil up the rope okay what if
the Rope doesn't uncoil the way you want
a tone coil it's gonna it's gonna uncoil
so the process is bike gets the water
and then the rope and the buoy comes up
so you know where the bike is simple it
should no I think this should do it if
it doesn't we'll just watch the baby and
we'll have you go down swim down there
Scuba Steve you think this is even a
good idea I mean just with fish inside
the pond like this is my you know baby
you caught them all in you suck on a
bobcat you don't think all the bumps are
gonna knock that out of place
huh yeah you could just drag it behind
you that's a great idea
chase your idea sucks that's why Brits
out here she just comes up with the
ideas why don't you just drag it Cora
something had to go on the pond today I
guess it's gonna be this guy right here
it's too muddy
your floaties still on the ramp it's
closed it's closed he wants to go again
he wants to do it again would you do it
really are you serious I think you guys
say that
so I hope you guys are enjoying today's
uh vlog I don't know what to call it I
have so many names that I like the color
but I just don't know yet I hope you're
enjoying its a mix between just just
entertainment and vlogs I'm trying to do
exactly both thanks so much for being
here and you know just be honest tell me
what you think of this style it's fun
mixing up having fun with the shots
making it more sketchy rather than just
vlogging I don't know it's something I'm
excited to try I hope you'll join me
with it and you know just tell me how
you feel I'm always here to listen good
or bad I love you guys so thanks for
being here
donkey always looks at us as if we're
the weird ones yeah I know bud we are
should we tell him flash that should we
while we've been gone from YouTube over
the last week I I got red the GTR it is
no longer here and totally can I get a
detail check it out you could eat off
that thing right now what you doing
little girl hey oh you got the hiccups I
hate the hiccups okay so we are back
inside we got everything clean well
it'll never be actually cleaned up
outside but we got everything put away
and we've been trying to britain wants
to do some face paint on me but every
time we begin to start the process Cora
needs us so we may not get to that do
you want to do that I just don't have
the time like I don't want to just do
something quick I know it's a big thing
it's like a big thing she wants to she's
been practicing and she wants to
practice on me and she's got all these
crazy new things so it would be cool so
I think we're gonna end it right there I
wanted to include an entire face makeup
and I was gonna use that time to also
just talk to you guys about our plans
with everything but as of now this is
just we're coming back we're back as of
now and we're just gonna take it one day
at a time I hope that you guys find it
in your hearts give this video some love
hit that like button for me this is just
us coming
back to YouTube and hopefully just
starting something fresh didn't change
it up that much I'd say overall today's
like a vlog with a mix of likes and new
camera angles just a fun way to film
things so I hope you enjoyed it I had a
blast making it for you and I don't know
still feels super vlog II to me feels
like a vlog shot better right now I'm
vlogging right now it's like just a shot
better vlog so I hope to be cranking
these out for you guys and also just
build a more storyline to it and not
just you know like I I can honestly
create a story and make a vlog more fun
with a storyline rather than having
nothing on certain day like some days
we're just so swamped with our life like
life itself so I seen more hate than
I've ever seen in my life over the last
week but the way I see it is if you're
mad at me for not uploading then that's
a good thing that's like like if nobody
cared I would feel worse like if I just
left and nobody cared wouldn't like that
I'll feel worse so that he actually
inspired me is like they miss me we love
you guys so much thanks for sticking
around I guess that's what I'm saying
more Takami we love you we will see ya
is it gonna be tomorrow
we don't know might just might just call
it quits now so we get a bunch of hate
for the rest of you I'd be good I love
you guys we'll see you soon
beautiful one of a kind smile more
you
