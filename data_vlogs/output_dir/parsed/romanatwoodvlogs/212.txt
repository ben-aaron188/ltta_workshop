are you serious did I ever tell you yeah
you did the last time you were here and
I forget what it was it's it's it's
Bernard it's good to be back tell you
about hate can you make me milkshake for
real you guys want you guys want to
shake dip I made a milkshake you know
man
if I make it milkshake to know how many
boys are gonna come in here oh let's
just keep that raw first thought that
was my line Roman didn't feed me that
line he does feed me a lot but not lying
I have a little micro here and he hears
it his ear so when he makes a joke it's
actually me human so I like to make you
look good man oh you did today look at
this movie took me an hour to tie this
you guys ready to do this today ray kill
it chase behind a big gun yeah look at
this 1930 stick it's a picture from 1936
we us we're not even born yet I was not
my dad was it big sea dog what you
thinking man this is your ride right
here and forget the little bike you need
this if you showed up every day like
this right but why am I sitting in the
back cuz we're gonna go surprise some
people that's why I'm sitting in the
back yeah because you're gonna pop up I
thought it was punished or something no
no no no this is your spot man you want
to sit you want to sit yeah get the
cramp the front or you want to have the
whole back seat I love that hello my
dear Saint let me see the side of it
come on we're gonna show you huh my
Roman soldier baby there were a real
army Hummer
yeah I'm totally in the opposite outfit
of Hummer gear right now but I got a
look look at this boom I'm not gonna lie
the speedometer only goes to 60 and I
feel like it would be hard to hit 60
we're doing 30 yeah yeah
might as well go up and see if uh the
original this is my old swimmin pool
might as well give you guys a little
tour in my hometown right now this is
still swimming us kids with my mom and
dad after they got off work they work
till 5:00 every day they go home at 5:30
and they would take this no matter how
tired they were straight to the pool
always about pong when they weren't
working
reminds me of my scoffing oh no they dug
it up no no way oh my gosh that's
horrible
yo this is sad just brought my mood
straight down Oh oh my gosh this is so
many years gone well there's still water
if you want to swim just like that scene
where all the kids are standing at the
fence crying actually it's kind of real
right now this is crazy how many
memories how much life I spent right
here swimming now it's just dirt right
over there yeah this big part right here
where I first jumped off a high dive
yeah right there really that's your
first high dive yeah we got video not
long ago me and Dale swimming here with
the kids yeah I was last year the year
before first time I was here this is
exactly what I said I'm so excited to
see the water in the pool wow you know
this is bummer Oh mom let's not lose our
mood no maybe maybe maybe they just
building a better pool maybe just
getting an upgrade old millas por skip
what they do with their diving boards
I need diving boards yo whoever is in
charge of this pool
I want your diving boards how do I get
the diving boards oh that would be sweet
okay so we've uh we've worked over it so
we've done the Hummer Hummer it's cool
right that's cool but can you crush a
car with a Hummer I mean you probably
could but uh I don't know man something
else I feel like this will this would be
better for for what we want to do right
and this guy is this street-legal so
what is something like this way like
30,000 30,000 what do you think of that
big dog
and I'm gonna drive this over some cars
yeah those cars right there yeah that's
what this thing you're gonna find out
I've never driven a tank before by the
way and this is like you know that's one
of your babies right you do all the work
on this thing yeah what's the most
common thing that goes wrong we tear up
rubber wheels oh these are rubber whoa
how about some history about the tank
where's the tank come from what kind of
trick is this reddish it's called an
fv432 okay F V stands for Fighting
Vehicle and for 32 years the designation
truly it's an armored personnel carrier
so we can look in the back so you think
this thing's ever been through battle
don't get involved into stuff that's old
whoa oh my god and they actually still
use the British army still uses these so
this is the inside of the tank and it is
absolutely great this all have functions
cool these like the inside of my pinball
machine in here yeah it's got the crazy
amounts of wires in core I never expect
that well this is this is good filters
about a zero that's good oh yeah yeah
don't never driven the tank we're gonna
take a quick class here this is rugged
stuff man there's like no no comfortable
way to climb into a tank fast but look
at the controls okay so what's my move
yeah it's a big pedal to excel okay
that's my guess there's a little one on
the floor the red one that's an engine
kill all right so that'll shut the tank
okay like driving off yeah caterpillar
so they're driving this all a sweet pea
Facebook magazine time yeah so pull pull
back and that's that's actually where
it's gonna break this is as far as the
missiles right yeah you ready John
buckle up dude I'm not sure I'm going
over these these vans
minivans are you nervous yeah take this
sucker mom no more minivans how are you
gonna get to practice
and it filled John felt like the best
way to order drive-thru give me my food
imagine if there was a car in front of
you officially driven a tank holy crap
it literally just puts perfect pass
through the cars oh my gosh man I just
so much weight I think you said 30,000
pounds it just eats these cars you
didn't leave anything in there did you
did you leave anything in there you
might I really did this door open you
can still drive it I think let me just
look at the glass through the steering
wheel these kids because they're
everywhere you dropped the ball twice
today you gotta hit it your little joke
in the ice-cream shop yeah there we go
get it John and just like that we are
after we just crushed caught we crushed
atomic cars really hard to film luckily
chase grabbed my camera and filmed the
one for you guys otherwise I wouldn't
had any of them on camera because I was
so busy driving the tank you're welcome

that but I did that we're headed home I
