what up guys welcome to the flog it's a
bit noisy here I've hired quite the crew
to come out today and try to fix up the
property make it look nice I want to
introduce you to each one of these
pieces these hard-working individuals
we've got flash chillin here chase on
the leaf blower Brian Matusz
we've got the man country over here
blowing rocks okay
basically we're basically trying to
piece this place back together it's
looking nice looking clean flashes like
you're taking all the fun out of it how
am I gonna get under the porch if you
take it all apart okay so much more more
quiet in here okay
we're going out and doing some big air
you guys then who's in you guys then
you're not come on Bubba string shorts
you didn't reach I got something I guess
we need some big air big air competition
today I think you might still hold the
current record that's not good no big
air competition happening you in honey I
need referee you could ref it if you
don't want to fly man I thought I'd be
so excited okay I need you
we're getting ready 10 minutes countdown
who's ready who is ready for big air
2017 country you ready to send some men
flying through the sky listen they're
going out farther than ever and you know
what the word of the day is listen
listen listen listen chase are you ready
to touch the clouds with your red dad
hat no no I'm not Brian are you ready to
fly what am i what am I trying to do
listen anybody can get big air on a blob
all right but today I'm gonna show you
what what the challenge is and how we're
gonna do it follow me if you look so
worried is oh hi I mean most of time you
climb out to the blob you sit on the red
part somebody jumps up and launches you
but today big air you will ride in the
raft on the end of the blob and you will
you will boat your way to the top it's a
simple rule
you're gonna carry the boat to the end
of the Blom we're gonna hop in the boat
we can do a two-seater and all you have
to do is sit in the boat and then
country
captain cannonball here is gonna jump
off boom hit the tip it's in the sky
rock it is according to much ASAP
it is not 90 degrees so I cannot get wet
on this day oh you little feline I hope
you're ready put some shorts on girl
make a deal with you if you don't want
to do the raft with yours you can ride
the hot dog that's the only two options
all right hot dog you can probably get
off easier did you bring your swimsuit
huh you gotta go in your birthday suit
Shaboom God everyone says party poopers
around here what chase don't even want
to do it 86 top she got it you know make
sure she's running good you know we just
added some air to her I want to make
sure you know most people tune their
cars up before a stunt I'm gonna tune my
little boat up and we're saying that
maybe I should hold the or so that I
don't get tangled up and I'm when we're
flying through the sky this stupid is
this dumb bad idea I don't know I know I
know when your speech slows down it's a
bad idea no I think it's a great idea
just like you thought the same idea that
put me to put me in that NASCAR I think
this is a great you don't want to change
clothes you're good just like that oh my
gosh oh you guys bringing out all the
toys everybody's in pants you got stand
up you got it you got it all geez
you got it you're doing great if she
falls right now you guys are gonna see
some epic
screaming what you think gain don't flip
so without further ado boys we are gonna
climb the tower the new tower we've
never even jumped off of and we're gonna
attempt this no practice runs nothing
just getting this to the end of the
blobs gonna be funny like how it might
be gonna carry it out there you just
jump with it and walk it out you know
how hard it is to walk on that blob it's
very hard right now I'm just a guy who
just lands into a particular circle a
little it's a lot different now with
this extra story on here geez here we go
all I got to do is get this raft out
onto the end of this blob doesn't look
that difficult but that thing's like
walking on ice I'm just super happy
right now if it is gonna be tough but
you gotta take your time should we
should we do a warm-up or just go for it
I think because we have never jumped off
this ever we have no idea what the the
magnitude of this leap is it could be a
I think that's the greatest thing about
it you don't know and we were going so
high just off this rail imagine office
I'm in want to take on these whitewater
rafting experience basically I guess
it's a waterfall drop that's all there
we go
oh good job I just know how you fairly
you're in so I don't think people will
understand how I am on this deck the
Roman say hello how you doing buddy man
Roman I'm not gonna lie the drop on here
is insane so I need to hit that black
circle to order to send Roman just
flying man Roman is intimidate and I'm
not gonna lie to you Roman I think if I
jump off it is you're gonna land in
someone else's pond I don't know where
you're gonna land but you landed
somewhere hey but how you think dad's
gonna do do you have the medical kit
ready for him
listen it's a it's my medical kit has a
bunch of blue Jolly Ranchers in there
just in case he needs
oh I feel like incredibly lucky I'm like
actually rowing in the air trying to
paddle my way out of death fell so I
couldn't see anything many I couldn't
see anything like nothing I just did all
my face is hilarious though it was
genuinely scared because I couldn't see
I was just like I lost vision cuz the
raft went above me for a minute
then I started tipping down I was just
like I gotta get out of this raft I got
really lucky I saw I just kept laughing
