okay guys we are going to try something
that I've just almost never do I can't
think of a time that I've come on here
and kind of spoke to you about some
problems that I'm having I use my vlogs
you know I use my vlogs I use my vlogs
for positivity I push you guys I like to
when you watch these vlogs I'd like you
to leave maybe a hair more motivated
more happy just I like my vlogs to pick
you up and I use my vlogs for good I try
to push you in and just create
positivity and I just feel like real
problems that I'm a normal person we all
have problems and I do eye problems all
the time and I just choose not to share
them in the vlogs because it will I
choose not to show them because I I
don't want to bring the mood of the
channel I don't want to bring the mood
of the videos down so I'm gonna just
speak from my heart right now and kind
of explain to you what is going on why
I'm in the position I'm in right now
which is I'm in Chicago I don't have a
vlog I'm working on this big project I'm
so stressed that I don't even sleep at
night I this this project guys is when
you see it you're gonna see nothing but
the great you're gonna use wow I can't
believe that Roman did this it's all
huge it's all right but the stress
behind it and in that the fight behind
it and that just the the it's it's
absolutely I can hardly explain it it's
one of the most stressful things I've
ever done and it's very difficult I
don't even feel like it's my project
like it's been taken over by so many
people and I just wanna I kind of just
want to spit ball with you guys and if
this is so boring you can turn it off
right now but I need I need you to hear
this so that you understand where I'm at
right now when I started the project it
was it was your product Romans project
your project your this is yours you're
gonna do what you want and then I signed
to do this project and it instantly just
became their project and it is it's just
it's eating me alive and I'm trying to
balance it with the vlogs and I see the
channel dropping I'm sacrificing my
channel for this project in the project
that it's not all bad I mean what we're
doing for these families these kids is
absolutely amazing
and I'm proud of it I'm so proud of it
but to get to these moments is so hard
guys and I don't want to sound like I'm
complaining I don't want to bring the
mood down but this is where I'm at right
now I'm struggling to vlog because of
this project I'm struggling on the
project overall I have to leave my
family which is just terrible but I mean
that's a job and there's a million jobs
where you have to leave your family I
that that's that's not an excuse but it
you know at this point
it sucks leaving my family I hate it I
know you guys hate when I'm not with the
family it's just where I'm at right now
and I just want to try to just speak to
you guys about this like I don't come on
to my vlog ever and just kind of vent
where I'm at in life like Brittany and I
just had a long phone call about how
excited we are to just vlog again just
us us not I'm not kidding I have a
person that walks up to me and says you
can't put that in the vlog and that eats
me away because there's so much of me
that's like I honestly want to be like
well screw you I'm putting in the blog
but at the same time I have to protect
the project that I signed up for and it
just is beating me up
it literally is beating up it's such a
nightmare right now so I asked for
forgiveness on mic my energy on the
vlogs my lack of vlogs I've been
skipping days I'm so I hate even bring I
hate even talking I'll be surprised if I
actually even upload this as I'm
speaking right now I'm thinking there's
no way that I'm gonna upload this I just
sound like such a baby and I don't know
what else to do I have just a couple
more weeks and I'm done I'm done with it
completely and I'll be able to focus
back on this until then I'm just
struggling mentally trying to sleep like
it's just it's been rough guys so thanks
for being here if you're watching right
now you watch everything so thank you
for that I could go on I feel like I
could talk to you guys for hours about
this but I don't want to get too deep
into it I don't want to I don't want to
make it sound worse than it actually is
is you know it's bad but
it's a couple more weeks we're gonna get
through it and then the vlogs and me
back to normal back at home back with
family and I promise you that I've
learned such a huge lesson with this
project like I know where I know where
my lane is and I know where I need to
stay so thank you guys so much I don't

embarrassed actually about it so be easy

everything that I have and I want to
make all this up to you guys it drives
me nuts I cannot stand it I literally
