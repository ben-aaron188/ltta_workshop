you remember the weight the actual
weight for Cora was like a lifetime for
us even for the vlogs it was every day
like we thought she was coming and she
did and now she's already 6 weeks plus
old and it's just blowing our minds
like what is that crazy red looking box
thing there's just there's no thought
like no thought she doesn't know red she
doesn't know Fox she doesn't know
anything it's like what are you looking
at like what wouldn't you as a baby I
wish we could just remember something so
before we get too deep in this vlog
yesterday I told you guys I was gonna
attempt to use a brand new vlog camera
and get a bigger camera more of a DSLR
style to 6500 but I tested it a whole
bunch today and it was a little shaky
and I don't know if I'm doing something
wrong I've got Image Stabilizer on
regardless I didn't like it as much as
this camera so for now I'm just gonna
continue to roll with this which is a
brand new Canon camera and hopefully it
looks good
I feel like it does you got all the
coolest toys speaking of new toys we did
