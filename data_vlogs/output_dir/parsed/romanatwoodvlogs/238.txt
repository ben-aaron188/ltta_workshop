welcome to the vlog guys welcome to baby
cores vlog this is gonna be all about
core today how's that comfortable good
morning baby girl hey sweetie
six weeks Sunday can you believe that
yeah you and me both by the way I just
wanna let you know Brittany is she's
with a man look at this look that's
about a month's worth of work but I'm
working towards it
today's our anniversary I made my
husband really how many years we've been
together 17 married for 12 oh my gosh
who are you no just kidding I'm just
kidding I want to check on Britt but I
feel like she's taking this over Brett
hey I'm just starting the vlog just
wanna say I started the blog I've seen a
minute okay
six weeks look at you she's definitely
growin seven I got back to my vacation I
was like oh my gosh she looks so bad I
left for a week and you know when you
see something every day you don't notice
the change but I left for the week
definitely a big change like everything
looks different it's country all you're
doing oh no what is he doing this cannot
be good
you just out here on top of the little
mini the mini mega let that go and you
just brought it back up everyone's
asking me really and they want it they
want the beard flip I never flip no bike
before there he is
what's up my man this is your tower this
is your lookout tower come on in come on
buddy I'm not coming they're all coming
here's the thought you wouldn't have to
do the exit the escape hatches in the
pond that's crazy by the way we died the
pond it looks beautiful I want to show
you but I don't know where the best way
be the drone it's crazy it's like it
almost looks blue - odana bright blue it
looks like a swimming pool which is
crazy you wouldn't have to use this for
the flip and you don't have to flip off
this I don't know you can do like what
like
we've been doing when we go through the
yard you know you rescued the baby
that's perfect so you don't have to use
this it's just like this is a this is a
maybe maybe some practice you get to
this they even doing the flip on that
it's not gonna be easy you know it's
easier than you think it is you've done
the unthinkable of any person has done
before and let it done a back flip off
the nitrous first time first try first
no epic thing I've ever seen so far
you're like witness in my eyes if
someone doing something for the first
time and landed it I mean that's pretty
awful you used to doing things like I'm
not used to doing this at all Roman I
don't think anything like that I'm with
you I'm used to doing
I definitely changed your life this year
you've done some crazy things this year
oh wait we stepping it up too
what else you doing what are you doing
what are you starting with my mom this
week oh we're doing school this Suba and
we can start calling you shark bait
that's right we're going scuba diving
guys in case you missed the vlog where
we talked about this beard flip the idea
was that country has to land a backflip
or he has to shave his beard
that's a horrible deal I don't even know
how did that even get into the guts a
horrible deal you got so ripped off I
actually feel bad about it and and the
one will really actually entertain that
is Dale my brother was a convincing he
could be like a sports entertainer can
sell anything he can sell anything Dale
and I grew up in sales which is crazy
that you say that Dale can sell he
convinced you to shave your beard if you
don't land it's a double movie you have
to do attempt a backflip but you have to
shave your beard oh and I just and I
don't know and I just fell into the trap
okay guys so I got home and what if you
get slide that looks like a splint on
wave that's yeah it's a splinter our
drop tower is done at least I think I
think we should paint it or something
puts like some big arrows or something
cool on it or maybe Nitro Circus gives
us a big sticker for our mini ramp I
don't know
that'd be cool maybe we could put some
litter in and go down and to put spa
more yeah definitely
for sure Oh awesome I mean I can't do it
but somebody can do that be
it said smile Morgan across that would
be fall on it at least I know like
before my face like I need some smile so
it's really hard to tell on camera but
the water is uh it's like a blue
turquoise the whole pond now is like a
turquoise blue what are you doing with
that
you gotta bury the beard
hashtag bury the beard baby building the
grave for his deck trying to get angle
this pond it shows the color of the
water obviously you guys seen it before
and it was like I almost was just mud
from all the rain it would rush down in
these fields and fill it with mud now
we've got it all closed off she's coming
to life she's almost starting to look
like that photo I posted way back when
on Twitter so you can kind of tell it's
I don't know it looks dark green but
it's like a bright blueish aqua it's
hard to explain there's a little bit
school bus still sitting in the exact
same spot as we left it I feel like you
guys know I've been guy was gone for the
week working on the big project and then
I came home and I feel like I did a very
poor job at just coming back home and
and and showing you guys everything and
keeping you up-to-date on the house I
just did a bad job of that so that's
kind of what today is
