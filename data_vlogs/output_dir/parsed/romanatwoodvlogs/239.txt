to be honest I'm actually kind of
embarrassed to show you guys this place
but it's real life it's like I'm sure
your garage is dirtier basement your
room so you can relate to this you know
we're not perfect we're not perfect
ready to play let's do it so we got
everything from power washers to
generators to bikes the toys to trikes
lots of things to choose from and but
you've never even wrote a dirt bike in
your life right never maybe today's your
day you'll and the back flip I've wrote
canes yeah I haven't put it in any gear
but first right well that counts if you
write it you sat on it I wrote it I
don't remember maybe yeah
you're all set I've been out here
warming up got them all one day hadn't
been ridden for a while so I had to put
new gas and I'm starting I'm let them
warm up they're ready man you guys are
pumped
we got the huge dirt field out here and
I was thinking maybe we just start
working a track into it and then I don't
know see how they like it
yeah it has been it's been too long you
want to ride that one
so I know III think this one you could
definitely hang you wanna write this one
hey man that was you I was just kidding

your baby especially do you guys know
I've been out of town and my dad's
picnic table I got for his birthday he's

today take it to his house wits there
when he gets home and you guys ready
let's go do some riding boss hi let's
get these kids rolling we're gonna have
to build some Hills come on dudes oh
yeah so we got this giant field we
really don't use we could maybe build a
little track out here is this perfect
right what if we just start if we just
follow each other's tracks and we stay
on those tracks we'll build our own

mommy and Cora Dylan Tommy time with
Cora and mommy she's too tired did you
guys ever think like all the crazy stuff
we do we do tummy I thought it was a
mallard duck good look at these fancy
instructions and killer tools look at
that this is piece of cake you know what
to say your customer
that's personal thank you very much for
your recent purchase we love you the end
boom
filled me now I actually built my own
cat town I know it's way awesome I know
yeah sorry I get sexy definitely so we
all we all know who's doing the work we
all know is building this per square
inch I got it I got it
welcome to the madhouse what is this
when you think what you think nitro you
build a little a mini ramp that rides
down you need your own mega ramp so we
build it wrong we you I didn't have any
part of this but we can force
instructions ever ever and ever ever and
I'm a pretty good instruction follower I
got a sec I these through the same okay
but that goes on the very tops
they don't count no no I'm saying to
hide reference we need someone in
shorter than this oh it's this way oh
but then when you take this and put this
here that now is gonna be too hot I know
can't figure it out it's a mystery
unless we use the wrong one down here
can't beat one that short boom we don't
need one that room part you know these
think these things should come with like
a crew you know ours catch we should
come with a crew that just builds the
tree for you because this instructions
right here boys let me tell you
something let me tell you how they mark
these poles they mark them by
millimeters so you should just know that
p7 is 400 millimeters long how do you
know how do you know which one's 400
millimeters if we were anywhere but
America you'd pull out your tape measure
and everything would already be in
millimeters really we're the only ones
to use centimeters the standard inches
right baby
I sound like war right now yeah you know
what did you do it shipped like that bro
enjoy your half built our nitro tux they
ain't even interested they want to play
with the baby's toys now why not just
make them all that look they're all
different heights all of them look how
close this one is they don't line up
that's your cat tower baby enjoy the
good news is
don't work you can use this as a paint
roller yeah there you go
go give me a so I know I'm not so on it
are you doing Keane all the kiddies in
there yeah Jane are you in there
doesn't even line up though okay it's
look it's been in you know what they
think differently overseas like that's
perfect
it's not perfect it's that my cats gonna
fall off their glue should I go get the
duct tape now got the glue don't glue it
you don't look okay so they're long
screw that goes up through the bottom is
it long enough to actually go inside the
threads where you got a deep well I have
an idea

jumping into the night I was actually
gonna end it in the morning but I
decided to just come out here the kids
are asleep everybody's in bed core is
finally asleep and out we were just like
crashing like and I was just gonna pick
it up in the morning but I decided to
just walk out here in this now and just
wrap it up for you guys thank you so
much for being here you know when I got
home I want to tell you a quick quick
story before I get off here today um
when I got back from my trip I got here
I came together as a family it felt
great and Kane he has never ever asked
this before one of the first things he
said was are you filming tomorrow and it
was so weird that he asked me that maybe
because we've been taking more breaks
lately but Kane said are you filming
tomorrow and normally I would just say
yeah we're gonna film tomorrow but I
said well what do you want me to do and
he said to not film tomorrow so if he
would ever ask me that question I feel
like I would just say well this is what
we do this is how we work this is how we
make a living but all I said was
I won't film I'm not gonna film so
that's kind of where these last two days
came from a little bit of inspiration
from Kane it's kind of like I don't know
where it came from and the kids really
had never asked that before but when he
asked me I just said okay fair enough
done so that's where that came from I
know a lot of you so mad at me for uh
taking a day or two like always and and
that's fine like I must be doing
something right if you're mad at me for
taking a break right like if nobody was
upset then and then I think that would
mean that nobody cares you know I see a
piece but um if I break guys it's always
for the family and that does always come
first no matter what like there is no
second to that it's always gonna be that
way so I just upload when we upload I
love you guys I do try to stick I just
did 14 days in a row its record-breaking
all right guys I'm a zombie I will see
you tomorrow you're beautiful thanks for
sticking around either way maybe we lose
a few each break but I gotta tell you my
family's so happy with those two days
like you cannot believe how how
different it is than putting a camera up
it's just I can't explain it I gotta go
I love you you are beautiful
you're one of a kind smile mwah
you
