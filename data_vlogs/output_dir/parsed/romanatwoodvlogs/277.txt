up when we got this garage I thought
that it was gonna like I would never
need any more space when we built smile
more when we built this place it was so
big to us there was no way we could ever
fill it like in my mind it was it was
the place and now everything's full SMAW
was for the upstairs
completely for in fact the builders that
are building my towers and docks they
built this building and they went
upstairs and said you cannot put another
thing up here it is not rated for this
kind of way peuta Gras I mean I mean

wants to continue this vlog in the
current day in case something happens
tonight but the more I think about it
even if you were which I don't think you
are tonight even if you did I feel like
it would take me more than tonight or
tomorrow to edit it all anyway so this
vlog might as well end here and if
something did happen tonight I would
have all tomorrow to put that together
for you guys so that would be that's
going to be tricky on the on the time
you know what I mean to line that up
right so that's going to be tricky one
I'm not going to worry about it though
whatever happens happens and we'll get
it we'll get it eventually
