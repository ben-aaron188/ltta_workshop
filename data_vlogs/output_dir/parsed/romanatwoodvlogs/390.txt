welcome what came to see me welcome guys
welcome to the vlog can you ready whoa
it's dark got it I don't want to start
today's vlog like this the Zeus has to
like literally have to go to the vet
right now it's okay baby
he says this has to have a friend to
play with so that's why Cain's Noah yeah
he's been acting very very ill he's been
laying around he doesn't even want to
play ball and he's been drooling like
just watch the drone he doesn't roll
ever unless there's like a steak in
front of the face so Brenner mom just
got an appointment after that right now
so they're going to run Zeus in and hope
and pray that everything is fine my dog
is breaking my heart man Zeus you're
breaking my heart buddy and you know
what really did it was that picture you
found Wes you're young and healthy buddy
enjoy it this is what's killing me
Brittany Thomas phone I posted on
Twitter maybe two three days ago but
look at this man
look at baby Zeus man Zeus look at me
look at that you do see a feeling like
their body
you can't see him so this is the first
time taking just an office get walking
running off of me let's put a blanket
down and just going to sleep as much
hair out as I can he's so hairy
we literally have the two Harry's dogs
eating it I it looks like he's doing
okay
he loves going for rides so he's
probably really enjoying this since he
left me eat it laying with me so she
came in and took his temperature he does
we consider like a fever so it's
definitely not feeling good we just have
to bear out why so the doctor will be in
soon hang up this little cute bunny so
the doctor came in Menomonee doesn't
move
insanely hard to share and it's been
really hard to kind of put it in the
vlog actually today Britain even tried
sewing and she couldn't I don't want to
believe it so I think we're going to get
a second opinion hundred percent from
what the doctor said and you can see
Lucis like starting to bloat big-time
What did he say he said he took an x-ray
and he said his whole abdomen is full
fluid so he said it's either cancer or
lung disease he said I can do blood work
and everything like that but either one
you're not gonna have very long he just
said spend our time wisely with him come
here baby
all of this dog I don't believe it I
don't believe it we're going to get a
second minute ie straight-up said spend
as much time as you can with him because
he is eating still that's true so a good
fine I guess while I'm doing okay right
now I mean when Brittany got home it was
really rough to hear but a little time
has passed and I guess while I'm doing
okay with this is that this is in pretty
good spirits like I can tell he doesn't
feel that great he has a little
temperature but he's in good spirits he
just brought his ball out he got him a
new ball we got in the new ball he
doesn't want to chase the ball he
doesn't want to play ball but he oh my
gosh man what I love thinking about I
got to stop vlogging this like I'm gonna
frame off it's all good like I don't
know what to do it is terrible
like it's terrible is such a like harsh
like reality on all this stuff man but
let's continue this vlog I don't want to
bring anybody down this is just a major
part of life Zeus has been actually
around it seems like forever I feel like
I've had him forever he's only seven and
we got him as this crazy little puppy
and we hear you buddy
and he said feed him whatever he'll eat
so we're going to make him a big steak
tonight - I'm gonna make him a giant
steak and we're gonna make sure he keeps
eating guys and he's drinking water so
I'm we're going to get a second opinion
I promise you that let's try to change
the speed of the vlog let's try to
change the mood of the vlog Todd was
over here and he was loading his
four-wheeler
and I just he's going to be so method
he's gonna be so mad at me for showing
you this but we caught this on camera
okay so what is your Brittany got
apparently donkeys will play with balls
oh my god is that what it is that things
in their small small angles good not a
bouncy balls like a I don't like tenable
Oh Joe - if I seen that in real life I
was kidding
what do you think this you probably play
with that one so invite the donkey now
calls for flash I'm not kidding he does
that Lauer he'll yeah every time he does
it flash runs to them so now I think
donkey has bonded with flash and now
they're like I'm separate it's crazy
yeah we got off my brother's boy's
birthday tomorrow so we got his stuff
and that should be a lot of fun she's
having all the family together sounds so
good to me right now it's funny degrees
again oh it sucks it's like summer here
today stunning kids are like in short
t-shirts and then some other things no
slip it screwed up toy your needs right
oh no III holder Oh awesome
hope you throw it and then his less cool
yo dude does he poop in the same spot
every day cuz it's only their same time
not good though
I pick it out of the yard I think it's
normal look what we got you look what
would you want to play ready he's not a
dog but that's so cool like I like his
personnel he's got his own like he is
his own character like I don't know I
think that's why I like donkeys there's
your kid on the other side like so much
fun so it's a salt block and apparently
uh they enjoy licking salt you salt
liquor yeah I love this little mohawk
man I need like a little hook or
something oh you need a hook on you
uninstall something for you Sesame Tyler

going to get rose two hours till feeding
times I want assault on rain
what green dude get things put away
we're going to break out before it gets
too dark

action I think the track is dry enough
now to have some fun even if it's wet
it's going to be fun it's ready it's
gonna get a little RC time in before it
gets dark the track is so fun and really
just getting started I did add some
berms a couple Hills in the back a big
burn in the back so good for bonding
with the kids though just hanging out
driving our steeds wrecking them racing

happy not enough time in the day not
enough light to play I know it's bright

my phone while I went online and found I

I thought we could amp up our visual
skills look at this beach and plugged in
your computer on it on the screen so you
can read everything on your TV and buy a
screen recorder Thank You Clark we
imported bugs on bought yet or married
it look that's a stick you're paranoid
dude you're paranoid
Starbucks plan out a box to stand back
can that guys stand back and book it why
it's going so you have something to look
at was lying bedbugs that day I said
like that's a scorpion lock to the super
cool thing about the scope is that you
can plug it into a computer and you can
see what acts
you normally have to look through and
that's one person can see it but this
one apparently you can see on a computer
we're trying to do that sháá hooked that
up and when I say we I mean dales
transfer did you see it yeah look at
that
hold on my dad found like a cobweb with
what there was why don't you give it
easy boy he was talking about like other
people could enjoy it once we get it up
look at that don't you what you guys
nobody agrees the screen okay so this is
a little spider web full of tiny little
I guess they'd be gnat or baby
mosquitoes or Jackson wooly the legs on
does it takes a very little critter
that's the hair on the leg of the bug
there's I okay the only thing I think it
was the last and the object because
there's so much that we could like break
something that last seven years child
proofing my home I'm not gonna have a
window about that frame right there I'm
kidding you have to have some type of
glass oh honey play button the new play

mosquitoes flying out of it nice look at
the green life in it actually that's
chalk the kids were mixing it with chalk
and then wiping it all up we got a
copperhead snake through all the venom
out and then check out the cells in the
venom I'll paste it and tell you what it
tastes like trying to find some life out

mean I'm neuron me but amoebas are
single-celled organisms ooh so this is
whether one self-learning just this
little puddle that we pulled off out of
that wheelbarrow out there is an entire
world to these little creatures look
