welcome to the vlog guys I am not
literally like a zombie right and this
is the zombie version of me that you
feel
I got up to look at this snow
you know when you set your alarm and
you're being responsible and you got
your alarm set but then you wake up at
the wrong time because you didn't set
the volume on your phone that's what I
did today
alarm was going off never heard it so
here we are guys we're running a little
late but it looks like we're gonna be
okay hopefully our flight leaves in 50
minutes we're always late I'm probably
not been late a couple times
today no one I've taken a trip together
it's been playing for a while and it
really excited very excited let's wake
up I am very very out of it it's one
thing to wake up in the morning which
I'm terrible at it's another thing to
pick my camera and vlog it like that's
the hardest part even one thing else
let's do this oh geez oh man I wish we
were going is gonna be warm but it's not
snowed a little bit last night can't
really see it but did
yeah
okay well that did not go as planned our
flight no call no text no email your
flights cancelled that is so crappy and
our next flight we can't get a flight
out to like 5:15 tonight wait flash hey
flash nice to see you again hey Zeus
look I didn't actually leave you don't
have to be mad at me I'm back this is
the worst time for me to leave with you
she has a chiropractor she's gotta get
like broken in half to get fixed her
nerves all pinched she's pregnant she's
sick she's uh no and I had a blast one
of the airport in back that was really
nice
did you know that me and Noah already
went to the airport and we already came
back we did so yeah we're back home good
thing too cause um I made noodles and
potatoes macaroni
No so I want to talk about this real
quick cuz I thought of it on the way
home and leaving the airport I couldn't
help but just want to like say something
negative towards the airline right like
they screw this up
I'm so mad blah blah blah right but how
many times do I fly a year I fly a lot
like I think 70 some flights last year
how many times was I like thanking the
airline for such a good flight never I
never did it I think that the reason I
thought of this is cuz we as people we
do this with everything like it's so
much easier to talk crap when you're mad
then compliment and be thankful for the
good things going on like we always go
to the negative we always go to like I
was just thinking so negative this
morning it made me realize that like we
do this with everything not with not
with the airline like we do this with
everything when when something goes
wrong I don't know how to explain it but
what I'm saying is like it's so much
easier to like talk crap about the
company instead of like complimenting
them on the 70 good flight it's
something to think about like we do it
with a lot of things not just when
something goes wrong but like
it's like your mom and dad won't let you
go do something right you're so mad at
them for that you're so mad at them for
not letting you go but how many times
have they let you go do something or you
didn't even think nothing of it you just
thought that's that's what they're
supposed to do that and I always resort
to the fact that happen for a reason
everything happens for a reason and my
life has been very true if my flight
Whitman canceled I want meat in these
potatoes right now are you ready to stop
like for real like we're leaving this
time I only go on this song hey you take
care of your mommy okay
you too you too big boy the house now
