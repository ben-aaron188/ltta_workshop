welcome to the vlog guys can I ask you
something like a serious question like
I'm dead seriously you got to be honest
with me do my eyebrows look weird are
you serious
are you just doing that to get my
reaction are you serious
Sean no right here and right here really
I thought it was only one what do you do
shaving no okay there's no shame in
doing my thing and I was like oh this is
kind of high up here so I was like just
I went like with electric razor with it
slipped down oh right here oh you
pointed it right out I think we're just
kidding
so it's noticeable some of the one-eyed
bandit now is it's only one it's this
one I love your eyebrow what is up guys
hope you're having an awesome day we are
hanging out the house is a mess the
dishes ain't dumb but we're having fun
yeah what who's that
hey you guys gonna wanna come down here
I got something cool both of you get
your butts down here now I have
something that hang on I mean let me
tripod mount you real quick over the
last couple months we have been talking
about feeding the eel that's how I feed
my eels and we've had to feed him live
crawfish like crawfish for the first
time today my eel ate frozen krill which
is just little square blocks of frozen
krill so my idea and heats it right out
of this thing
like you pinch it and then you just grab
it my idea right now is let's put a
GoPro on here and see if we get some
first-person feel feeding action it'd be
awesome I already know all right let's
go even crazier even crazier check the
side this is the actual GoPro we used in
the flamethrower bit this is if you
missed that bit this way this flame
thing this GoPro was in the fire it's
still recording I'm not kidding the
light is on it's not recording anymore
you need a glove and you need to detach
the top it looks perfect no no I see
some serious heat problems oh my god it
was insane it literally fell into fire
this is the same GoPro we're gonna put
in with the eel now let's see what we
can put this thing through I was so
excited that the footage was on there
but when I saw it still work
I knew it'd be fine alright let's test
it out from tram tram tram tram tram
we're all set up my only worry is that I
fed him four cubes this morning he
hadn't eaten about a month I think they
only eat about once a month anyway my
only actual fear is that was one of my
fears actually I shouldn't play about
that
maile I feel fear is that he's full and
won't eat but I think he will these guys
eat no matter what
this tank is beautiful baby you got a
little algae on there I think it's just
diatoms their normal it's a normal algae
in a new tank so hopefully what a beard
what up guys what up I know you're
beautiful you don't have to show me all
the time this fish right here is the
killer back here behind the s we have
the eel you can kind of see him like
there oh dude I'm sitting there looking
for the e oh he's looking right at me
look yeah see him that's his face right
there he's looking right at your
breathing all right you gonna get some
food dude this stuff stinks so bad
awesome smell Akane just smell it smell
it Tom smell it all right here we go
it's Phoebe II Oh baby I'm excited this
works
seriously it's gonna be so exciting
because I've been wanting to do this
since we got the tank I talked about
feeding eel but every time we fed him it
is really gruesome like to feed him a
live crawfish it's kind of sad I don't
like the feature that so now he's eating
frozen food it should be pretty fun I
did ten bucks ten bucks
it's just cruel it's steeps like a horse
barn dude oh no all right the hard part
is keeping the fish from eating it here
we go we're going in
very good awesome it's like a dream of
mine to have an eel in my house that you
can feed this isn't your house whelming
what it's not his house oh he's happy
now he just ain't so much he's out again
days like I like this I hope that came
out good that was so much fun I can't
believe he ate so well any ate earlier
so guys we have finally successfully fed
the eel and the gopher should make it
fun I hope how much would it take for
you to hand feed the eel just with your
bare hands can you do a bunny hop no all
wheels have to come up to be a bunny hop

things that I've always said is if they
make one of these trucks if they make
one of these trucks with AK long body
you know that hard rubber Kong body just
for dogs imagine this made out of a Kong
you know the things you put peanut
butter in and then you leave it for like

material where he could just chew and
gnaw he destroys this he actually just
ripped it off the truck that's a pretty
