what's up guys today has been completely
opposite of what I thought it was gonna
be I flew into I'm in LA right now I
flew in for am I flew into Los Angeles
today I had all this stuff that I was so
excited to share with you guys and it
turns out I couldn't blog it I just
couldn't vlog it so I called Britney I'm
sitting and I'm calling I'm freaking out
I'm like I'm no vlog today so Britney
filmed a bit so she really is
responsible for saving today I don't
think I would have hardly anything
without her so we're gonna jump to Ohio
I have some excellent huge news about
the skydiving on Saturday the livestream
I'm super excited to you guys about and
we worked it out here in LA and we'll
get to that let's jump to Ohio real
quick check on Brittany and Kane and big
props Brit for saving the day
hope you guys are feeling great let's
get this vlog started it's gonna be
strange it's gonna be Brit and we're
gonna bounce back here I'm gonna tell
you all the good news about the
livestream do you remember this morning
when Daddy left you you were crying new
remember you cried he said bye and you
cried this looks so fun I had to get it
is Caleb gonna join in on this game with
you yep five hours later
the ball is blown up oh you have to kick
it okay I think it's time to wear these
dogs out boshy ready
he literally just woke up
the serious question do you wanna make
some bombs with me some bath bombs yeah
are you trying to get that helmet on
Zeus you're silly
okay so I saw this really cool idea to
make your homemade bath bombs and then
you put these little there like these
little well I'll just show you okay I
figured I would share it for the vlog so
if you guys not home wanna do like a
family time by making these or make them
for your kids or make them for yourself
or whatever
what you need is cupcake pans which I
figure to do minis and regulars citric
acid which I know there's some recipes
that don't use citric acid but the one
that I have does and then you also need
baking soda epson salt cornstarch cream
of tartar coconut oil oils so all the
dry ingredients in a bowl well half a
cup of corn starch 1/2 a cup of Epsom
salt 1 cup baking soda well 1 cup of
baking soda 4 tablespoons of
we're getting nothing in the kitchen
cane stir stir stir stir stir
okay so we're making ours in the mini
cupcake pan
whoa totally just dropped you guys we're
making ours and them in the mini cupcake
cake pans so all you do is pour it in
there and then you have to like pack it
down really tight and I guess you just
let it sit this canes first bath bomb
here's mommy's first math ball okay guys
I hope you enjoyed my part of the vlog
me vlogging for the day I don't ever
feel like I'm that great at it so but I
try and I get it out I get the camera
out for you guys and Romans gone and
show you what we do for the day while
Roman is out doing meetings and all
kinds of everything that he's doing and
I will keep vlogging law Romans out of
town when he leaves on trips and stuff
like that I'll keep vlogging I just want
to make sure you guys like it and yeah
we are going to I'm gonna go feed Kane
get him back then ready for bed and I'll
see you guys tomorrow bye still got my
cast on and use this little coffee maker
for a tripod honey I forgot my tripod
it's not that I'm bad who needs a tripod
welcome back to LA I am super super
excited I've been crunching on this you
guys know this livestream Saturday which
is if you're watching this when I
uploaded tomorrow is my skydive Brittany
and I are skydiving now the whole idea
here was that we do it live we were
gonna do it live with our phones well
I've got me you guys know I talk about
all the time and then everything went
crazy and they said it was gonna be
about 40 to 45 thousand dollars to film
it and I and you guys said don't do it
this is crazy it's not worth it and I
agree with you guys it's absolutely
insane we have been crunching numbers I
flew to LA we worked on this stuff today
plus a whole bunch of other stuff here's
what it boils down to you guys hear me
out a couple days ago I got very serious
with you guys and I shared all of this
with you I talked about the budget I
talked about forty to forty five
thousand dollars to livestream I shared
with you guys they
that I don't normally share and that is
what it cost to do certain things in the
business I'm in it's very expensive
people charge a lot I'm gonna try to
make this short and entertaining for you
guys I um
I already knew it was expensive I told
you guys on Twitter days and days before
they said it was gonna be 40 grand that
there's gonna be about $20,000 and
here's the thing we got it back down to
about $20,000 it's actually a little
more right now it's at 25 understand
we're trying to get a hair lower $25,000
to live show now the only reason I'm
sharing this with you guys is because it
is a part of my life and what I do
although it is a ton of money this is
more money I used to work full time in a
factory all year for $25,000 a year so I
fully understand what this is and this
is insane this is crazy but that's what
it costs it is what it costs it's
$10,000 alone just to turn us they're
turning guys they're turning for us for
you they're gonna shift an entire
satellite point it at our dive location
and we're gonna have full Wi-Fi like t3
Wi-Fi it's very expensive and I would
not be sharing this with you guys if I
didn't try to convince you that this is
really what it costs and I really really
want to do it entertainment is expensive
and I'm doing it for us it is gonna be
once-in-a-lifetime where you're gonna do
the livestream not only that they're
telling me this time we have multiple
cameras like live you guys are gonna be
watching a skydive live Saturday
different camera angles so it's gonna go
from Brittany's face jumping out of this
plane to my face to the ground to that
like all this fancy stuff I know this is
a lot of stuff we will also be vlogging
the entire thing but if you wanna watch
it first join me live watch it live with
a Saturday we are going to jump we're
gonna jump at 3:00 p.m. Eastern that's
12 o'clock if you're in California 3
p.m. Eastern is supposedly the jump time
I'm guessing I'll I'm guessing I'll
start live streaming much before that
maybe 2 p.m. even 1 p.m. I'm gonna do a
long life in probably hours I'll be on
there

like normally I had such a fun day
planned I was like we're going to LA I'm

dude completely opposite of that it was
completely obviously I was sitting in
this meeting and I'm like I'm texting
Brad's like you got a vlog today you got
to get the camera out and play with Kane

whatever she sent me I haven't seen
obviously it's been in the blog but I
haven't seen it yet I hope you guys are
feeling great man I hope you're doing
good keep pushing forward I can't stress
this enough
use my channel used me as an example of
motivation guys there was never in a
billion years somebody came to me and
said one day you're gonna spend twenty
five thousand dollars just to jump out
of a plane for viewers I would have
slapped I would have never believed it
ever but what I can say is I never
stopped trying to do things I never
stopped pushing for it I never stopped
evolving as a person I never stopped
becoming the better person I never I
never went backwards I've always tried
to be better man if you look at where my
YouTube started
dude I was rough my content was bad it
was it was it was foul it was it was
I've changed as a person and people tell
me I've changed and it is truly for the
better man I truly love Who I am now and
I work every day so that tomorrow I'm
even better than I am today so I
encourage you guys to do the same thing
don't go backwards become the better
version of who you are right now it is
very important so anyway guys I hope
