right here's my next project I don't
hopefully I have the parts I got whole
bag of parts for this guy if you guys
don't remember I completely trashed this
car holy crap that's so fast
oh the wheels go I think we're still
good no you're not good at all you're
not good at all oh yeah yeah hit the
wall I mean I blew the back wheel off I
smashed the wall it's got holes in it
he's gonna be busy for a while so my
goal today is to put it back together I
really want to put it back together and
the reason I want to put back together
is because now I have giant ramps to hit
yeah look at this pin oh my gosh they're
not supposed to look like that they're
supposed to look like they're supposed
to look like this to be perfectly honest
man what I did to this car is not that
much was broken this is bent this piece
has been bent down the shot suspension
is snapped that baby's hosed
this is snaps right here broke the
aluminum straight off right there it's
not that bad for what we did you
remember hitting that walking hey series
what we got I skip past a lot of this
cuz I know it's boring to just repair an
RC on the vlog but look at all my parts
I mean literally have everything that I
could ever need for this car every piece
of plastic from this car actually has a
lip on the front which actually did the
stuff without the lip because during
rehearsal before I was filming I wrecked
and broke that thing in half so maybe
I'll put the new one on this bed and a
dead 210
and see if this works do it all right
guys here goes nothing
I have completely redone the entire back
end this is all brand new everything
back here
yes steering no joke does over a hundred
miles per hour not a hundred miles per
hour for an hour seat a hundred miles
per hour for real like you get in a car
you go 100 miles per hour
get back dude it is back call that
ticking noise I won't worry about that
what seemed like a few seconds took me
two solid hours took me two hours which
I'm proud to say I've rebuilt the car
like legit do you guys know anything
about me I suck at that kind of stuff so
I'm proud of this I'm doing better I fix
the pinball machine this week my RC car
I clean the garage
good I'm doing good yeah I'll say two
things in a row
dude I got to be completely honest with
you guys now I just spent all that time
fixing it I don't necessarily want to
rap it's almost impossible for me to
show you how fast this car is so I'm
just gonna do a little Drive real quick
what you keep in mind there is no this
is not fast forward this is real flat
this you crazy something happened it
just stopped super super hot all the
wires are hot I'm sure this has nothing
to do with me touching this thing okay
