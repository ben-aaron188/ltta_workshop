you guys so so much for coming out okay
you like it since we have the bike racks
tonight is it possible when he's
recorded no pressure since we have the
bike racks is it safe for us like for
them out there that we go out and maybe
take pics with the people in the front
or say high fives or I don't think we
have enough security staff home the bike
rack doing you think they'll get pushed
if it's unsafe we don't do it if they
push the bar and over is definite unsafe
situation
yeah that's true there's no way to tell
them before like look they're going to
come out just the wave bush and we think
the best situation is why you are so low
