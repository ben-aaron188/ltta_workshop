out here we have to convince the whole
family we're we're not leaving without
mom and dad and brother they'd all have
to come it would be a big giant trip
alright we got about an hour and a half
ride to the airport which should be a
beautiful view and then we're off maybe
two flights today alright let me ask you
guys a serious question alright and take
me seriously listen would you be would
you be mad at your puppy if when he
pooped in your house he could make
little sculptures out of it like what if
you went out and it was shaped like a
little duck would you still be mad is
that the dumbest question you've ever
been asked my god this way
so yesterday when we were at the tricks
in story they didn't have this shirt and
cane size but they did have a girl's
shirt on that size so keen is wearing a
girl shirt you can tell by the sleeves
you know we told him straight up all
right dude here's the I've never seen
one of these out in real public so give
me five dude that's awesome I saw you
coming I looked at it probably ten times

going back for it we just saw this guy
drop luggage he's going back for it good

Ohio
tough decision although our flight is
boarding we almost forgot our Utah
magnet because we have never been here
you would find a cupcake on dude I'm
digging the bear I'm in the tree
although we saw a moose here but that it
would remind us of the moose that jumped
in front of our car and a bear fell one
for downstairs okay next stop is
Michigan

I'm gonna fly the plane I'm like they
don't know Cain just land it in Michigan

lo8 I had a good idea you know it's cool
I always come through this tunnel in the
vlogs when I'm traveling by myself you

Kane with me in this tunnel feels an
awesome walk through here with you guys
you should walk well buddy imagine being
on a skateboard on this look who's in
the airport

35 minutes later cuz the quickest flight
I've ever been I've done that flight
before the shortest flight I remember
was LA to San Diego that was really
quick but maybe that was quicker you're
a genius I think you're some kind of
mastermind what is that

home we are home good to you got it
I think car seats are so if you're a
parent if you're a parent and you cannot
wait to get your kids out of car seats
they are the worst best safety thing
ever it's the person foot car seats in
