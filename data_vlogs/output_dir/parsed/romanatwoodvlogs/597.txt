guys welcome to the vlog welcome to our
extremely messy house thumbs up to the
viewers hey what's up today is a huge
freaking day man I don't even know how
to explain today's the day we finally
get to reveal to you our new aquarium
this is something we've been waiting for
actually it's been months since I first
talked about the hole in the wall and
what was gonna be there so today is
finally the day that we get to show you
our butts you ready go see the tank huh
why are you getting so big so fast
you're growing rapidly so I honestly was
gonna get like a cover I was gonna make
this vlog all about the reveal of this
tank and I just figured well first of
all I didn't get the covers that blew
that out but I want to see you guys
waited forever to see this tank chances
are you've already seen it on Animal
Planet last night and if you did it here
it is our brand new custom smile more
aquarium here we go guys like I couldn't
be more excited to show this really is a
dream come true to me
here's the tag
waited so long to show you this it's
finally here it's absolutely beautiful
comes my favorite fish in the entire
world guys the clown trigger sorry to
see him he's coming to help
here's the heels back there this is
where they all that's how I like that
they came from he hides right s is
always back and wraps himself around the
s gives his body right thinner
so guys here is I hope you guys enjoyed
as much as I do it is absolutely insane
is breathtaking is more than I could
have ever imagined having one story
short it just really is a dream come
true to have this tank man especially
custom-built with art with our company
logo on it it's just too much man I'm
beside myself I'll try to give you the
shortest version forgive me I am
shooting on a fisheye lens because it's
the only way to show the whole smile
more logo on the screen because the I'll
explain that later
basically years and years and years ago
before I had much of anything you know
before YouTube I loved saltwater
aquariums and I would collect from fish
tank Todd you guys know Todd from the
vlogs I would go and I would hustle he
had like these these $10 pieces of coral
and they were little pieces of coral and
I just I wanted it so bad and I would
just hustle 10 bucks at a time he's
little cause it's all I could get and
even that was like I shouldn't be buying
this I shouldn't be using this money to
buy a little coral so basically I had
this little little aquarium in my old
house and I would just add these little
corals as I would come up with a little
money here and there as years went by
and as my youtube channel started to
grow a little bit I reached out to
Animal Planet and I was like yo I'm this
youtuber with and I didn't have like
anything that a TV show would be like oh
yeah we need a bellman tank I didn't
have any big numbers I was just like I
wanted a tank so that built for me so I
sent this email
nothing ever happens in fact I did get
an email back but it was like it was
like an automated like we will forward
this to the I don't know I don't know
where it went and the guys from tanks
and nobody ever saw the email so they
didn't even know I sent the email years
later now this year Animal Planet
reaches out to me and asks if they can
build me an aquarium it's just like an
impossible story to me and I really
can't explain to you how crazy it all
worked and how crazy it all was it's
like the whole it really is like the law
of attraction man it really works that
way and I'm telling you this tank is
surreal to me it really is a dream come
true so thank you guys for being here
thanks for being so patient and thanks
for dealing with this crazy fish I'm
gonna go to my vlog camera now this is
what I was explaining about you can't
get the logo in the shot you see how the
creases are right here so it always
pushes a letter wonder
you can never see the logo no matter how
far back you go you can never see the
logo it's also hard to see the size of
the tank unless somebody's really
standing beside it he's trying to kiss
you
I don't think you guys know how good it
feels to just be able to film in the
store without hiding like I can only
shoot this direction for the last month
it's like walking around I have to watch
reflections you guys would catch
reflections and though it was crazy this
is the craziest thing it is absolutely
beautiful here man we were running out
getting a couple supplies and things we
need for tomorrow you know what's so
crazy is by the time I'm filming this
like right now the tank episode hasn't
even aired yet it's still like two hours
away so I haven't even got to see the
show but I've already seen in tweets and
you guys live in different parts of the
world where you can't even watch the
show or in the UK it doesn't come out
for like another like week or so two
weeks or something until the 13th or so
yeah so Animal Planet sent me a quick
like two three-minute clip of the show

her laptop and we can watch it yeah hey
flash what's up dude you know it's crazy
we've actually had cable TV since we
like literally had the Internet it came
with it like a package but we've never
hooked it up that means like two years
worth of cable we've never hooked up is
that pee or water what is that I don't
think it's if you gotta use the restroom
you gotta go in the bathroom I'm not on
the floor all right guys so here's what
we're gonna do tonight we got 13 minutes
until our show comes on we were gonna
get here's a quick story
so King got his new BMX bikes as you
guys know if you watch the vlogs huh
Zeus got his new body for his big RC
truck so looking at BMX bikes for Kane
made me think hey I kind of want a new
BMX bike - so you're not even gonna
believe this there's a frog so we're
looking at new bikes and you guys know
there's hundreds of bikes there's so
many bikes that I could have gotten but
they happened to make Kane's exact bite
in my size I wish so bad you could have
seen Kane's face when I showed him that
I could get the same bike he has so now
we're gonna match we're gonna match at
the BMX park aren't we nice glasses dude
you are you are you trying to each try
to tough-talking for a hug don't want
some no it's not that bad just dragging
it Zeus you ready for the fourth my man
you ready to rock he likes him I think
it's a new look for Zeus I know you're
talking now you got it
I like oh he has no care whatsoever all
he cares about shoeing on that ball
guys I can't even like we're watching
tank right who remembers vlogs long time
ago you guys could probably find them I
don't remember where they're at but it's
Brittany and we literally just sit and
watch tanked and we watched every
episode of tanked all the time there's a
vlog of you saying I want these guys in
my house I wonder if there is any ways
dude I'm like got a little bit of chills
tonight that I'm sitting here watching
tanked and it's because we're on it it's
a real man I'm telling you guys it's
crazy
Caine's trying to open my bike I know
you getting it with a fork
no wonder you had your back turn Chucky
turning around I say about this house
right now and Kane single-handedly open
this but I did not help him not even for
one second you did it with a fork
chuckles this DMX father-son dude how
cool is it of a company to even make a
bike that matches I love it all right
gain the house is trashed but the bikes
are built we are ready to jam dude I
only have one complaint about the
tire bike and that is not so much on
mine but on Kings by the seat
I understand BMX bikes you really don't
use this seats but as a kid you do use
the seats we ended up putting we had an
old Hot Wheels bike we ended up putting
the seat on it because it's so it sits
like this so you can't sit on it you
just can't sit on it even mine it's
pretty painful but you know it's not
really designed to sit on he's just kind
of learning how to stand up and ride
anyway so it's all good and a lot of you
guys said you need to put his handlebars
level with your Forks like I ride but
the bike isn't here too big so they need
to come back so that he can reach but
he's killing he's doing so good on him
so I'm so happy with it alright buddy
hey you know how you tore all this open
now you get to put it all away you just
you that's what's mommy doing you baking
that cake good night my man man I love
you no way there is no way you could
love me more
there's no way guess what chicken boy
all my work done so we can wake up and
ride bikes okay say good night now that
Cain's in bed I'm gonna come out and
surprise so he knows I got him cakes he
already seen these he want someone
so bad ever since I did that video where
I'm hopping on my back pegs that's all
he wants to learn how to do like it's
all he talks about with his bike so when
he wakes up in the morning he's gonna
have pegs it was so fun tonight to watch
