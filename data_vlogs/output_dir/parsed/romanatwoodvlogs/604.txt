hey guys welcome to the vlog already a
super really interesting morning we are
out of gas the truck is when it's out of
gas you gotta get to the gas station to
eat gas really quickly it's thirsty huh
here's why the mornings already
interesting we get to one gas station
while she's pumping as soon as she
starts power goes out little gas station
will power everything out so weird I've
never ever in my life seen now our
actual main goal right now to get Kane
into his ear appointment to see if all
this sand and all this stuff is out of
his ear it's been it's been crazy dude
least he's not sticking stuff in his
ears like other like I've seen kids like
stick corn and peas and like food down
in there and it's stuck don't get any
ideas when Noah was little he stuck out
he was piece of corn up in his know so
far the head didn't get you to go to the
doctor yeah is it working
come on break it put your fist through
it Brett party ten minutes late so we're
in a hurry
ah anybody else notice when you're in a
hurry everybody drives extra slow yeah
or when you're in a hurry you drive
extra fast making it look like
everyone's driving slow all day hunting
for you baby day hunting are you gonna
purposely hit every red light you got
gasps no stop didn't pulled it out and
it was like gasps I'm just like we're
hitting like every speed bump today we
need a little extra boost of positivity
I can see it I can sense it
and I walk in that gas station we were
too sad she's like you better take
shelter we're about to get the craziest
storm in seven years we haven't had a
storm like this in seven years I'm like
I just worked on a gas station you can't
see if a boat I brought two batteries
and both of them are flashing red I did
bring my charge I'll plug it in at the
doctor's office but what Wow Wow what is
going on we're gonna have a great day
you guys are gonna have a great be
perfect everything when you're in a
hurry this is your ultimate enemy right
here trash trucks and red lights hang in

to make stops all right guys we have
made it to the office oh it's my chair
charge up what do you mean it's Doc's

let's get it done man you're getting as
big as mommy look at that
that's scary look like it did good job
little buddy we are out of there so kind
of good news and bad news his ears not
fixed little ear infection so the ones
cleared up and then ones not cleared up
which is trying one more time to clear
it up if not they want to put him under
and put tubes in his ears which I'm not
a fan of I'm not a fan of putting
especially putting him under you have to
go to sleep for that I actually had
tubes when I was little so there's a
good chance that he has my genetics that
sucks
he's got the cowlick he may need the
tubes I thought the cowlick was gonna be
enough punishment man I really did oh
he's got him cornered hit him with the
right it all
Oh oh you better run you and shovel now
oh he's got a speed Oh easy Zeus watch
the right hook watch the right hook and
get you every time
BAM so I wasn't gonna do this at all in
the vlog I get all I was gonna do it off
Cameron then just show you guys the
final piece but then I thought why are
you guys are youtubers a lot of you are
trying to be vloggers a lot of you may
this may actually interest some of you
so let's start from scratch let me
explain to you at what I'm doing first
of all you guys know I travel a lot I
have to travel a lot and I'm about to go
on tour it's a pretty big towards like a
20 city tour where I need equipment and
I learn from vacation with the family
that I did not have everything I needed
to make the greatest vlogs I could I was
always shy a piece where my brother had
it had to borrow from my brother so
today I am gonna attempt to build the
ultimate survival kit for a vlogger
that's cool right survival vlogger kit
you wouldn't want me to flash of bath
vlogger survival kit what and you guys
can help me out on this this isn't
something that I've perfected or this
isn't something that I'm like good at I
want to create a survival kit so here's
what I got
this is a check on case this you're
allowed to carry on a plane this is the
proper dimensions to carry onto a plane
this is a checkbox which means it has to
go under the plane so there's two cases
one holds a lot more but a lot of you
guys and me when you get on a plane
sometimes you don't want to put your
valuable equipment your laptop and stuff
under the plane so you want to pack it
into one case here's the hard part
this is pluck foam pluck foam so that
means you only got one attempt to cut
out the exact mold that you want let's
start with this one
yeah you give in flush a bad hey little
man hey little chicken man
Noah you're building a survival kit as a
vlogger as a filmer you have one item to
put in this box right away what's the
first item you want came back a blog
camera good idea I'm gonna go and say
vlog camera two you should always travel
with to vlog camp I know I'm adding to
it that's okay you're not wrong here
you're not wrong too full of cameras at
all time in that and in my opinion is
two plus the one you have it's always a
backup you never know before I get too
deep into this I want to explain to you
how this all came about as a youtuber we
get paid by our views the ads however
where there's no there's no real
algorithm that shows you what you're
getting paid you get paid differently
every month but here's what happens as
youtubers we don't have a lot of
write-offs
as a business owner you need write offs
otherwise you're gonna pay it all in
taxes I know this is kind of complicated
if you're young but as you get older and
you start a business you need write-offs
tax exemptions that is right so the
reason this project all came about is my
accountant said Roman you need more
riders so I started thinking about what
I could write off and blonde it's always
like travels my biggest write off but
he's like can't you buy any more
equipment and I'm like okay I've got an
idea
brings me to my second point if you guys
are trying to start a business you're
you know you you want to take that step
start the business get in LLC that
allows you to write off things when I
buy this camera I'm allowed to write
that off in taxes it saves me a lot of
money in the end so it's really
interesting it's really you know I'm at
explaining why don't you open these pull
out the pieces and let's figure out how
we're gonna cut this foam out and again
guys I was gonna do this all off-camera
and just show you hey check out my
survival box but I don't know this this
may actually interest you guys in this
is the extreme version of this you can
obviously throw all your crap in a bag
or you don't need three cameras this is
like the ultimate survival box
k-much foot once you put Zeus in the
bathtub - I have developed kind of
pretty heavy OCD so everything needs to
be symmetrical and I feel like if I
plucked the wrong foam it's just gonna
throw me off like if one cameras here
and then one cameras here it's just
gonna be weird I'm gonna add to this
GoPros GoPros got to have a GoPro girl
crows are great for not only underwater
but time lapses and other things so
let's add I'm gonna say two GoPros now I
bought two brand-new GoPros just for
this box but I gave one of them away in
my livestream so now I only have one I
do however have a lot of old GoPros that
i season my prank videos all the time so
I'm just gonna use one of those oh you
got into No this right here is my
original GoPro case with all of my prank
GoPros and I've said this in the past no
girl has never ever sent me a single
item I've actually bought in every
single camera including my vlog cameras
in gophers nobody's ever sponsored me
with any of this stuff so this is my own
collection that I have collected over
the years and I actually have a ton of
broken ones too these are the ones that
actually work Lacey's clan he's like oh
you're clean don't touch me so basically
the way this works is you pluck the foam
out and you design your case and once
you've plucked it that's it there's
really no going backwards hey buddy if
you could put anything in this case for
vlogging what would you put you getting
it I cannot imagine what he's grabbing
her
this for my case I don't know it kind of
takes up a lot of space dude well we'll
see if we can make him fit all right so
here's my guest this really isn't that
interesting to a lot of people so I'm
gonna skip ahead a little bit I'm gonna
I'm gonna keep design and cutting this
thing out and just see what I come out
with here I'm already stuck because I
don't know do I do I do it with the
bottom on do I do it with it off do I
make a do I make a jump a junk hole
where I just throw stuff that's I'm
confused hey buddy I need a I need some
expert advice here I figure you're the
guy I am building let me show you here I
am building the ultimate vlogger
survival kit this is like everything you
need as a daily vlogger now obviously
your more extreme than I am but I just I
want one piece give me one piece you
have to have in your case I got it okay
all right I got one I'm gonna add it in
all right thanks buddy
all right actually my case of all mounts
tripod stands GoPro accessories you name
it it's all here we've got choices
medium large and and small this is like
GoPro this is like DSLR and this is
probably vlog camera we're gonna go with
that one Casey's edition was the little
Joby tripod so we're gonna add that in
somewhere around here okay so Dale just
stopped by what would you add to my
survival kit alright I would add GoPro
to tripod adapters because you can't
find them anywhere like in store that's
true and there are extra USB cables and
not even necessarily the ones you have
but like the old style when we're on
vacation that's the one we didn't have a
yeah
some didn't have it it's a lots of
cables for USB cables adapters got it
got it okay cool I'm gonna get
everyone's advice on this thing all
right guys Dale says cables lots of
cables USB cables chargers perfect - I
probably forgot cable I need something
to put them in like a little box so I
can cut a hole out with them I'd be good
idea I want you guys to weigh in on this
- because I there's no way I'm gonna get
this done today this is not gonna happen
I'm gonna eat up my whole day trying to
design this box so tell me in the
comments what would you add to the box
what's up dude hey I got a question for
you I am building the ultimate survival
kit for a vlogger my question to you
what is one piece of vlogging equipment
that you can't live without if you were
traveling what would it be
nope doesn't count battery holder hi
buddy it's been nice talking to you like
a man dude I can't even physically
lifted the SLR I think I can fit one I
think I'll have room okay good
suggestion buddy it's all for tour dude
don't be on Romans hop cases calm all
right thanks buddy I'll talk soon I'm
gonna smash this guy on tour I can't
wait
my little pop-tart ninja Wow
so boots he says DSLR now here's the
deal I have never blogged with the DSLR
I'm still the old fashion blogger that
runs around
with my little camera but I will say for
traveling DSLRs are pretty awesome for
more than just vlogging they're great
for photos there's no I'm pretty picky
with photos I like a good photo so this
could be a nice addition pull it pull it
pull it you got it don't wiggle wiggle

break and ride some bikes yeah come on
