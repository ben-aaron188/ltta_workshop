all right little lady which one so many
options oh look at this guy you guys
want to know exactly why there's no
paintings on our wall and there's no
curtains on our windows and we barely
have blinds covering it's because
there's too many options how do you pick
I'm not an interior decorator I have no
idea how to do this stuff I get it it's
great to have the choices but also makes
it difficult when you don't know what
you're doing you like that one it's
called camel can't you like the camel

some curtains hopefully I got speaking
behind you so I just don't really bad
news really bad news when I peel this
tape off the paint comes off
I'm really bad look okay so here's the
original holes here's where I tried to
fix it and this is from the last face
I'm just destroying the house oh you
know what I think that's gonna buff out
real nice
we've had our seat crashes there's so
much damage to these walls I think it's
yeah Hardware enclosed looks promising
looks pretty basic here now I can see
they sent drywall this is what I was
lacking oh really laughs this is what I
was lacking before these little dry wall
studs that you pre put in all right guys
she's all up I just worked right past
the pain I know it looks pretty decent
just don't look too close it's destroyed
we definitely have to have someone come
fix all this stuff look at this the weld
on the mount broke while I was trying to
do it
this screw got stuck couldn't get it out
it's a disaster
oh my gosh so cranky that's the old one
yeah it was good it looks really good
good job I feel like if each year that
was my album and each blog was my song
today's would be like the curtain rod or
curtains or to be perfectly honest with
you guys and this is something I'm
saying I wouldn't normally ever put
something like this in a vlog but to be
honest with you guys I've been so stuck
mentally in this like I'm gonna be
honest with you I think a lot that I
have to entertain you guys and I have to
you know I have to do something exciting
for you guys but like this curtain rod
thing this is this like real that's real
like I was gonna do that on camera or
off camera like that stuff is real but
mentally like the more I keep telling
Brett like oh I'm gonna try to film a
lot more today make the vlogs longer
it actually is making the vlog shorter
because my whole mindset is like trying
to do something for you guys instead of
just filming my day so I need to ask for
a little forgiveness on the short vlogs
I'm not even happy with the length of my
last couple of blogs and this washer I
think it all comes from the fast pace
like being on the tour and with the
movie come out and it's like mentally
it's putting me in this light I got to
entertain I get entertain instead of
just showing you guys my life and what
it's really like here at the house in
the store and and and I gotta get back
into that so forgive me a little bit I
really want to get back to that I don't
even really want to put that in the vlog
but I'm telling you exactly how I'm
feeling like I am trying too hard to be
creative instead of just showing you
guys my day so I'll get back into it I
will I will I just yeah I got a really
selling there's no time to settle in
like I'm only here for another week I
love you thank you guys for everything
