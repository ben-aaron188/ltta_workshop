hey hey guys just like that the basement
is loaded everything smile more now it
just needs folding it in pack and then
shelf look at ourselves they're hurting
so bad
so last night I put play in front of
work and it forced me to work this
morning so come on Zeus get your ball
hope you guys are having an awesome day
let's get rolling come on buddy oh you
used to climb these steps so fast hey
guys hey hey
we don't we don't know who shipped all
this to us but it was in a random box in
our merch I don't even understand how we
got it but thank you whoever sent it
there's no note nothing it was an Amazon
box Kane has been digging through it all
morning I love you guys I got to go love
you I love you me love you I got to take
a second thank you guys seriously on a
personal level thank you for for
sticking around through not just the
exciting box but the boring vlogs like
though we're getting I happen to rent a
truck and going to pick up merch and
just thank you for for hanging out
through even those days I still consider
myself more of a creator than a vlogger
so I'm always trying to create something
cooler for the vlog but on some days
it's not an option like it is not an
option whether it be family time or it
be business time sometimes vlogs just
aren't that exciting so I love seeing
that you guys stick around even through
those days and to be honest with you
most of you guys are right you guys
always say it's a vlog film your life
that's what you're gonna want to
remember that's what you're gonna want
to watch when you're older and you're
absolutely right it is like I want to
see us picking up this merch in the
future be like man you remember when we
used to do that or you know we're
shipping all our orders out of our
basement like I know that's gonna become
a crazy memory at some point so thank
you guys so much it truly means the
world to us my family it's so cool you
guys are here on this journey with us
and love the fun things are always about
to happen but they're always about
nothing's here right now so let's just
continue our day dropping this truck off
going to get Noah from school and then
who knows
well I've successfully driven a 28 foot
truck feel pretty good yes sir
that truck is like driving a bucket down
the set of stairs with dishes in it that
truck is like rolling down the side of a
mountain in a box made out of Legos it's
like driving a jackhammer
down the street but it's a truck it's a
truck it's supposed to have stiff
suspension to hold all the extra weight
you put in it if I had soft suspension
it would just sink down I know I know a
thing or two about cars guys it's kind
of my we're gonna go in and grab some
snacks you don't need them but we want
them what happened tough tough decisions
