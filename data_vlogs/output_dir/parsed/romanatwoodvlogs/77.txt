gotta go inside and switch paperwork I'm
down they'll blow away like kites dude I
didn't bark up tight yeah here we are
guys hope you're having an awesome day
we are starting out with a little idea
that we've uh I don't know who came up
with the whole kayak idea as a chase Oh
what is it you utica I'm the guy I will
pay up for the kayaks it was a lot more
than this I deal with these tanks that
we're gonna attempt maybe today
hopefully today the weather's beautiful
it's perfect I know you don't under
catch you later what up big dog what's
up big dog a flashy man you're looking
that bucket looking that bucket right
there Oh beau Korres taking a nap
hi girl what's up little little little
worm
she's an inchworm oh she's sleepy okay
did you even see I'm home how you feel
good
hell is here hey let me up me up my back
my back my back I'm just kidding I just
want a free router so you guys wanna go
get Marty yeah hey you don't that thing
and hang out that's it there we go here
we go let's go get mutt guys you can't
even see the rat on the buggy only the
splatter doesn't even look like it's
right unreal so dirty oh you got to get
it dirty man look at this cute little
baby over here
this is the spot can you clear it all
them thorns out put the hatchet he's got
gloves cane drop all these thorns out
for me right here chop all those my boot
ja ja ja okay so here's the thing about
this idea I'm not liking right now it's
getting very cold out we're losing
sunlight as you can see it took us a
while to get down here and britni's
bringing the winch over right now we're
gonna hook it to this tree or just the
back of the quad and we're gonna attempt
to kayak down this river and then the
winch is gonna pull us back if you can
just pull in right where no is that and
just straighten it out girl yeah that's
fine well it looks like it's me and you
dude we got these babies river ready
river ready to go we're just gonna jump
in and see what happens obviously you
don't want to go in the water cuz it's
freezing but I'm sure if we do it'd be
funny for you guys if not I think what's
gonna happen is you're gonna start to
pull and you're gonna turn it's gonna
just toss you over going in now just
like yeah if you know it'd been nice
knowing you
nice well we might as well just run it
now oh my gosh pull you backwards I say
the idea is Brian gets all the way to
the end and then we fire up the winch
and pull him back that's a lot you can't
even see Brian but he's all the way at
the very corner hopefully can dodge all
these branches so this thing has a motor
on it and does that rope superfast yeah
like so fast eat it it's a dance move
look at that dance move
so we got one little obstacle that's
this tree down here in this water we're
gonna try to just pull it out toss them
overboard
clink Wow
Brian you're supposed to catch it hi is
it tree going to come out
I mean you broke it keep going yeah
there's just enough time to jump in here
and try this if it was only just early
and we had so much more sunshine what
are you waiting on they like this water
right here is deeper than this pole I
don't know if you can see deeper than
mine
normally I would fall for comedy I don't
want to fall
okay we're going one more it's getting
dark out our lighting sucks our cameras
probably look like crap but it's way too
fun and I don't know what honestly we
captured so how will happen so fast I
wasn't expecting that much power I never
moved like that in a kayak
there we go guys
it's still winter summer is gonna be on
a whole nother style for us I can't wait
good stuff you had one one job to get
the winch up safely she's fun she's fun
we were whipping it pretty hard all
right let's roll oh my god let's go boys
well we blew it up boys she's blown up
oh man
it's just affirmation we're fine ready
here we go you know
go get my favorite shoes off baby I'm so
dirty though yeah yeah yeah here there's
