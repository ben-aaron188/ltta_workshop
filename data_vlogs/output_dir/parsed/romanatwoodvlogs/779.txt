gonna be rush like , hang out bring the
family bring the kids bring a toy it's a
giant toy drive we want to make this the
biggest toy drive this town has ever
seen and it's gonna be amazing for 10:00

December 19th it's Saturday it's coming
up pretty quick I want to see everybody

canes got his monkey and handcuffs
that's his favorite thing from the mail
yesterday all right I won't look
you shut the door big boy oh I got it no
worries mama wasn't waiting for nobody
she just jumped in here
what's up Doug mr. stepping on Britt's
toes that's all good
Ida put the straw in front of the camera
for you
all right that's a good one Justin ears
I think we should show you like the
vanilla ice cream you know you don't
like it try it it's been a lie scream
it's a big scoop of vanilla ice cream I
missed him I missed him trying it's a
scoop of sour cream yeah I love sour
cream but it looks like a scoop ice that
good really tricky I was tricked you
with the ice cream huh that's a good
trick a soup of scent we just learned
that tonight a scoop of sour cream looks
like a scoop of ice cream you can serve
that it we can serve that at dinner
almost got a go party he's tickling my
chiny chopper go watch that chain
chopper guys let's go bril we got the
crew tonight well you got them like you
guys you know look at that purse she
hits you with that it's over game over
man I feel safe
you guys really want to do this let's
get her
she's stealing so we've came in for a
dishwasher and is there really a TV on
that is that an advertisement it's
pretty believable all these new
dishwashers look different than the old
ones you just throw it what the heck
what is that
OS we put the silverware yeah I feel
like exhibit came and pimped this one
out y'all we put TVs in your wash
alright guys so the typical I think
normal thing to do would be measure your
dishwasher before you go to the store we
didn't you better hope I don't know what
they put in that Mexican food but you
are lit wait we might oh my gosh you
know no one saw that yeah only a million
people saw that tomorrow today so the
real question is are they all the same
size they do look like it
I mean hey a whole look exactly the same
how do you pick
oh that's cool I could just see Kane
smashing his head on this handle every
day that's that's kid brew
Kane and I are breaking away from the
whim and the ladies where should we go
we're free to roam that's a big roll of
carpet that's what you put in your house
look your samples take a woman see if it
matches hey I was gonna have Kane
getting a dryer and scare you but then I
realized how bad of an idea I can just
see the security tape Roman Atwood
it's a sponge dryer you imagine yeah we
don't we don't this is exactly what we
have for the trash can up broke that's
smaller ways look what's the right size
for you I'm gonna have inches or eight
and a half inches well she ain't messing
around I don't know if you guys do this
but our trash can thing broke probably
what six months ago my ABS already sore
from boxing box she did this boxing
class today so we just actually found
the actual one well it's not the same
but it held two what if our trash cans
don't fit that comes with them perfect
gonna have to call my brother
Lenny got him okay we just got to get
black tubs for the store and we're out
of here do you have to order everything
no dishwashers are in stock of course
see how many stores I've been into
lately where they say we have to order
that I feel like the internet is just to
follow there's any more of these
