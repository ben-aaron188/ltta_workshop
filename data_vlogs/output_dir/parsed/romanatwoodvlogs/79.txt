this crazy winch like they use it for
like snowboarding wakeboarding anything
you want to pull across a long distance
it's got a throttle it's got it is
amazing we're super excited to get it
obviously it's something that I wanted
in the winter time but it took about two
months about tomorrow it's been over a
month we ordered this thing a long time
ago they had to custom build it and like
but we weren't waiting a long time so we
missed the snow
maybe it'll snow again but we've got mud
and the pond is the dog now it's very
cold but we gotta test this thing out
like we can't open it today not test it
you gotta at least try it make sure
everything's good yeah and when I say we
I mean you hope you're having a great
day Brittany and Cora are sleeping the
kids plan on the trampoline and we're
kind of just getting started we're
dodging rain right now if the rain hits
it's gonna mess up our plans if the rain
doesn't hit maybe we'll have some fun
today with this thing if not either way
we got some big plans with this it's
gonna be fun it's gonna it's it's
probably not good on my back but we got
it we gotta test this thing up so you're
saying if it rains I don't have to go in
the park I mean if you're gonna get wet
go to your wet make me fun like doing it
the rain
I mean electronics and engines
that stopped us before right

pickup spot dude are you sure that your
hundred percent ain't nobody that is
empty

probably even even more Coley no way

oh boy all right I think you're making
everyone sick I think you're making
everyone sick say goodbye for now say
good blury for now so you're just gonna
take no you won't get mati
I got I got this new toy over here we've
been waiting on and it's really rainy
it's really muddy but it could be really
fun and since my back isn't fixed I kind
of need some some test subjects I mean
this is safe this is safe I'll see you
soon yo let's go see let's go see the
what like the temperature of the water
yo this looks great that's all vinegar
the whole Brittany loves us as it good
not sure you got away yeah he didn't it
is almost swim season baby couple more
months it's gonna be swim season for
country today oh man this is gonna be so
fun are we looking I must say 45 what's
that say 49 48 47 46 that's 45 degrees
dude that's a good guess no today's just
a great example of like girls what the
girls are doing and what the boys are
doing Brett all right locking them out
like it
alright first things first we got to
test the strength of this thing will it
pull on concrete that rope is so little
my thought is if you don't pull on
concrete it'll pull you just about
anywhere that's a lot I don't know man
that's a lot of resistance slow straight
no man you said we're gonna play in the
mud you just say we won't play on
concrete but we need to test it I
figured you're you're pretty good and
hunk of ham you're not gonna fall I
promise you won't fall but this is a lot
to pull so I'm gonna see if it'll pull
you um so here's how this thing works it
has a rope connected to this unit right
here we hooked it to the back of the
quad so we can take it anywhere we want
country holds the ski pole I have the
throttles basically I'm in charge of you
right now all right
test number one fire in the hole there
we go
this is pretty awesome all right you
ready
all right pulls on concrete test number
one it pulls a lot of weight on very
friction surface right so like that was
like the maximum it's really made for
snow and water so for the pull young
concrete but now we need to test speed
we already know it'll pull now we need
speed test how we gonna test number two
speed it could not be so we don't even
need a pond dude look at this in the
water I couldn't tell at all where I was
it stopped like in the tube stirring
like sink I'm yelling god damn engines
too loud I just like oh oh and there's a
hill back here so I keep seeming goes
across the pond he goes under well you
might as well hit the ramp now man work
my plan yeah this is off you won an
award all right tip number three we've
got the speed we've got the pole now
it's off the dock across the pond keep
in mind that the bunt is very cold soup
I'm really took one for the team there
chase actually just showed up as well
with a camera so we just missed such
funny footage guys I'm so sorry
hopefully we can we can make up for it
right now but here's the plan we're
gonna pull directly off the drop in
across the pond you ready dude
yeah eivin i legit was crying I was
filming on my Instagram so I kind of
lost that moment but I was laughing so
hard I was crying at that little stand
up I didn't even know even though you
did makes you lean really hard back
because you're gonna hit these rocks and
he was like gonna play it by ear you
guys been watching the channel you know
we built like a really nice jump out
here and we've taken everything country
ramped a street bike off of it we've
we've done all kinds of things off of it
but Ryan's thinking he can take the tube
off of it and then go across the pond
I'm saying he's got a bail off of it so
here's the jump here's our lip it's it's
lost its eyes from all the rain but it's
still got a really nice lip on it and
then you just go flying
when he when he went up the lip when he
released the raft was like shoo like a
rock gun Wow yo be careful with that
baby that's a real baby
welcome to mud land maudlin speaking my
baby girl girls two of them hey Cora
what are these crazy dudes doing I don't
know if I'm ready for this I think I'm
just gonna stay a baby I know I had a
jumper so yeah there's really no good
way for this one to go because no matter
what for him to hit the jump right with
more speed he has to come directly into
this area which is just a solid row of
rock so he has to jump off before he
gets to this wall he has got to get in
the water no matter what that's called
that's perfect
my goal is to stay on that's the goal
like to stay on and ride it but is that
gonna truly have those pretty launched
in the air
Ruhlman after that speech you gave me
saying that if I do this I could jump
that white Jeep and go find your other
shoe dude look at him look at him dude
mr. captain pathetic yo that was just
genuinely a bunch of great laughs like I
haven't belly laugh for a while like
that dude chase was completely unmovable
in the mud
dude I was literally stuck I had to go
look at my knees I had a camera in one
hand I'm like I got nothing to hold
myself I just dropped the knees when you
hold a camera you can't use your hands
camera comes first we're always like
whatever happens camera comes mercy he
did it that was my camera so you really
did the right thing and you know I was
on the quad most of the time so wait
till we get just dry what I'm feeling
he's gonna be wet too like somewhere
this could be like two months of water
definitely excited about this purchase
guys like I said we ordered this over a
month ago and we had just been waiting
on it we want to do a lot of snow stuff
with it but maybe this is gonna end up
being even more fun just with the water
and I have some other great ideas for if
you have anything you'd like us to like
us to do with this please leave it in
the comment tweet me however you want to
get ahold of me um this thing can do a
lot of fun stuff so let us know what
I'll flash you missed all the mud I mean
the fun I love you for a good thing
you're Paul's nasty oh well you don't
want to get muddy cuz he knows you kick
okay we are back inside I'm all cleaned
out what a muddy muddy muddy mess all
right hi now you want it now you want it
oh boy just coming in she's coming in
hot easy girl do you hit them in the
face
Oh core outward vlogs there they're
getting better is she starting a house
be easier on her
okay core the first thing I'll do is
make an intro okay
so this could be your intro but just
start out like this and you could you
could crawl to camera yeah and then you
could just hit the lens core at would
vlogs where you go you did it you shut
your intro she's got it mom blogger just
shot her first intro and
she's really got this drag technique
where she just is yeah you just you
dragon you dragon you see you want it
but she just she jumps up on her knees
and she does everything but when she
wants to move she's just like I'll just
drive okay so our cat Nitro lives in
shoes I'm not kidding he just lays in
piles of look at he doesn't even look
good like it looks like something where
you'd find a sick cat but that's where
he lives all the time I'll start a
collection I'll just start showing you
guys where he sleeps he probably loved
it if you just put all the shoes off
spaghetti Yeti spaghetti my mommy made
spaghetti for us tonight which is uh all
right no cheese all right you say
goodbye with me bye with me hey hey
goodbye
