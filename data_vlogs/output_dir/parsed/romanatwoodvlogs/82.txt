little roadblock going here but I gotta
get through I am somehow I am seriously

over we gotta touch the but that's your
way there you go
thanks dude oh yeah I somehow still have
this ridiculous back pain I hate
complaining about I hate complaining
period but it's something that's with me
and it's it's very frustrating it's like
that nobody wants a back that hurts you
ready pretty girl you ready okay hey
dude hi bud you ready yeah nice Bob
socket collection other than the back I
feel absolutely fantastic it's beautiful
outside it's almost 70 degrees wearing
t-shirts it is uh the Sun just makes you
feel good I'm telling you we get like
this weird depression going on when it's
just gloomy every day mr. smiley we got
this giant fan back here 70s it feels
like summer honestly um so my uh chase
my buddy chase and I can't talk right
now
Britney's sister Veronica and my best
friend chase had their basement flooded
out while we were gone on our trip so
we're taking this giant fan over and he
already is as our took like my big
submerge pump I should be able to show
you guys we're gonna go and help them
out for a little bit hopefully dry their
basement up and just if they need
anything so that's where we're going
right now it's beautiful we're happy
speaking about beautiful I can't even
see you it's like pitch black angel hey
what's up guys what's up baby I think
they missed you dude I think they missed
you
angel come here baby oh I missed you
pretty doggy the heck's happening over
here dude I've only seen the pictures
well this is all from the basement yeah
oh dude so when we got home from our
trip the basement was like
shot over up to my ankles in water but
it was terrible it's been a rough couple
days imagine if you had all your stuff
on those pallets sitting right there
just imagine all right let's see the
aftermath of the aftermath whoa dude
this is nice do you have anything that
you can show what it did look like all
right so this is the pump that this yeah
so the night we came home from from our
little trip but I came home to about
four and a half inches of standing water
and this is the only clip that I have
your basement floods
we put this giant pump down here and it
literally turn that sump pump well into
a toilet bowl I've never seen anything
like it that thing shot all this water
out of this basement if this has ever
happened to you at your house is
absolutely horrible a flooded basement
you can tell right there how high the
water was I mean you probably got lucky
honestly can always be worse but luckily
I had this crazy pump at the house that
we actually was gonna use this is what
we're gonna use to drill a hole in the
ice on the pond and blow all the water
on top to make a skating rink so we can
play hockey but we never got to so the
only use of tad is Gilroy's house which
hey looks like it worked out perfect
it's amazing how that just so happen to
be in your garage meant to be okay guys
so at the end of the vlog a couple days
ago I mentioned this idea that I want to
just try just for today I want you to do
it with me I'm out here actually like
chase just walked around the corner I'm
like taking selfies of myself because
I'm trying this here's what I want to do
I want to hashtag share your smile and
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna post
a picture of myself smiling and I want
you to come it can be awkward it can be
uncomfortable it can be hard sometimes
to just smile and to put it out there
for the world to see but my thought is
my thought is imagine scrolling down
your timeline you see all these people
smiling right like it would have to
inspire you a little bit to feel a
little better it might just make you
smile yourself so my goal here with
hashtag share your smile is getting
other people to smile and just putting
that out there this this isn't a brand
this is just me this is just something
that I want to see my timeline full of
more positivity I want to see my
timeline make me more happy like to
smile I want to feel better when I look
through my timeline lately so much
negativity there's so many things
bringing me down and bringing you down
and bringing the world down this is just
something so simple show the world your
beautiful smile man you guys are truly
beautiful I say it every day you're one
of a kind
take the photo happy could be you and
your family can be yourself it could be
you with your dog your cat just you
smiling it's so simple and just hashtag
share your smile guys let's just blow it
up let's let's just have fun with it I'm
gonna be posting mine right now as well
and that's it that's it's super simple
it's just something I want to try let's
always lift each other up work together
as a team like we're all here to get

help each other that's my entire goal
