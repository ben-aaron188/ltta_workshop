guys so I went to bed last night hoping
that I would feel so much better today
and my back is just so jacked up by then
we're gonna schedule a CT scan see if
there's something else going on
internally that the doctors just aren't
seeing it is incredibly painful I'm not
too bad right now in fact when I sit
like this I'm okay like as I move around
it kind of loosens it up but as I sleep
through the night it like it like
everything goes like this and just like
cramps everything so as I move around
more and more and more it kind of
loosens up but if I move wrong it just
like sucks my breath out it's just like
that's terrible
that being said not much of a vlog for
you today guys it's just such a bad time
to come back to vlogging I was like I
just should have just waited a few days
but who would have known right I hope I
hope that you're feeling awesome like I
really hope that you're feeling awesome
I just know that we're we're all going
through something right it's like I'm
back from a long big deal there's
somebody going through way more than
that and then there's people going
through less than that but just always
know that you're never alone like
whatever you're going through somebody
else is going through we can get through
it you will get through it you are going
to be stronger than you were before and
all the problems that you're going to
face and you will face are gonna make
you a better person you know make you
stronger they're gonna make you become I
always say the better version of you um
I mean this in the bottom of my heart
guys some of some of the worst things in
my life some of the things that I
thought were the end of my world like
this is it like I'm never gonna recover
ended up becoming and it sounds crazy
but those giant problems that
I thought we're gonna just destroy me
they ended up becoming some of my
biggest blessings I mean without those
things that happened it could be
anything it could be you know your
girlfriend broke up with you your your
girlfriend cheated on you your boyfriend
cheated on maybe you lost your job
maybe you failed that giant test you
didn't get into the school you wanted
whatever it is but without that problem
you don't get to where you're supposed
to be and I know that sounds insane but
it's so true my most devastating times
in my life have become giant blessings
and without those giant devastations I
wouldn't be where I am today so take
that to heart listen to me when I say
that whatever you're going through right
now you have to go through and you you
need to go through it and it sounds
crazy but it's true you overcome it you
fix yourself you become better version
at you and that's what's most important
always grow always become a better
person we need better people I love you
guys so much I need a little motivation
myself and I always push you guys and I
like to just talk out loud because it
pumps me up it makes me feel better
that's right I did get through that and
now I am where I am today and I love it
so get through it push through it fight
through it punch through it don't punch
things that's hard bro I learned a
lesson
I love you guys thanks for all the level
in this channel a lot of you've been
here since before I had anything and I
love that you're here with me today

the best on my back that I can just
