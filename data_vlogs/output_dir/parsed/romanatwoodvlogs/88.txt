beef turkey right you just walked up so
you want the blog camera I bought
explain over the last few days Noah has
said why don't you just give me the
camera for a day and let me do a vlog
and I'm dude I'm not against it first of
all what would you blog welcome to my
world
welcome to my world I have no idea I
don't know be great because as we you
know have days where it's just so
difficult to follow with some of the
things that we have to do know it maybe
you just know outward vlogs just take
over the channel here it is take the
camera all done but know your channel
see buddy if you need me I'm here but in
the meantime have fun man okay seriously
what I have this is my serious face okay
I was sitting in the inner chair and I
open this drawer why do you have why do
you have all that okay for one in
chocolate chocolate I feel like you know
late nights when I'm working really hard
I deserve a snack you mean in battle
guns my show not yours yeah I know
there's popcorn in there
it's my popcorn not summer where you
live it's not warm I'm assuming you're
like me right now and you're ready for
it to get one we still have some snow
actually which is crazy for us and I
think like if you watch the blogs we
really did a lot with the snow we had
and we were like snow is gonna go away
we got it and we did like we really used
it but the snow bit went away and it
just keeps coming back so now we're like
kind of tired of the snow chai never
thought I'd ever say that and if you
missed the video where we got this a 4x4
Jeep Cherokee ask you guys what we
should do with it and a lot of you had
such great ideas from like some of you
were like restore it put nice tires on
and I'm thinking hey I don't know if
that works for me like I like like I see
this thing getting airtime or something
like something something crazy but the
vehicle is actually pretty nice I always
saw rusty it's got dents that it died on
me while I was driving it like it's not
that nice
drives and in the formal drive work so
if you have any idea I'm taking ideas
here cuz I don't know what to do is I
feel like I've maxed out my ideas on
vehicles lately so it's here if you can
think of anything awesome that would be
great country just keeps asking to take
it in upon like legit and I'm like dude
that's such a bad like my pons too deep
you got to take precaution Aries if
you're going into that pond you can't
even see the pond right now it's just
completely snowed out well I'm not the
only I'm not the only one getting tired
of the snow you won't even come outside
with me you done with it
you had enough sit oh I see what you
want blessed ones these he wants these
well cheese it I can
hi-hi-hi came this place is looking you
guys remember we got the mirrors for our
our little mini gem down here working on
it looks so much better weird having
mirrors because sometimes you catch
yourself vlogging like this and look out
that's weird like I don't know when I
film myself it's weird like that you did
you do squats today you already did it
what is that box squat that's a squat
you know go down far enough you go stand
on your tiptoes even get on the bar wait
you mean adds more weight it's 30 pounds
get it I can hold this all day no power
up there you go juice what's the worst I
know what do you want to do squats it's
fun all right no not really
I enjoy it you have not worked out
forever you nice Eric and out again let
me see this is me forsen oh my god
flexing guys this is um again it's
current-day blog I got I got a I gotta
admit like I've struggled we took a few
days off which was great but there was
this there was so much going on at that
time I guess I can probably get into it
more later but sometimes it's really
difficult to pick up the camera and
pretend that everything's great and I
don't like to come on camera when
everything's not great because I hate
potentially bringing you down I love my
videos to always inspire you guys uplift
you guys even if it's if it's just the
normal vlog I try to make it as positive
as possible I look for you guys to be
motivated I want you to end my videos
with just feeling
than you did before you started watching
the videos and if I come on here with my
problems I just feel like I'm gonna
bring everybody down so there's some
days where not only we just do a
business crap like things that I really
wouldn't blog anyways but it's sometimes
it just feels negative to me and I hate
I don't like bringing negative into the
vlogs I like an very uplifting I like it
fun I like it possible I get family and
I'm not gonna lie like we're real people
we have real problems all the time we
have businesses we have we have problems
everywhere and sometimes it's you know
you there's a lot of reasons not to
smile you know and I don't like to come
on here and and bring that on you guys
so some days I'm just gonna be honest
I'm not always so happy like there's
plenty of things in my life that go
wrong every day sometimes it's hard to
pull out that camera and put that smile
on your face sometimes you know you are
in a bad mood you don't feel good or
things just weigh you down I just want
you guys know I'm just like you and I do
have these problems and on those days it
is hard to pull out this camera and try
to keep you guys happy so other than
that everything's actually really really
good the family's amazing Cora's amazing
Britney and I are amazing it's just
everything is good there's just a little
behind the scenes things that are
annoying sometimes

start tomorrow's video keep your guys
