done it you excited he nervous we are
first of all we have GoPros rigged up
all over the place you know and Julian
are here behind it so on and we are
going to be attempting the other picture
on your phone yeah so as you guys may or
may not know Britney's pretty good at
face paint and this is kind of a modest
face paint right this isn't too crazy
but it's still cool today we thought I
thought it may be pretty darn comical if
Britney has to perform her face paint
skills while I Drive the x3 so remember
that before picture and now we're gonna
create the after fun I'm not gonna I'm
not gonna like I'm gonna cut my eyes out
well physically cut your eyes I'm so
excited to see what you can do here yeah
you're gonna be really great she's
fantastic
go slow we're not we're not going fast
we don't have helmets organs can be
cruising through some trails there's
some bumps there's some river there's
some water I think you should have
everything ready
we've got her cup of water for mixing
chase has rigged up a bunch of cameras
this being the most shady camera Kim
will do yeah it looks like it's out so
it's basically it Britt it's your own
mobile makeup stand if we could give we
could we could you could do rides like
hey come with me I'll paint your face or
take your eyes out that would be
hilarious
so we will be rigged up in the x3 which
is already covered you can't even see
the art no more it's it's the rap is
completely gone got a little GoPro up
here so you guys can see the trails and
exactly what we're hitting while she's
trying to paint that could be funny to
have like in the corner of the video see
like see all the bumps while she's
trying to do this Maiko somehow could be
fun I love your eyes though be careful
wait did you bring your mirror you
forgot a mirror
I'm just wait what if I can angle this
down at you you want the rearview mirror
