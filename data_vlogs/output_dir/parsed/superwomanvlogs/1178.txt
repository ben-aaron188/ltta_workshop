they tell me why I totally forgot I
shoot and I'm just pressing snooze this
morning like I ain't got age to do all
right so I'm hanging downstairs the car
is waiting to pick me up and I'm really
tired all over again
this is my life every morning of these
shoots I feel like even if I get like
seven eight hours of sleep which is
pretty good I'm still really tired
because it's the thought of hey I don't
just have to like get up and then do a
job well I don't like to say job because
I love doing this I'd even consider a
job but like it's just thought it'd also
be like oh I have to do a makeup and be
on and act and do well that's like oh
that's a lot a lot of work good welcome
to day two of shooting the tubes
highness my baby love toothpaste I mean
this is another thing though it's really
hard to not like being a good mood in LA
because there's a sunny and wonderful so
this was the hot set from yesterday I
want to say hot set you know I don't
know what that means either but I
learned yesterday the caution tape
indicates don't touch any of these
cameras because the cameras and the
positions they're in are locked and we
have to shoot angel and if they move the
round they won't be able to put all
three characters in the same scene so
that's one reason it's a hot set no one
mother I've been touch these props or
camera because that's look identical
from yesterday there if you didn't know
that now you do you learned something
you you're a giant you don't even look
at this everybody rock stars you brought
rocks at straws no let's say she want to
go search the rock stars out there on
the table
yeah did you say we don't have any yeah
then we're gonna wrap her hair and we're
gonna take small sections about to go
down in danger look how good PJ looks
today all smile PJ's girl my hair was
dreading and I had just to be real let's
do this
and then we maybe want to bring this but
here's the post-it hi everyone angels
here only I'm so tired
Oh John hey I think we're not shooting
around it's fine so this wig usually
kills me like it's the most painful
thing ever and if it's throwing up as a
cell so tight but PJs strategically cut
it of it so right now I'm feeling
alright hopefully it doesn't start
killing me because this is like the most
dreaded character even though she's so
fun to play this wig alright the schooi
registration i just like to point out
today that conveniently we have robes
and towels because my double is gonna
get wet but yesterday we literally had a
napkin and a half to drive myself oh

makeup oops
