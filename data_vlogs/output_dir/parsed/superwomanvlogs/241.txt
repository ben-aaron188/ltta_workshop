hi
guess what PAC TV lives welcome back to
losing blood today's gonna be a sick day
I woke up had myself some breakfast it
was nice and calm but that stops now he
was gonna get intense here's the mission
late we are what are we doing I'm gonna
shoot a thing on I write a thing I'm a
call girl show look at my emails imma
drink lots of water
speaking of which it was full give me
the points and I gotta pee
here's why I don't like drinking water
because I always have to keep peeing and
peeing is so inefficient store waste of
time you know like stop what you're
doing on the toilet pee and it's just
this it's like I could be creating art
you know unless my pee is art time to do
makeup I've something to say and I'm
nothing's gonna be a popular opinion by
any means but my hair is starting to
really really annoy me as I'm like I
can't do anything oh my god doctor I
can't do anything with it
it's just so long so under baiting to
like maybe get it layered or highlight
or something I haven't decided but I'm
playing with the idea in my head because
right now it's like it's just a hot mess
all the time it's like I put my bindi in
the wrong spot not too shabby give it a
point Real Talk me leaving anywhere to
go anywhere is such a disaster noise
caring the 100 things like a bag a phone
a blogging camera drink I'm always
dropping crap leave me leaving any
establishment Oh a hot goddamn mess well
we're off let's go I guess that's why
girls were purses I need pants with more
pockets that's the solution it's lovely
it's wonderful I always feel like
wonderful but also stupid when I'm here
because a lot of things I react to him
like what are this thing I've never
heard of before but they lie to me and
say I do a good job so that's why I love
them give me the coins for there we
killed it being productive
and now we're gonna shoot another
episode every time I do our youtubers
react I get so inspired by benny and
rafi zefa and my bros empire company
they got going on with the offices and
the employees not something I've been
thinking more and more about getting
like an office space although like that
means I have like I should go somewhere
and even my house but like I've been
thinking more and more about it so this
is really inspirational but now I gotta
go home I gotta stop to get some labels
from my label maker and some other stuff
and then I got a team home so let's go
you're in Hollywood win a lot of times
we do things in Hollywood I get process
like that when I did the Ambrose SWAT
walk they were protesting outside being
like cover yourself up Jesus will not
forgive you for your sins and I just
like time in place I think right now
there go testing against same-sex
marriage you went hollywood west
hollywood really pick a time and place
we're not the majority it's actually my
favorite thing about living in LA
everyone is so open-minded like there's
not a way you could dress or a sexual
preference you could have a belief that
you can have that is not accepted it is
like so open-minded so I love both this
I mean I teach the wrong god that's you
do your thing I'm gonna keep driving
just being like home different I'm from
a team call let's do it like I mention
every Sunday I have a team called my
team their camera team called you so we
can go over the week get everybody
excited get everyone pumped and on the
same page the boss is here

everyone hyper second all the energy all
