watching this right now
right right right right now my new video
is coming out as a DIY perdicas little
sneak peek normal highlighters are so
boring
they're literally just me on a bright
and colorful so here's a fun DIY that
you can do instead of paying attention
in class bleed ink from one highlighter
into another highlighter and then get a
multicolored highlighter that will last
literally for nine seconds it doesn't
really matter what you're highlighting
as long as it looks cute so stay tuned
for that
