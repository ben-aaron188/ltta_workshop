my sleep schedule is a hot effin
disaster good afternoon so I didn't vlog
yesterday why because I woke up at 5:00
p.m. and I was like oh the day is done
my sleep schedule is so F because the
day I landed on Christmas Eve I was so
tired and took a nap and ever since that
nap I have an F because every day I've
been napping for like four hours thus
not allowing me to fall asleep at night
thus make me wake up late so it's like
3:30 p.m. right now I'm disgusted in
myself but holidays what's happening

don't have many of them but like a few a
few people like eight people are coming
over and I'm excited to see them with

movies and have a good time in our
sweats and I'm really really excited
