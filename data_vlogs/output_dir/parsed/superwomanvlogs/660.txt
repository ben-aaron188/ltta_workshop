okay 11:32 right no quarter song right
now one half in a song I need to
memorize the five that I wrote I need to
pack for Montreal Impact for Italy
Toronto there's one Kenya and then go to
sleep I do it about 7:00 a.m. how does
it eckhart life I'm quitting I quit I
quit I'm gonna sleep the next three days
not nothing
sobbing get to work I'm gonna be honest
with you I don't know what I'm doing I'm
kind of giving up I finished the song to
the best of my ability it was not at all
enjoyable writing music should be
enjoyable it was not because I was so
rushed and tired
and I kind of finished packing pre
Montreal but then realize that I'm also
packing for my shoot tomorrow
so like half the stuff has to take
tomorrow all I have to do the shoot
tomorrow which means somehow someway
there's gonna be a situation tomorrow or
at the shoot I'm gonna have to actually
pack for Montreal amongst the chaos and
I need me start packing for a delete run
on them I don't I don't
because how can I back from pathes
definitely no Marshall half the stuff to
shoot I stuff whenever take to hit early
in Toronto in Kenya in Brazil I just
don't even know I don't even know I
don't even know a stupid thing to
complain about no time so I was so
overwhelmed with things to do I
literally land and like if I was trying
to come home I'd be a flex 30 minutes
max so unless I think I can pack in 30
minutes which maybe if I make a list we
possible what I don't see it happening
today I don't know I don't know I don't
know so I don't know I don't know hi hi
this is MIA no it is what it is really
what just happened what I do I undo what
what I do I don't even know what time is
1:30 1:00 a.m. but record this track you
know things like this I hate rushing it
because I I really
feel like I had more time to I really
feel like I had more time to do them
it's not that the lyrics aren't and
genuine they're still genuine but I
would love more time to be like let me
really really go over this over and over
over again I still have that I'm um I'm
sorry best so it is what it is
and I got my period and I should fuck
you know what
stop really stop you're overwhelmed it's
okay it's you know what this is I need
to use this makeup on my shoulders I'm
falling asleep like this um you know
just gotten your wake up and you'll be
so f and tired and you wash it yourself
you get through it you do your absolute
best what's bothering more than anything
is that like I'm a perfectionist and so
when I know I'm but I know I'm rushing
things and I know things are exactly how
I want them to be they could be better
that your takes me but this is an
important lesson for me to learn like I
can't I need to understand my body and
brain has limits because when I think of
ideas and scheduling I'm like I don't
account for that like sleep or like
human condition I'm just like yeah yeah
anyway five song one in a row so like
sometimes I need to be smacked by
reality but I did it gonna happen I hope
