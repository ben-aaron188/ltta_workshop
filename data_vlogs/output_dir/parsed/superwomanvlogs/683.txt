positive thinking in the garden of my
mind I already love it in the garden of
my mind a lot of the good thoughts and
weed out the bad ones I know it I throw
in forgiveness and empathy seeds by the
handful if I want and I take a lawn
mower to that jealousy and resentment
patch I'm a pretty bad beep mind
gardener I love that in the garden of my
mind I water the good thoughts and we
are the bad ones you know I like what
this cards they emphasize how in control
you are they're not just like oh you
know bad things happen just you know
tough em oh it's like yo you're in
control that's why we like these cards
dances crack-a-lackin' nominee ready to
go two minutes she said that ten minutes
ago days yeah you finished my call when
my calls that canceled but I finished
out the call ahead was the interview I
was doing on my hoverboard and I ran
into something so I was like yeah and I
started YouTube started you to youtube
on that's what's poppin is so hot it's
so wonderful it's a great day hope
you're having a great day I haven't been
that productive yet and it's five
a bomb that the video had prepared for
today I can't release for today I'm
hurting for make a video so much stuff
that dome but I fucking home and get mum
as I just posted my sexy picture with
Zack and Adam were you seeing what he
was that was popping um and that's was
crackling - what's going on and I have
nothing else to say other than those
things also you I shed like a mother if
I don't know about you guys but I've
shed a lot like my hairs everywhere all
the time
Opel's cracka lackin time is 748 p.m. I
think is at the right time 748 ya much
made my video since well it's Canada Day
I'm making a video it's my annoy love
some people are pissed so Americans off
but it's all in light-hearted fun it's
called what Canadians really want to say
to Americans now it's like this like a
stupid friendly rivalry Americans and
Canadians have like you know it's
friendly it's nothing too hostile but I
always get teased for being Canadian by
my American friends cuz I move to
America I get teased about everything so
it's just like you know a little
friendly rebuttal South's gonna I'm kind
of Nordica shot this video so much
better in Canada when I was there but
then I was told I had to lose another
beard a long story short is annoying but
I created this Molson Canadian bottle
obviously I couldn't buy it so I just
like made a prop out of it on another
label that's a maple syrup I have I make
this thing happen let go so I'm gonna be
honest that video was not fun to shoot
because I just kept thing like this
could been so much better if I had the
props from Canada and if I had more time
to prep and if it wasn't such a
last-minute change so I'm a little bit
annoyed and the lighting just changed
too drastically it looks like that play
two characters looks like totally
different places and different times and
just like I'm sorry trying my best I'm
gonna edit this release this meeting
some stale pita chips so that's all I
have and I'm going to eat some dinner
and get my life together a little bit
because I'm clearly falling apart as an
adult which I'm clearly I'm don't so
stale yo I'm so happy so where you like
the video is actually doing really
really well and that means really happy
I tried to adjust the color in lighting
as much as I could but I'm not good at
that I'm not a color
factor do any of that stuff yeah so I'm
really glad you guys like it I cleaned
up the place a little bit I still have
been my most productive self I've only
done call and video and dropped off an
Anthony he and a few other things but I
still have a lot of work to do so i'ma
do that I fucking investigate some sort
of dinner situation since I need
anything and now everything's closed not
being a good adult today no I'm just
kidding I have Oreos oh wait those are
still in case you're sitting there like
why is everything in Lilly's place still
really such a waste to everything is
still everything be tasted like drywall
I pick up a piece of bread tastes like
cardboard reason is I'm one person
living here I buy things right I have
finished things one person Pete things
that you buy in the grocery store
don't come equipped for one person so
things go bad and I try my best but
things still go by a me yam say so I
might have to have three still Oreos for
dinner nom I figure something out
still but fries almost still will keep
you posted because I know your days come
to a halt because my and white dinner
situation at least mussels Big Poppa
Pump carinii I'm just going crazy I
think I live for you I think I that boy
I don't do any of those things I I don't
want to die for you I don't I don't know
you know people say that I would die for
you and stuff I'm just like why would
you do that I'd be sad you know like why
would you is love Sam says like yo I
take a bullet for you I'd die for my why
would you make me live with that guilt I
don't want you to do that don't do that
that's that's rude that that's selfish
but why would I want to why why would I
want to live my life knowing that you
took both of me I love realistic love
songs bro realistic like y'all I I
occasionally might give you the last
piece of cake that's you know I'd be
like you know what I can live with that
and that's not gonna keep me up at night

sweet tooth they just make logical sense
