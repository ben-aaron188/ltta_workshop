time whatever and there be so many

not that hard give it a quick Google

so they'll be there we hit the
livestream because you are the boss team
and I love you you raise my self-esteem
and this broccoli is green you know when
you watch the movies and somebody's in
front of a computer and they're trying
to like hack into the system they type
ridiculously fast and you're like nobody
even types that fast
except for this guy little look it's
even typing real words like that but
then I also realized this because I feel
like I type with the tips of my fingers
so I'm just like J age she liked the
tips because she has long nails she has
the type of like the philosopher fingers
that she typed like this so apparently
the story checks out
but how do you guys think about now go
ahead go to keyboard and how do you type
on your keyboard do you type with like
this what do you type like this okay
I type like this and you're saying you
type like this yes but when I see you
time I see this this is pretty flood
does he have meals they get it but I'm
just saying it's literally sound like
she's she's hacking into the CIA
every second of every moment was he I
think that's the determination to get
the script done she's just like it's
like done video I'll give her that one
you need the limb
hey so I just recorded my video it is
types of fans part two you've been
requesting for so so so long and so I
finally decided to do it um I feel like
I'm kind of losing my touch with writing
videos can you stop I'm trying to use a
life in the computer and you keep
opening programs and it's effing up with
the light you're really being
disrespectful yeah I feel like I'm kind
of losing my touch with writing videos
I'm not too happy with this script and I
feel like I it's not funny and I've just
like went over 2,000 times and I
couldn't figure it out I'm just like wow
why can't I do this and I'm just kind of
like beating myself up over it and then
I was like this is I also wants the same
thing last week remember when I couldn't
figure out a video ID and I was like
going crazy and it's kind of been it
consists
thing and I'm just like I'm not good at
this anymore I don't know freaking out
and that part of me was like maybe I
should take a break from making videos
because I don't feel like they're good
and I don't feel like they're funny and
I don't feel like they're the best I
could do is so I'm kind of baiting like
to take a break from making videos is
that horrible horrible horrible you mind
do hate it I was thinking about taking
like a month break
I'm not making any videos and like
seeing if I could get that back and
stuff just someone like me but I was
really really thinking I think that's
what I'm gonna do I think I want to take
a month of not making videos to try to
get it back there's that horrible as oh
wait what's the date did I do this right
