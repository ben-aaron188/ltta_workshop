I feel like I've been gone for so long
came back that summer it's like I missed
a lot of the winter did I miss the
winter well that makes no sense
when should I leave may disregard
everything I just said
it is interview day today I just
interviewed right now about 6:00 and the
great thing about jetlag is I wasn't
tired so I did one interview and I got
three or four more to go Hummels gonna
join me for one of them jazz gonna join
me throughout the day and then I made my
nails done with Nana that's the eventful
day I'm hoping it's a very very
productive work day I feel it today I
feel it I'm not gonna let any jet lag or
anything get to me today's gonna be
productive we go home the day baby let's
go because I'm late hi I'm so late hi
I'm so late I hate traffic I am so late
you know what I got tweets about that
you've never seen this before yeah thank
you all right yo so we just finished our
interviews now we're eating from
McDonald's Chipotle's closed for the two
hours or me that's not really it is so
I'm like I refuse I'm gonna have to pull
away today remember breakfast tumble
angrily angrily went back to adults and
put bacon in the sandwich after messing
up this order to do bad things
the beard is angry oh my god I'm the
worst human so I changed my last
interview to make it just over the phone
so I headed home totally forgetting
gonna do my nails done with no sh it
home scoped our pastor knows Jamie Bell
do the interview and go back towards her
area you'll finish that interview took a
30-minute nap now I'm going to do a
conference call that half it's an hour
and then I have another conference
coffin that that's 30 minutes but we're
gonna do it I wish I could give you a
tour of my brain of how much this tour
is changing me somethings better some of
the worse actually none for the worse
I'm learning so much things so all for
the better I've just become so much more
I'm tempted to use the word cutthroat
but I don't think that's the right word
it's just I'm a very unicorn happy
person but I've learned that when it
comes to business sometimes you can't
always be like that and it's a very hard
lesson I'm learning where I'm trying to
still be a very nice person but I've
also learned there's nothing wrong with
being like yo this is how I need things
this is what needs to get done and
that's okay
Game of Thrones has taught me that and
Ari Gold has taught me that as well but
I've just noticed I may cause a lot more
sentimental talk with you about this
later but I'm about this conference call
right now so do so just finish two hours
worth of conference calls and I'm
feeling good I got pages and pages of
notes
and things to do with our to-do list the
size of my her right now and font 11 did

many walls and barriers and obstacles
and I'm looking at them and they're
right here and I'm just like you know
what I'm gonna do what I always do I'm
gonna take a hammer and I'm gonna break
them that ass down I'm not gonna put my
