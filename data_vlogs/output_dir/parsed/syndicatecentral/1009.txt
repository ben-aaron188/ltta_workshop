Supra how you feel enough last night hey

combination when you have paintball guns

horsing around
ah good size that guy's junk I have not
been to Starbucks in forever so do you

office hundred ten percent bathtub you
know turn this into my office watch this
space and of course I stuck myself onto
the roof your this spot already opened
up fine through it but goddamn this is
uh it's pretty way off oh my god I'm
gonna steal up what is that a cat is
that actually a looks like a lion look
look how high up I am and look how big
that guy is what the fuck that's
ridiculous
I love home over in Alan goes what the
hell is this look over here and Angela
bought behind in the other vlog I showed
that I bought a beaver that represents
team like I think like hard-working but
be high represents
like teamwork coming together to build
into together but I'm allergic to wasps
please I've a very striking opinion
about why I'm going to destroy this one
day then look at this thing this is
absolutely terrifyingly awful I cannot I
cannot get on the I came not get on the
same page look at it to see that what
you doing down try not fucking set it
off
what are you doing time something that
you should never do you know I don't
play football inside like I'm playing
with the drone
this is not a safe area
I'm so scared
it's so incredibly responsive No
it's the camera love life
this is a flying's only gentleman
spectra god I think you should probably
look you should be staring through here
as much as you're here
my one how do you feel about this
yeah
it's it is safe Marwan
Allen
how do you feel about this oh thank you
Oh
glenda
go ahead
that is legit
I didn't crush it well hate the filming
Luke
the man who previously crashed it no
like a sad kid on Christmas I came out
with the drone to play with it on the
roof and it's raining what is wrong with
you la oh my god
would you look at that view hey Alan you
want to say this again no cuz you're
liar this just don't trust this guy
listen to that logic got money video up
like this thumbnail it's like them this
might be the most petrifying thumbnail
anime Alan what are you doing we've got
a baseball bat spiked versus a machete
this is not we need human resources in
this fucking office space because you
two are gonna get us arrested and see
now this is just staring as older son of
a bitch well the office is looking nicer
you know it's getting there it's good to
be high but my space it's empty and this
this is the rig for the is this what
program is going programmers are going
to here and then this this room I
believe is gonna be a gaming room this
where I'm going to be live-streaming all
day every day otherwise doesn't work but
once we get this site out ventilated and
stuff this is where I'm just be
screaming my face off live shooting
whilst everyone's actually doing real
work out here cuz we all know
live-streaming and making videos for
YouTube isn't real work yeah like Hilary
do you care to explain why we have a
combat axe a machete a bone knife what
the fuck is this thing and a baseball
bat with barbed wire on it cuz we know
I'll go with that we fuck shit up
it's in case that beaver ever turns real
like it's probably a curse the beaver
that at night comes alive and we have to
take it out yeah zombie Beavis no
longers we don't know zombie cow game no
zombie cow zombie beavers but place
around the car
from the new office this for making them
read right there I like it very fresh
okay I officially love this place think
of Christmas decorations the law going
on because music even that you and the
Christmas spirit I am I am in the I am
right up that nostril I can tell this
tube it's amazing and it tastes amazing
not too sure about this thing have to
try it look at this first speed throw it
then roll it they don't they split it
they stretch it here at 3d I just get
here I have a cell phone fall asleep
like that's what I do until that rig
self in the other room for me to game in
then I just basically sit here I'm like
okay just let everyone get on with their
days and I just messed around on
snapchat but we were hiring more and
more people at the moment so my tight
Nick's family of people that I love and
know is about to grow if I don't like
the people we're firing the people that
is an absolutely beautiful sunset oh
yeah so nice it doesn't look real crazy
yeah exactly for Ricky you're so dead
from yesterday do you remember anything
I don't remember then our dudes stops
watch the video and then I couldn't
Saturn you done fucked up case I don't
blame you I'm getting better going to
sleep for an hour it's four o'clock in
the afternoon we're completely out of it

after sleeping flight three hours was
like this is a great idea to decide to
go and buy a hundred revolver cases and
keys currently the way my bank comes up
I can't actually do it so I am
scrounging together every little last
bit of money because I can't use my bank
Otakon all these PayPal I'm scrounging
together all the money so I can do on a
hundred case key opening stream right
now on twitch.tv so you will see soon on
my main channel how much of a failure
this was this is like a four hundred
pounds worth of keys and cases for a
hundred cases late ladies and gents I
got the ache a sexual i got an
executioner which I think was fit yet
field-tested and this is from another
one we got all these quite a lot of
purples we got so many ricochets got a
crapload of deagles unbelievable about P
to thousands and then quite a lot of
these scars we got stat tracks as well
but uh we got what we wanted and we
probably got one of the best things that
we could have got which is a by the way
it's called the 402 because I like it
but we got this which is factory new
faction in okay ladies German factory
nude my chat has given me like Piper's
shit bought that is worth $50

400 pounds on a Santana so overall was
