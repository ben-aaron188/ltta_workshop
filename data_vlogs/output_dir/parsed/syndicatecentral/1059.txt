taxi for like 20 miles to get to the
hotel where I've got to meet someone to
organize my paperwork to get to the
embassy then at the Embassy hopefully go
there and get it all taken care of if
not then this was a completely wasted
trip but fingers crossed it should all
go smoothly
I believe I've been up since yesterday
and awake today I need to pass out on
there's a monument okay yo just shouting
out to Xbox they've put me in a fancy
hotel holy fucking shit super fancy
whooping so my hotel check-ins not until

just gonna get in the room and go to bed
for like two hours wake up go downstairs
to the hotel spa get a fucking full-body
massage relax this shit just real chill
the fuck out and catch up on some sleep
because I've had none at all and then

is now 3 o'clock good good couple of
hours hopefully wake up I threw myself
out of bed because I had to dream I got
text saying I was going meeting Obama

thing called where they all go a cockade
no I don't know why was God but I got to
see load of that if Obama was in that
and you guys saw him I just throw up a
minute to say I saw him I think it was
like the Koreans or something like that
but either way it was awesome awesome to
watch that like one guy be wounded out
you could see the stock of he's like I
think it's like an m4 rifle or an mp5 or
whatever it was I was like yo shit that
is awesome
