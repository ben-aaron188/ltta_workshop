BMW home my hair has been like this all

of neat and tidy well I look not neat
and not tight legs I'm so damn tired and
this is the first time it's one of my
favorite things to do after that and
this is not me being rude to my audience
or not that but their fault and I get to
watch bands and with soap and hot water
all packed up I left a small tip for the
cleaner only two pounds I would actually
leave in 20 quid because the staff here
amazing what I don't have anymore money
has just changed but anyway amazing
hotel room this time this time it didn't
smell like steak remember like wait what
last time we stayed above like the
kitchen is open it smelt like
cheeseburgers the entire time but this
hotel room was epic the staff have been
amazing of God I'm about to leave here
with my backpack am ia suitcase poor I
almost forgot my lion I still have no
idea who this is from
what rather they put it in the box I'm
gonna carry this light in the entire way
home with me like this
so yeah hotel room thank you for your
hospitality I had a good night's sleep
after my first night after I sleep fix
my sleep schedule and I will be back I
think for next year go admit I didn't
really it is a life I'm kitty gate down
five he's down would you fuck
so fuck all the here's oh my god
beautiful car she was a beast we
actually drove the entire way home then
for two hours with no music we all just
needed a break to switch off so we drove
him far away in pure silence
this is exactly all I want in life right
now to be sat down Chinese I'm about to
watch Mad Men decided to watch Mad Men
was probably a bad idea cuz I was up
until about 2:00 a.m. watching episodes
I've only had three hours sleep from
that last clip you saw me I'm so
exhausted but I cannot be asked ruining
my sleep schedule again I'm falling into
that despairing hourly ruin day so I'm
forcing myself to stay awake pretty much
the next day I really really really
tired I actually ranked Alice this
morning to speak to her and get like
updates and how everything's been from
the show and stuff like that and I will
call this up like 11 o'clock in the
morning so she hadn't even got out of
bed and my mom she's just woke up at
half past 1:00 in the afternoon I'm the
one who should be waking up at a
ridiculous time not then but I'm home
sweet home tomorrow's vlog you're gonna
get a big update on my internet I'm my
granddad cuz he's been over the past two
weeks turn up at my house like nearly
every other day every other day he's
been turning up have you been in bed or
busy or going out I've just got the time
to see him no I've got some some update
news about that but obviously the more
important thing to say is the comments
and a vlog have been ably bomb a public
absolutely bombarded with where's Livia
where's Lydia why's Lydia not insomnia
why she's not going down I don't
understand why Lydia's not insomnia she
was there last year in simple terms
Lydia didn't come down to insomnia
because I didn't want Lydia there and
you my black wall I did insomnia last
year with Lydia and every time like I
was going out to like whatever time in
the morning I was having business
meetings and hanging out with industry
people that I really didn't have a lot
of time for Lydia and it wasn't fair on
her and it really really sucked but it
put a lot of stress on me and her
because I just wanted to come in go to
bed and fall asleep and then sleep until
the very last minute until I started the
show whereas Lydia was working on mini
ladder and terrorises booth so she had
to get up at like 8:00 a.m. to get over
to the booth so like I was only getting
like maybe two hours sleep after I was
getting in and I was just like I can't
do it this time like you saw how tired I
was this time alone this event that if
Lydia was there in a very selfish way
she would have just been waking me up
and I would have been absolutely
exhausted it's rather than me stressing
myself out with all and anything like
that
I put the funds first I got as much rest
as I could and I had
absolute great time book so everyone who
brought even Lydia like a letter or a
president's in LA I'll make sure it gets
to a don't you worry don't panic I don't
know a load of your white to meet your
and get far but I did kind of mention it
on a live stream a few times that she
wasn't coming down but a lot of people
in the vlog didn't know that so just let
you know there is your answer I work to
make sure I was fully focused to meet
you guys and you and my priority number
one so nonetheless guys thank you very
