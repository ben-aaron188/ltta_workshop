up to it like we didn't do meet in
Greece or anything like that it was just
so although he was popular then and we
had to get security for him and he had
to fight in the press room and it's
still the same it's mad this is the bit

introduce you to this area is reserved
for tom cassell and we've got all these
chairs and tables to ourselves

by our side this is a pretty good
situation if I could say oh my god
tality you know we literally lock down
the entire bill that there's like no
sound because the speakers are playing
like radio music for the entire like
model so we can't change that however we
have this TV with the quietest music

AJ stuff oh look at that it just
miraculously came loose once again haha
McMahon's taking on three million
dollars it's like safe I'll take it
if AJ knocks him out this round if I
were to put a bet on
I wouldn't want 250 grand but didn't
Cosmo mom said don't do it
I cannot believe one minute 40 on the
clock
AJ doesn't even need to knock him out
anything with it but if he does is a
legend AJ definitely took that I'm so
sad there wasn't and I would have lost
my money though just saying my bet ten
grand twelve round knockout with a lost
my money so hey AJ's won it and I kept
my money nice
