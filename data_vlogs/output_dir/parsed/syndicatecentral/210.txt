make the decision of whether or not one
drink and insomnia because I love
meeting funds and the meeting viewers

hate about these events is the hangovers
because you know we get drunk together
and it gets a bit crazy and it gets me
intense especially at the pub quiz and I
do not want to feel like crap
we're meeting you guys so I may have to
make the mental the mind the man the man
the mighty decision to decide upon not
drinking it insomnia so I can have a
clear fresh brain but I have said that
every single event so far and then I
drink hmm hey looking forward to it
