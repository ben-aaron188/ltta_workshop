love it this restaurant is so nice I got
all this food oh that's all that going
on taps Janos very nice dude turns out
is the in-house DJ I even googled it is
there's like pump the road so he was
like if you want to come by on Saturday
come on by before you leave it's like
that's pretty dope what he did just
advises is if you walk past a red-light
district don't take photos I don't even
think about lacks I'd be like vlogging
our reaction the girls might think we're
actually filming that which we're not
gonna do you remember like Tom we're
going to red light district Lydia she
wants to go that's B point with a mouth
but nonetheless we're in Amsterdam I
think we have to walk past simplistic oh
my love this is beautiful it's really
really is nice no apparently the traffic
it isn't bad at all like just because
you love all the Trump's then all the
bikes welcome to the first-ever canal
we've found and isn't it nice oh oh oh
oh it's great Oh beautiful Bon Appetit
totally wrong language but whatever
white chocolate waffle with a Kinder
Bueno on top you're done right I want
one
look at all this fucking food we were
talking to that guy so commonly behind
the bar that we liked straight deep you
think about Pam yeah and we were walking
out he was like okay bye
I got to like fucking pay but being a
good dude I was like bro yeah I'm paid
and gave me some discount and then I
paid him yeah look at that beautiful I
think we found literally a red-light
district ever come back some girl with
titties Tommy but yo more impressively
like a mini castle in Amsterdam I don't
know I don't even know what look the
hell that's it that's an even smaller
small smart guy huh
tiny look this is a castle I don't know
what its far off or what it is but sure
gutted me when we like a spaghetti left
the shop where the red-light district is
zero outside and take a look and he was
all empty I was like fine it's gonna be
quiet
so I don't know someone knows look No
just look how busy this place is abscess
super clean I think but look how big it
is down there
this woman this woman was like looking
at another woman inside there and she
walked actually what did she say yeah
and then you got like that intimidate it
was like nope I'm out of it so we're
gonna continue I'm walk-in the canals
and I'm gonna protect my girlfriend from
all these like crazy horny dudes fucking
strange we made away from the red light
district experience experience and think
nice meal nice people that we've met
yeah the hotel rooms really nice and now
it's next step is to go on home go home
go back to the hotel kick it for the
night and then adventure in the morning
it's actually called Kentucky Fried
Chicken rather than
KFC that's weird again not too sure what
that build it is but it's massive I'm
assuming that's the townhall right
because that looks like the town
shopping center this looks like the
that's the senator as the town Cenotaph
has to be and then that's that's some
sort of tree with lights on it I was
waiting Thomas Christmas tree that's a
Christmas tree poorly decorated should
have hired you this place is truly truly
beautiful I love it
I'm so glad we came look at you with
your mouth full whoopee you're so
gorgeous I know that's how I feel about
that and your hat that's tasteless
ladies proper tasteless though oh wow
that was good mm-hmm-hmm
it's not like 1:30 in the morning it is
gray and miserable outside but you know
what what did I say yeah it's 1:30 in
the afternoon may or may not have slept
majority of the goddamn day but you know
what there's still plenty of time
there's 24 hours in a goddamn day so
we're gonna make the most of it right
we're gonna make the most of the rest of
the day we're gonna go out get some
breakfast brunch and then just smash
Amsterdam for the net all day so thank
