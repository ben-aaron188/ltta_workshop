spall Great Gatsby themed and yes I'm

that I didn't want like a walking cane
but I really have one of those Jews kind
of clean
moment of truth dad will the Audi stop
shit there I hope you ready I was a
gingerbread man in the passenger seat yo
look at these lights that we've got from
Costco it's such a good mood lighting
yeah yeah right from driving a Land
Rover Defender to an Audi TT it's it's
like driving a toy car like it's not
even real that the steering wheel so
loose because it's not a big fucking
heavy unit it's just so so weird like so
we I don't know how I feel about it it's
like a ride in a go-kart compared to
tank behind-the-scenes preparation
mm-hmm Go Go howdy Tee tee honestly this
thing is just weird getting into a car
that is this low down it's kind of just
a joke it doesn't even seem real whoo
all right yeah well I didn't expect this
but the traffic senator traffic Center
everyone thought in my comments I was
saying traffic Center the Trafford
Centre is oh wait what there's actually
people on this thing there's more than
there's more than one person on this
thing what the fuck all the times I've
been around like that stupid no one no
one ever uses it any time I've been here
and long behold this is when I bought
the Trafford Centre nut traffic Center
it should be called traffic Center it's
rammed all the spaces are like proper
Paul but I'll give you a pro tip if you
want a park park outside like the front
foodcourt section area and when you pull
up just follow someone rather than
wasting time driving around looking if
you've already looked once the best way
to guarantee yourself a space is just to
follow someone and if you follow him you
say that's why I did it only took me
about 30 seconds to find space when I
pulled into here and we are big blue but
now I still gotta find my suit and
apparently it's absolutely bra we packed
the suit hunting begins so it turns out
the suit jacket I want is on the
mannequins in the window so they're
having to take it off to see if I can
try and wear it so sorry
right I need need need this fitting shop
to be able to fix this by tomorrow oh my
god saw it got them handed in kind of
collect it tomorrow at 12 o'clock now to
try and find a way sue oh my god thank
goodness for that I've got everything I
need for my suit and pants and the
surprise prize which I don't think I
told I don't what it is yet which we'll
see in tomorrow's blog given out at New
Year's Eve or Best Dressed male and
