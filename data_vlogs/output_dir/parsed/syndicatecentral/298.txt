I was supposed to film this anyways so
ladies and gentlemen I did indeed
received a gift of razor which I have no
idea what it is our autumn I could see
something saying syndicate in there but
gonna throw this out and now I'm not too
sure whether this gift is one of the
1337 limited edition ones they do of
things if you like wait what's that - I
raise the employees sponsors like just
friends of the company they'll give away
one item out of a total of 1337 a
reliever a customized headset a
wristband
you know microphone just someone that
they've always done and I think I've
collected it every single wantons are
doing it for four years so don't know if
this is one of them but nonetheless and
it'll open it up because it's got rapid
data so I'm pretty okay so this says
syndicate and all no way no way as if
that's what that actually is
I thought it was a customized backpack
it said it's a razer stocking are you
even oh no way
oh that is so sick and I got some
customized syndicate punches but yes
feels like there's something inside let
me check come on oh wait there is some
inside wait wait come come come come
come come
okay some razor razor like smile M&Ms I
like it I like it what is this what is
this this bin oh is this what I think it
this is what I think it is introducing
the razor fidget spinner and just an FYI
I'm pretty sure that this is a
glow-in-the-dark item so yeah welcome to
the cult of razor we we spin fidgety Oh
like stray oh that's probably one of the
coolest gifts ravers raised razors Arava

alone people will be actually dead and
I'm very glad to be involved I still
working in the races they're an amazing
company to make amazing products and
more importantly they package the best
products in the world like if you've
ever bought anything from raising you
