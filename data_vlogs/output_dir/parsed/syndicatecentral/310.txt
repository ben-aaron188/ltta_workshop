that Bank for half an hour I'm now truly
honestly expecting a parking ticket on
my car parking ticket where is it should

I'm hoping it happened why filled the
bank on the corner of a street with no
parking I was back here

it could to remove but you can fit a
wheel clamp around that good on you he
says before checking his other ties for
we are clumped no we're good we're good
I really took a hella long amount of
time honestly I was in there that long
that people were ringing me like he's

help for those for sponsoring my New
Year's Eve to be fucking six chips

road to where we parked I brought the
defender outside the firework shop

Year's Eve if they hold up to it last
year last year they were nuts and we
didn't spend as much money as we did
last year this year we've gone bigger

so she was gonna stay at home but let me
just show you something we were
struggling with the Christmas tree and
the Christmas lights because they were
terrible like they were not that we did
a terrible job but the lights just
weren't amazing but Lydia saw how much
stress the Christmas tree decorations
and lights were causing us so she went
out she bought decorations I actually
feel like can I cry no just because I I
love her so much I yes I've been
drinking but more importantly I've just
noticed that she's used my Christmas
star I've always had in my house on the
top of the tree but she's decorated the
tree
hey looks amazing she's decorate the
entire tree it looks absolutely
incredible and I just couldn't move
anymore
