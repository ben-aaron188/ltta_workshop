well good morning your being little cute
cat this morning coming saying hello to
me I would say you're also being very
annoying because your bum hole in my
face is not nice go to the dentist at
about an hour and I've been woken up by
a cat thanks appreciate you oh well I
was hoping to dramatic reveal my windows
then but uh it's another day in England
where it's just I see it's not exactly
snowed again so you know that's kind of
disappointing but whoa I have neighbors
what to help people used to live that
kind of moved out they were gone and I
think that is actually not my new
neighbor I think it's just a guy owns
the house like the landlord but also my
cat escaped today look at him oh it was
Trump's outside the house you know how
we go out it just managed to escape and
then my dad just said he at the cottage
door open and all the Canaries alone
Beulah it was Gadsby hiding underneath
my car thanks I rescued him is it here
though is it here is it doing is it
ready my house is one step closer one
step closer to being finished to be
honest you know when you call like cars
like a girl and stuff I don't think you
can call this a girl it's too like
Brutus Derrick but Derrick sounds stupid
so maybe not that do you know I wish we
didn't have if we didn't have all that
you know balustrade there and it was
just rocks going down like a nice garden
you better know I'd be driving it down
onto the grass if I was somewhat friends
with the farmer over there I'd totally
him up remove my fence there and then go
all off-roading in each field but you
managed to sneak out of the house did
you you managed to sneak out of the
house oh my god I have a unit holy shit

wall and let's get ready our kin and
they're all one body to get around to
decorate in this tree as well today

leaving the door open
just now because I don't think the cats
gonna attempt to run outside but I think
you might stay there and just watch what
I'm doing but Oh Oh baby baby baby baby
look at it in the light I was a bit
upset yesterday because when we went to
the showroom obviously it went dark but
it got more and more difficult to show
you it was nice that it was in the
showroom so that really helped out I'm
still hoping that cat doesn't come like
ball in on out but it's here it's mine
it's a beast and I probably don't need
it today like you know it's one of these

what are you doing seem Razi's no it's
shit followed over twice this is vlog
losses remembered so if you guys didn't
know I'd watch my leg yeah perfectly
smooth like a baby's bottom kind of what
you think that's a fine leg it is a fine
leg what comes smooth it is with the
prop there is like hairy patches because
I just like wimped out but the problem
is we film the whole thing in like 4k
60fps gorgeous and then I backed up my
phone and so I could get on my contacts
on because I didn't I've like anywhere
American contacts it anything on my on
this new iPhone X what happened lavend
yeah I lost footage because it backed up
to like six months ago of video footage

unfortunately I did lose a voyage I'm
sorry I apologize I messed up I know
I'll do it again because we didn't watch
this leg so we'll just do it again so
Fred look at us go gone gone down look
easy so this guy right now is Ken Jones
who was to dig a driver Oh like help
build my house like took out like 200
200 tons of stone he dug out himself I
think I carried it open his like little
like machine and stuff boy I used to
have a Land Rover Defender so he's
teaching me now how to mess around with
the 4x4 settings like diff lock lock
differential high-low there's all
different sorts of settings
look at this ladder over squad I said
hey look at the Aces good collection
that's in it there's a little gang this
is in low crawl mode so like even if we
didn't torch the accelerator you just
keep going in 4x4
just like you do it in only I have my
own off-roading course at the top of my
Road so right now what Gary in here
normal gear Street gears like I can ride
on the rodeo but we're gonna then switch
it into
this engine now is set up in low low
crawl mode so he's just choking along
like with all the power but I loved
about this little lanes light up the top
of my road it's like a proper little off
for offroad costing me to practice on it
I need to find out who owns this field
put your asses into hibernation let me
rip around in me Jeep so it's just it
I'm and now no thanks to Ken's help
thank you very much Jeff that old
legends must be called ken my dad yeah
like whoa now is I know what I should be
driving it on the road and then when I'm
off-roading
to have it in a unlocked gear
differential is I've been in death you
so I can turn easier when I'm on the
road and have it in walk you sort of on
green lanes and stuff it's just all the
wheels are like clawing along at the
same time and then I can obviously
accelerate pick up a bit of speed then
change my gaze depending on like what
saw a grittiness I've gotta get through
so we've learned of a load well Ken to
do well thank you that's just hope I
don't hit this old woman now so my job
boy are the grass
how do will learning okay okay I did try
and do this in the camera be impossible
with there you can do this in the car
good
he's finally got a better Madonna she
should have some scratches as well from
the tree that I just drove past no baby
but there's something like I'm like
anything's gonna get scratches you know
it should get scratches this vehicle was
designed for off-roading and you know
what it's gonna do in my lifetime with
me it's gonna go off-roading like they
said this car came from London it was
bought as a brand new defender don't
know I was getting in the room they
brought this from London like new did it
all and it's never really seen any
off-road in its life the the gearbox to
turn it into like off-road gear had
never been touched so we're set
well I legend finally what it did my
first bit of opera did it I know to you
guys like that might not see a bit of
Road it was more of a track that we
actually went on and drove down and it
was super fun super awesome it's just
nice because you know again a lot of
people were like oh you probably won't
use it offroad and first of all I don't
give a shit what you say it's I mean
what to do with my life person on the
Internet I do what I want when I want
how I want it and you know what if I'm
gonna drive it round all day in there in
this Sun with the windows down then
that's what I'm gonna do if I'm gonna
get it off in the snow and ice from fun
with it that's what I'm gonna do if I
can take it to somewhere with a desert
and see what it's like in a desert I'm
gonna do it know that there's any
deserts in England but you know I don't
know what he call Sun Sun juninho I'd
love to go do that but yeah she's a
beast
she's an absolute beast I get a 10 thank
you very much I will go off-road in it
one day I'll give you a helmet and offer
olden what you don't what you know what
you do what you do okay what's the door
before you open it it's all right watch

yeah can I can now I got the new toy I
got it Tara
check out rody
what do you think guys she can I know is
proper filthy alright in it
god damn I wrote him like three seconds
god damn it mate we need to do a photo
shoot with this and the syndicate
regional club farmer excuse me your
former I just got a poor play so I can
connect my phone to it like maps and
stuff comes upon it so most of them
don't usually have that but actually
none of them have that everything was
like CD player some other that is that
much they respond she's doing well do
you think do you like it wait you mean
you're accidentally otherwise cuz I was
just about to fill my oh my God look how
good these are but this is that if you
order something from siddik original you
get one of these with your order oh my
god yeah I'm gonna sign I don't I don't
sign every single one but if you order
it within the next like what a few days
I'm gonna need to move it why does
everyone I and just get in well that was
obvious I was walking someone in there I
should really just park in that spot but
parked on the road instead but yeah so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna sign like
a bunch of these so if you order
anything from now until Friday you're
pretty much gonna get the chance to get
one of these signed you've got one week
if you want to get some ordered in the
UK for Christmas so there you go look at
that like Sam you crushed it made you
just crushed it we were gonna sell them
on the front book anyway that you're
right can it takes away from the detail
of it so we sign it like a proper letter
look how good that looks
Oh still signing I'm still so look at it
mate it looks so good like I'd love to
have sign not again like I said but that
just looks so good it looks like a
proper letter
what you saying what you say
why well what if I were to water someone
I get it in time for Christmas when's
the final day so as long as they get
their order in before the 19 yeah it
will get the little bit crispy the only
reason it won't come cheese because of
something to do with Royal Mail or the
delivery service knows there you go
so 19 yeah night 8:00 let's get a
description syndicate original dot-com
grab your swag I was opening for you to
say now boy you'd kind of despaired she
still didn't jump back in the shop dummy
she's a changed woman
yeah I was like sign like a few of these
I've signed the entire pile not every
single night every single order will get
a signed one bought again if you're
ordering from now you've got very high
chance of actually game one again a lot
of people lost often like say hey Tom
can you sign this for us
no I'm always like why do people want my
signature like it's a potato one however
this is probably the best-looking thing
I've ever signed not just a poster but
the there it just looks great like Sam
you crushed it mate you absolutely
crushed it I'm just thinking about this
right now
I'm sorry I'm not streaming on switch on
in in forever I'm hoping to get back on
it ASAP so let's see how that goes

discount deal if you buy that because
it's got the Royal sure I you're
terrible business company this is me put
in the first-ever postcard in two curls
Penfold this is now gone in your box and
you know what once again the snapback

this as a Christmas present we just
bought it but child ya know we're in the
surprises but Charles it's on its way
it's in the box it's and still
delivering sign seal delivery as I need
to know just as an FYI by the way I have
to say probably hands down my fate my
favorite t-shirt of this year has been
the insignia that's a fact
insignia is a fact the hoodie is dog
like but my favorite my favorite
crewneck is definitely the kanji like
this is the sickest jumper ever like I
really love this I know it's like my
merch stomp organ it but like I'm always
plugging it I never but like this is my
favorite if you want my if you want my
favorite one this is it
James Paul James Paul you mean Jake Paul
it's actually Logan Paul I actually
watch Logan
Logan's breathing good oh I guess due to
Allah sees demand if you now order one
of these posters you have the chance of
one of them being signed it a quite a
few so if you want to grab one you can
I'm actually gonna kick back now what
Georgie was gonna watch me I'm gonna
play it that people say like took Tom
you should just respectful to your
family I sound like I'm like Jupiter on
the negativity but I just love the
comment like just shit you're off you
should do phone call interrupted me you
sure you officer you do know if you must
they do all the hard work mate listen
here I employ these guys and pay them a
salary in a wage to do the work that I
do yeah I pay them a salary slash wage
to do the work so I don't have to but
more importantly rather than go on
employing some random person entire
Payne Taipan or whatever I'll some
random other business doing it and I
that we don't know the control the
quality the customer service rating we
do it as a family business and we get to
hire them and because of the business I
get to see these guys nearly every
single day and you like that do you like
your job yeah I seem like a real answer
oh my god that's a lot of damn orders
bloody hell thank somewhat right now
this was a really good purchase for me
like I can't find the exact page now but
there's like places of where it shows
you like where to buy like you know roof
racks from snorkels all like good
equipment all I upgrades for it and
stuff like that different wheels
different tyres different rims like this
is probably one of the best like you
know what did they call it like coffee
coffee book take coffee table read
there's a proper saying that they call
these kind of books when it's just there
it's like you know what when you're in a
shop and you're at the dentist and it's
just there for you to eat it's like you
know a flick through it boy I just keep
this on the side every time I go through
it I might find something pretty cool
I can end up throwing on the defender so
now that I've got myself a coffee table
on I can put it on it yeah that's
exactly what I want light bar there but
instead of it being there I wanted to
run straight across the top look at
these things they just look like
monsters are you walking oh look a
little bubble coat
let's take on my teaser starting to wear
off I was hoping to like maybe stream

getting together for a drink

context here is Lydia is a teacher and
her best friend who she used to live
with who now also works with at her
primary school where she works
moved into the estate that's newly built
round the corner from me so this guy
might be seen in the vlogs from now on

I hate I hate this sort of shit but we
went into the walk around that other
house around the corner but then these
guys actually bought the show house and
like finisher and everything like I
actually a little because Lydia and
Tasha are best friends so it's just like
