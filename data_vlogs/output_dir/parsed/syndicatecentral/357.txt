lose it but then a Suzy tries and
catches it until he's like a little
Honda and that is in full control of the
kittens right now I sadly just cannot
seem to get this microphone working with
this camera I really don't know why

says it's not compatible with other
models from Canon but this one shouldn't
be a problem but I just can't get it
going whatsoever this still I cry every

hundred boom battery's gone out you
can't make it up he reversed it all the
way to here absolutely fine we thought
he was good and my phone battery was
dead stuck on record I said we thought
he was about to get out the car
he reversed into the wall he actually
hit the brick wall I'm hoping it was
just a tap and there's no damage yeah
well he didn't knock the wall over it
wasn't like a crazy
reverse the bumper no just just
scratched it in a bit on it you'll
survive with that he'll be fine
to be fair that parking lot to park up
in is absolutely awful however it was in
a big open space and for some reason
reversed into it his reverse cameras
were going me me me me me to stop even I
wouldn't stop the car
Alice is apparently the queen of
frustration but the queen of losing
Alice has got to get two out and it's
drawn out between whether or not I get a
one already gets a one if she gets it
first cuz she's ahead of me then she
wins by one space so why in the
meanwhile Alice can roll six and get us
out right let him go
if I get one now I think we should I
think what you're doing equal vote right
now he's between being Atlas like oh
she's not stopping I think it's a race
if I get a one or Alice kisses oh you
what are you doing are you quit all
right okay I need anyone to it's between
whether or not I get another go I got
another well I got another go right it's
between it whether Alice can get sick so
