same one that time see if I can win a

bonus 50 to win Oh 90 I saw the on the

god this is going through me why is that

even looked if I've got any matching one
I need a car a watch rings Bank ship
that um I honestly don't think out of
all those bloody symbols I've got that
I've won one single one well that was a
waste of ten pounds thanks for watching
and I'm gonna cry now
welcome to hide this is the home of the
you know what I don't actually know what
hide his home of but it does have a post
office I need to take this collection
note to go and get my package there you
go this is a package from West base
electronics this could be what I think
it is or it could be completely
something different you know throw that
away second box also has absolutely
nothing in it so that one right and last
but not least
yes there it is that is what I wanted a
day a digital night vision with zoom
scope hahahaha I could not wait tease
that tonight alright so I was saying a
second ago what is hyde known for so the
hide is like my local town but what is
it known for its it's actually difficult
to put my finger on because well there
was dr. Shipman there was a guy who
murdered like a hundred people over
there and then over than that the Moors
murderers lived not too far from Hyde
but other than that I really don't know
we have a Sally don't know that is a
jack full turn we have music movies buy
sell exchange of a shoe zone other than
that we have a pound world obviously we
have a lot of sick to them there is
actually one thing that we do have that
you might know we have a Gregg's and you
better know it's the best sausage roll
in town finally made the point what's it
called for GE Rooter for my house to see
if it works at the if it's not fast
enough it's dope I can bring it back but
this is why I'm getting this little bar
buying and it should technically fix my
job but yeah I'm not good with that 18
month contract I'll bring it back in two
days I'll bring it back in two hours if
he doesn't work that's why though I
swear to God I'm a maximus T Thomas if
you don't know all that is it's me I
went down to go and pick up my night
vision monocular my nut monocle or
whatever you want to call it Monica I
went picked it up got it ready to lead I
decided to go into EE they had what I
want it I'm gonna go test it now set it
up and see if it works but what did I do
whilst I'm talking to them guys I left
my bloody night-vision monocle monocular
an exam an ocular left it on the fuck
inside in EE I just rang them back and
I'm like leave my nitrogen glasses there
and they just said yes so I have to go
back down after I finished setting this
up to see if it works I think so alright
so you see this this is basically a
broadband roofer and you might be like
what but in some people's houses they
don't have telephones they don't have
landline telephones which is what you
need to be able to have the phone in
your house and Internet in your house
but what mobile phone companies did was
go well why don't we just use SIM cards
inside a router to be able to get the
internet owned lo and behold they
created this little bad boy which is
exactly a whole route
but using a mobile phone SIM card in the
side of it rather than a formal charge
on it will plug down while riding on
rockin is this actually on it says power
let's just turn on anything I don't
actually know right it's plugged on
don't know how long this sector where's
my manual got the manual why would I
have to do maybe this is safety warranty
that's not manuals connect the power
adapter done connect an ethernet cables
done now I have to do power button oh
it's turned on okay network oh it's a
signal signals on low signals I'm two
bars oh yeah alright well that's not
good though ku wanted to be on three
bars but my signal right now is on low
so so well it was worth the shot bought
unfortunately my upload speed is not
what it was supposed to be so I cry we
tried we have to take it back was not
successful I cry even after try and send
it open my other room and then what I
actually would have doing is left on the
windowsill in their pod Ethernet cable
going all the way through or even
knocked a hole in the wall for a cable
the internet speeds are just they're
terrible it was worth a shot I wasn't
expecting it to be the best result in
the world book series all sometimes my
phone's like I get 20 upload on my phone
I was like man if I even get 10 that'd
be great boy I try to be testing a few
times and I was getting like to upload
and stuff so it was worth to try
unfortunately it just didn't pan out so
taking this back to the shop and go and
get in my night-vision goggles so
there's one good things come out today
it's that my garden looks absolutely
gorgeous the guy did a great job with
that but time to go down to the post
office return this and get my
night-vision goggles okay it just really
sucks because I've got the fastest
internet I can in my actual area which
is like yeah that's the fastest I can
get but my office it's in the original
has the exact same the exact same
Internet and they get twice the speeds
of me which is what I need if I even had
just twice to speed that up here we'd be
finding you wouldn't hear me complain
I'd be streaming all the timing like 4k
it be gorgeous but no I can't do it
because I'm one Street over literally
over that Street is the office and
because they're one Street over they
have five or speeds
I'm one Street over this way I can get
fiver speeds we can tick it off the list
as saying we tried but we failed the
next one is
eighteen grand a year inter that's
supposed to be for the cats that was
sent to us by remember this is Joey Oh
Pikachu sorry I can't really read your
name on that book I just get write lies
24th day before the pre oats clothes
can't wait to see you Lydia Gadsby
reaction to the magic app all right like
I still have to take that home where is
he what other he'll the cats do oh yeah
I feel like a I feel like a reggae hips
hippy
wow that's great did she can't make this
one no way that's way too details
another busy day at the office I'm
liking it was actually really nice again
as well I was not expecting this after
that hurricane I thought it's gonna be
raining for days but when there's rain
they'll come sunshine fun fact about
this place this building here my dad
used to live on the top floor that's
when he was young getting on top of the
marketplace how crazy is that what a
random item told you behind a
night-vision goggle truly got it
returned it like within an hour got it
straight back in told him it didn't work
they refunded it for me it's good if you
can test it in your area and it works
for you but if you don't have a lawn
line then that's the perfect replacement
for it but no signal in my area was good
enough so unfortunately I'm now leaving
with a return receipt and a night-vision
goggle ticket on my car please don't
please no I do have to really say thank
you to Edo because if most companies do
tie you into contract and I want you're
saying it you've signed it but luckily
they were like our return policy is if
your internet speeds not good enough
then you know you can just bounce
straight away old employees who we want
new goodbye forever we love you
nice t-shirt John well I got my money
back don't have money dongle box anymore
is that it that was at last time using
the office you sent out all of them
they caught a wire that was hanging
loose just walking around
that's the night vision one dude this
looks sick introducing the Bushnell
night vision Akron ox said this thing
has the ability to record and take
photos which I really don't care about
even though it would be quite cool but
what I've tried it already is in this
room but it's got like a zoom so like
say like when you look through this
rather than it being like right then you
go from looking through it now it
doesn't look like that you can't see the
whole room all you can see is like that
dead zoomed in I really don't like that
did not say that on the packaging that
I'd like a magnified zoom straight away
so I'm actually not sure that I'm gonna
send it back this is just been a day of
sending things back and I'm not quite
happy about that but i'ma try it in the
night time see how it is and you never
know it might be really good it might be
really potato so until I can test out
the night vision capabilities I'm gonna
keep it
you like the London vlog I think grand
another good time it's not there you
have it all the sheep are gone and you
know what that means they all been
turned into lump chops well that are you
know they could have gone and got
sheared or something but oh my god a
unicorn fucking horse

a lot of pop figures and that isn't even
all of them this is them and then I've
