nice try God hashtag raisin products
because they just sent me stuff all the

was oh I need this so badly right now
because my cats a lot bastards keep
attacking the cable from my computer to
my headset so if this is actually one I
can use then that set now does say Xbox

sponsored user sorry Josh
the 14th of September their journey of
the Forgotten the journey of the
Forgotten oh I thought it was the junior
for they've forgotten she
right in what is the first word say
window ruse wonderous emerald green fire
wondrously emerald green firework
explosion shooting dazzling in the clear
style check your kids being creatively
beautiful with their words don't be
nicely unboxed it and see what it looks
like now don't get me wrong there's a
headset on the fourth hand which I
thought might be them but attempt it's
almost say this is them because raises
sent me these headphones like a couple
of months ago and said don't announce
what they are just wear them on stream
if you won but don't say what then I was
like okay then so what have been doing
and they're impeccably good I mean as a
fact
like these the old manner was that I
used to wear and they're really good but
these are more basic and they're really
good just like but these are how much
took on these are more bassy compared to
the to the to these bad boys which again
I'm not too sure what they are and so
let's check if these are the same ones
or just Xbox drop to xbox themed razor
packaging as always he's just got oh my
god it's just beautiful man bye I'm
assuming that yes this is indeed the
same see I like this ones theme for Xbox
because it's got green on it and this
one's fully black so I don't know if I
got sent like a limited edition one
there but let's take a look at this oh
my god so beautiful oh oh yes bro these
are gorgeous audio I'm actually thinking
that this might finally even what it
looks like it looks like a big Ricky's a
key that's perfect but this might
finally allow me to replace now raising
oh I have this but this is an astral
headset mix amp now I think that this
even though this has got a turntable on
it I think this might be a new form of
mix a volume rocker on this side that
you can turn up and down there is a
microphone adjuster on this side for
threshold
you've got the charging unit you power
and you got your microphone that pops
out of it and is it comfy it's hella
comfy this is the exact
this is like the exact same one as this
one which for for a fact is dumb comfy
like I've won this head south in what
the other day streaming like 12 hours

used to wear like the Rays of Krakens
