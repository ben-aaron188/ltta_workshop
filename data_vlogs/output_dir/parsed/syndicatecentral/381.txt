twin this is a 2012 this brand bloody
new look at that Jesus that's a true
old-school door looking at this is such
a good sure this is what you call a
hospitality suite you've got a kitchen
to cook your food and a fridge full of
champagne and drinks that is not bad at
all what can a school there's only 22 of
the Twix two of these versions of the
car in the world and grandeur this is
like 1.8 million
what you got sushi got some saving up to

Oh bye oh hello you two just fuck off
oh come on I got you new bed
come downstairs oh you're hungry wait
hey who's gonna notice the bed first
here is it gonna be none
what's this what's that Wow comfy new
bed look at that okay look at the cause
Oh you much kind of is perfectly random
adventure eat on time um you know I keep
walking for like Lund everywhere and
stuff well when I was in a bike ride
quite some time ago I saw I want one and
I'm a factory mother I do a factory
because there's like 20 floors on it you
get like a hundred eight hundred hundred
thousand foot of space I'm basically
matter which is the place just to have
like my own but fantasy factory like
just do whatever I want in it so there's
a place that I know that just burnt down
and I was terrible but I'm gonna try and
see but kind of look around it I think
is abandoned all right I already I don't
think you'll be able to make it down
this road and so I could have to run
that what an idiot
yo look at this I'm pretty sure this
place has been bought for like you know
apartments or whatever but then if I'm
right in thinking so it burnt down like
it was a fire whilst it was something
like a massive fire and I don't whether
the insurance paid out or not because
the roof looks like it's been fixed
rather than just being left to shit but
this this right here I don't know how
long I'm fresh does this look not very
to be honest so I don't know if they're
like doing still shit loads of work on
it or not doing
I guess people don't agree with you the
no trespassing sign
oh yeah what you can see all the funny
damage not too sure what's going on over
there and if you ever looked a bit
further down I'm pretty sure in saying
it's been abundant but look at all this
land you get all this internal hunde Wow
look at that
god damn so much space so much goddamn
space and this is like two minutes down
the road from me I just don't know
what's happening with the building like
obviously it's burned down and they've
concrete it up the windows so people
don't go in but I'm pretty sure a viewer
of mine tweeted me a photo of this and
then climbing inside and on the ruse and
stuff
luckily four stories of just madness is
probably got a basement as well
this is fucking sick hey this thing is
massive if it goes all the way down here
Wow this is a project to have this now
buying a property like this makes
complete sense to turn into lights and
stuff but you can see where people are
kicked it in I don't know if they like
went to rob the place or whatever when
it burned down like to salvage matters
of a book like this walls been kicked
through
there must just be like people looking
for puffer that may have been installed
or something look at the size of the
back of it oh my god there's so much
lund it's buildings probably falling
down don't get all fucking how this
looks creepy
no I hope that looks bogged down ass got
a basement oh you've got a big-ass
basement
I'd love to walk around this at
nighttime and by that I mean no I
wouldn't but it would make for a funny
video
let me crappy myself it's got like an
outdoor Garret this place is yeah me
look at this for scale all this land
here for like parking or put in an
outdoor go-cart track on it or some like
that you've got this outside building
over a and yeah it looks like the aviary
replace the roof probably to stop water
going into it don't know what they're
doing with it this would soak up I don't
what don't judge versus we're young but
this building would just be a money SAP
it would like to even do up like say
that one building alone let alone them
buildings would be ridiculous but
imagine buying this doing it up running
the syndicate regional clothing from
here like I could use every building
it's like a project or whatever I want
it in it sounds random by just one lund
and there's no neighbors either side to
annoy alter distraught I'm pretty sure
there's a canal on the back of it so you
know I felt like putting like a boat in
there or a jetski just one time I've
been around that'd be pretty sick God
absolutely a little bit to pieces I
don't on how long it spinning itself
like all this graffiti on it but this is
so sick Wow whatever is over here they
really didn't want anyone coming inside
to dick this time they thought that they
didn't even bother breaking it up they
just put these huge huge things unless
unless this building by the looks of
things might be falling down so for
insurance purposes
they put all this into stuff people
climb in it oh I guess that's how people
got in spooky spooky and I'm guessing
the entrance this is oh my god it's
actually kind of scary like it's so
eerie
Wow graffiti got really big big and a
day they broken up on the wall die live
oh no it's like an underground section
looks like nature's reclaiming its
ground Charlie Charlie are you WS what
gold Nova wait isn't that Bella strike
this is like some of the worst graffiti
I've actually ever seen in my life but
see that is what people probably came to
take this is copper pipe that they could
probably sell but the Illuminati's been
a Oh
big-ass penis looks like an electric
board building this month for sure
like this is how the stack is underneath
the staircase he's hella creepy but even
this one outside garage section of this
entire building invite ten times the
size of my house already
oh this like don't get me wrong this is
probably strong enough to keep it
together but this place looks like he's
gonna fall apart any second
oh this is daddy's ninja bar by that
Jesus that's aggressive I think I can
play that ecology zombies mouth power
cable box
I don't even know what that graffiti
means yo that's major extraction funds
there for air I'd love to see the inside
in this bit I see if there's a door see
what I mean like just to fix this room
along with the roof would just cost you
this probably belt probably underground
to fix this room and this is maybe 150th
of the entire building wonder if it
started in here because like that
doesn't burn like all this building and
all this building kind of does that's a
bit of a shame it looks like they were
doing a lot of work on it and then he
just went all tits up I wonder if it was
like burned down on purpose by some no
beds oh it was just an accident
either way everything returns to the
earth proper check out how big so about
ten penises on my way past
well outhouse up here this is bigger
than my house I may talk about a factory
of this size and this little outhouse I
found it's huge this would truly be a
life goals property it's genuinely not
far at all from my house it's two
minutes down the road from my house he's
got so much London there's no one to
disrupt there's a bunch of land with it
but you could probably if you were to
make a track like a gold cassimy or an
outdoor trap all the way around the
house like Gymkhana style and over you
like don't expect me to get this project
done in five years this would be a
lifetime project but you can make a look
dope ass out house out of this you can
either like rent one of the falls for a
paintball arena somewhere you can make
an outhouse on it you could have family
here you could build a garage here like
you can have such a nice Parkway
driveway here
yeah I just looked projects I know it
might sound oh boy I wouldn't play
Minecraft I didn't do well at like
building a house from scratch and work
with something that I previously found
like I'd dig into the ground and then
make an epic bunker on the ground I like
I like working with someone that already
exists I'm here exploring this building
I come out and I'm like macao strapped
in by someone else I thought it's the
owner of the factory
turns out these lads you also do YouTube
channels got a fucking drone they've
already been through it on the top floor
and all that sort so they're wearing
jeans and light shoes and everything
like that bro fucking Shores so they've
already been through it now they've got
a drone back for some epic shots fellow
