holiday this has been what a beautiful
month this has been I've got I've got
gets a train station now in trouble a
train like 57 minutes takes the air for
then I've got an 11 hour journey home
the tiredness is real if you're ever in
Japan that place is a dope dope ass
ramen spot I'm gonna give that a nine
point eight hour ten I guarantee I get
the wrong train okay I love you dude
stay safe look oh okay Kenny - I say
another tom has been so awesome like I
said
Ray's a hired Tom as their translator
for the work that they were doing and
then he just decided to just hang out
with us because he's been friends with
like kion and Travis since they were
like teenagers you know went to same
school but were like two years apart
from each other so the fact that you
stayed and kicked it around is amazing
and now to know that I've got a contact
in Japan
I'm just gonna hope that this is the
right one I'm not under censure but you
know what we're just gonna go for it I
believes are made to my destination yep
and put rapid service thank God I got
the right drink Tom you're a legend
thanks for not letting me miss it
however it is now if you can see the
time nope you can't it is now to get
through security and on my flight Forte
in terminal 1 international am I going
nah but am I going south let's find out
I see Lufthansa so I'm assuming yep
North
all right ahead I'm assuming this is the
right place and then fingers crossed I
might be able to get an upgrade probably
won't be too expensive
I'll befall port we'll try
oh good I couldn't get business class
upgrade but I did get like a three new
economy I was really looking forward to
doing the business part it's all about
so I must begin on the plane if I can
upgrade but for now a back premium also
if you're wondering why this is so
important it's like an 11 hour flight so
oh it's trying to sleep right the entire
way I apparently had two pairs of
tweezers in my bag and I was like I'm
for sure I got one because I did have
one and then will be hope they found it
on the x-ray and the tweezers with that
sharp that when I went looking for it in
my bag it caught me so understandably
yeah it's one of those you like where
you're like oh don't be so pain it's
just a pair of tweezers but I was like
you know if I've got a pair of tweezers
in now and they said the to shadow and
fire get rid of him
but I I was convinced I had a sharp pair
like a fine point like set but then I
also like a flat head set and I was like
the other one she said he's either set
the shop was like now and it got stuck
in a secret pocket in my bag so when he
was stuck in the secret pack of a bag
she was like it's in there so I was like
okay so put my fingers to put my finger
into it like I stabbed it oh no got a
little plaster I can go okay I've got to
go through immigration
I've got runs watch on it's clearly not
set at the right time and then hopefully
I'm going to make my plane
and see how that's the size of the plane
I expected the flight chirps if Japan on
the first time I'm not like one of them
tiny planes
someone dropped out of business class
like an upgrade next step I am thankful
let's get this funded mmm good on
Lufthansa
if someone has a business seat but then
doesn't get on the plane safety seats
empty and you wanna upgrade you can't
they won't let yourself there's like
four or five empty business class seats

clean

be one let's go there's my destination
I'm just at 23 how's about getting
McDonald's but then I walked in here and
saw all this it was like oh yes lobster
crayfish you help me with some caviar
and a little glass of champagne this is
the perfect coming meal I literally
wouldn't last people on the plane just
because there was a delay due to
sickness there so the thing is you can
watch people stand up in queue like
idiots and wait as long as you want but
when they say final board you have to
get past that checkpoint because pretty
sure that's my captain right there
because as soon as you get past that
point they close that gate this is
always cramped
see you soon Manchester it will not be
long before I am home you know what
being when I fly
might not actually see my house if I see
it I'll make sure to zoom in on Kim the
Sunni old Lanchester sorry guys

the roof until you it's just so so
pleasant to be back in Manchester what

cat loves football
