apples into this
I want to say I know the words but yeah
well that is a perk of the job I just
realized cuz I've got silver membership
with British Airways me and Joe can go
for a fast ride and the reason that
saved me and Joe is because I get to
take a plus-one with me so yeah well
that's convenient

chopsticks time sofa silver chopsticks
with his name on it and he can walk into
any Wagga members and eat for free
