okay so before today's vlog actually
gets into it I just want to say if
you've got your GCSE results today and
you're happy with it then that's great
if you're not happy with it it's the end
of the world and all that sort of stuff
you're falling apart around you then
take a breath relax and just chill a
second because everyone needs to needs
to understand that not everything
realize around grades yes it is very
important to get good grades bought his
Cal he didn't get good grades look at
him
okay look at him he said he's a
professional adult bump and he's still
doing well for himself
Oh Cal what do you have to say to people
who with their grades today and you
happy with them great if not don't worry
about it just make sure you graft even
had yeah Confucius all you need to do
yeah live one more thing opens then you
get to go back to you teachers who
doubted you and say pride wife what do
you have to say like I actually did well
in my GCC's and I was really happy with
it I went did electrical engineering and
then I went and did ICT because after I
decided I want to do electric
engineering as soon as I started my
first day they were like algebra
I was like no so I ended up bouncing
from that and then moving into
programming game design and then
obviously my YouTube choked off and I've
been doing that for seven years
what oh it's two hours and 15 minutes to
get there oh shit but honestly it is
important to do well in your grades and
all that sort of stuff but there is many
different paths you can go down in life
whether it's you know going to college
with with low grades and then resetting
your GCSEs there unfortunately you know
you have to reset them and and dedicate
more time and more energy into it but
once you get them done you can get on
the right path that you want to be in
life and you know even if you messed up
you might want to be like education is
just not for me and move forward into a
different path so you never know if you
do end up saying you know go working at
McDonald's work yourself up to a
management role if you're working at a
close to work yourself up to a
management role you know there's all
these other things that you can move
into that don't require these sort of
results that you were hoping for or you
know had to get something like that so
just don't stress it's not the end of
the world
just take the next step in the right
direction and everything should go well
for you so that's a look I hope you got
what you want if you didn't it's not
there
the world just focus and get but
starting this day properly with a
five-star toothbrush wash well you know
about that shit yeah that's that's what
gets me excited to start my day I get up
shower brush my teeth if I get five
stars it's a good day
rocking the Insignia shirt today and if
you were wondering what the hell was
that noise earlier let me show you
currently have somebody fitting brand
new curtains in my office check this out
look how nice these bad boys get out
first of all they look beautiful
second of all these will really help
with dampening and also light so like
obviously I've got my blinds but they're
kind of potato but look at this I can
now dump in the room sound you can even
tell it straight away even though the
doors open dampens the sound in the room
so much more and obviously looks
absolutely gorgeous they're looking
really good as well and weren't shown
the coolest of what the first one we
picked I'd like I think had been
discontinued but that looks really good
thanks man you're like you like the
fairy of the house you like just come in
and maybe magic wand they started to
call you a fairy there but you know
magic my magic fairy brilliant oh how
nice this looks this room truly does
shut this door now this room actually
sounds so damp it sounds like like
there's there's no echo whatsoever in
this room now hello hello oh this room
it's so close to achieving its final
form
I'm getting my AC unit as you can see no
that's a it's a fire alarm my AC whole
unit I'm getting that changed to a
bigger system so it comes more called
there and it cuz when I've got my
screens going my computer going my like
lump on it everything that this room
gets so damn hot and I'm just sweating
my tits off so I'm getting a grill put
in for AC in here so this room should be
absolutely perfect I'm sorry not me as
we speak so fingers crossed the BT guy
manages to fix that today as well as
everything's looking pretty damn good oh
it's an organized canidate vlog is
uploading right if six o'clock hasn't
got a title hasn't got a thumbnail but
we'll worry about that later the
curtains in this room are looking nice
this go into one bedroom looking also
very nice and then in this bedroom
looking that wow it really does make a
room feel like a room having curtains
got there good looking cut the blackout
curtains might not look it because the
color but the are blackout cone so when
my guests go over now oh actually that
doesn't look like a blackout curtain
what the fuck either way I've got I've
got blind so you could put the blinds
down both these blinds lighting so much
light on their own so with the curtains
now it will do so much of a better job
so yeah it really actually does make the
room feel like a room I'm so happy with
that choice the railings that went for
are beautiful these are like grown-up
decisions you have to make of do I have
curtains in rooms and it's like I don't
