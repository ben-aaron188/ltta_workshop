zip up Hoodie I look my over like the
overthrow hood is like the jumper
hoodies I love them love them greatly
but we need to do is little one do you
agree Mexico where you have just a
simple plain black jumper for looking
sleek looking like no you're just just
nice and you know presentable on a night

into a quote you're going out for meal
and you just want to be like playing
okay okay Plain Jane then this is is the
jump read shows also for the record I
thought I was like a pretty normal sized
dude but I went into all things trying
to jumper a medium way too big I tried
on a jump it in small way too big I had
to wear an extra small I'm basically
wearing children's clothes right now I
 you not
extra oh oh oh what are you doing focus
extra small Oh what what is that I then
decided hey what if I end up going to
like a or woman's house and want to try
and flirt with her or something I need
something that's going to make us feel
comfortable so that's my description of
this junker so I decided to get this
nice I want to take cottony weaving
style jumper and you know it's it's not
too thick it's not too heavy it can
lightweight and looks like I'm putting a
parachute on god this is what I ended up
getting so it's just like a nice nice
little jumper looks kind of neat looks
kinda nice and yeah then you'll know if
that was the clothes that I wear
everything pretty much monotone I don't
really like cause if it wasn't very
obvious that I don't like color take a
look at my house grey grey grey grey
black white silver chrome that's it Oh
another example go up dark table black
chairs grey carpet silver grey sofa I
don't know why that's the case it just
is and wait
even though outside patio slates great
bricks and then
more great violife great hot tub cover
great windows i really should add color
to tomorrow actually the only one
colorful thing in my house is you could
say this but that's kind of monotone in
my in my regards but the only colorful
thing in my house is this painting or
canvas from Ikea which I've had for
about five years my Robinson fruit juice
