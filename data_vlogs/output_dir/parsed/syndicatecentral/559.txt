all right along with all helps I'm
trying in your style I'm trying to tell
it all today so we'll see how things go
I never use a hairdryer I'm driving my
hair so it's all like fluff it flop it
and I'm going to spoil it like this and
that I'm just going to throw some
turning guys dialing put in the guys
what two different like told you
basically do like one of them get ready
with me or something and the answer is
possibly what is this notices possibly
yet because I don't know how honest are
but I do try and roll the wax in
everywhere I've got way too much but I
just try and put it everywhere monster
and now it should just be a messy look
which no one me one extra thing that I
like to do is like scrub a towel to buy
all the jellies ever in my sinks in my
hair so to get our glow and it's all
like proper flippy and then you can just
tie it down in which I'm directing you
wanna know what I like that oh you're on
my hair is way still too long for the
size of my actual pea head but you know
what do I just feel like growing it give
a key a key right did I see let's find
it what neither sent me right what on
earth could they have actually given me
right so it's obviously clothing bought
they hooked me up a Croma Black Widow ye
OB DTM I say that because it comes with
this like wrestling for your arm which
this on its own is worth its weight in
gold but this is where we go we don't
care about the keyboard all we care
about is this you ready sight that this
comes now when you buy a keyboard like
this is incredible just pull that tab
out and you can test it I think it's
like when it's in the shops you know for
people to build the presses so you feel
what the actual keyboard you like so far
back but then you actually if you hold
it you can see the chord change pretty
cool right it's a gearing okay so first
t-shirt is going to be hopefully
something that condors the adware
overcome this bag like I said yes they
feel so so satisfied oh I've got this is
this a for gamers by gamers t-shirt it
is a far game with my gaming t-shirts
peel gotta go as great as this is it's
such a satisfying feeling to touch this
like I almost lose my breasts
I don't understand what is that that
thing when you feel something you kind
of like lose your breath okay next is
going to be I'm just this into the fall
game is by gamma t-shirt okay oh yes I
like that like um I don't know how to
describe it like a bold sticky-out razer
logo Oh
again amazingly feel feeling t-shirt is
it got like a name for this just as
Razer t-shirt oh yeah it's got like and
but a bold and button is what you call
that where it's sticking up but not
least probably the thing I'm most
excited for a razer Jackie okay okay oh
I like it I like it
not going to hold it nice and clean
simple swim pool I just made up a would
take a look all right let's hope let's
hope we've got the siding right I can't
even get it wrong but I kind of like
this style jacket anyway so you know
what ah ah ah it is perfect
girls er oh yeah I'm a fun that they
something I would definitely wear it's
one men like you know company thing
you're like called and a support I mean
you just like but this yeah definitely
also Luke you can go fuck yourself when
my dad came and stayed out here in Los
Angeles at my apartment with Gail he
brought his dog round to my apartment
and I was just like that's a rat but now
my suede sofa is completely covered in
dog hairs everywhere so yeah thanks mate
I like the t-shirt I like the jacket I
love the keyboard absolutely a little
bit but by far the best thing Razer has
ever sent me without a doubt is a Razer
portion just look at it it's adorable
responsible adult in taken care of
disinfecting wipes for your kitchen
surfaces hey man if it can clean a
kitchen surface it can clean a screw you

wander and try to find a restaurant some
breakfast even though it is one o'clock

sir II recommend with who might be in
the area ever over here I got a juice
drink which is called the Californian
orange grapefruit pomegranate Cecilia
and tangerine au pair first try
nice kind of bit interest in functions
to be quite honest I'm going to go for
anything right now anything can either
chicken wing all chicken gone wrong this
we have definitely not was expecting but
you know what kind of like a 32 brought
so so we're not exactly a fun of finding
9 sides up there's nothing quite like a
few of in your soup on death penalty and
that is engineering a lot of the way
it's experience of my life I just at
that pizza knees and Peaks that came out
my nose

beach because I even love being near the
ocean or somewhere else just not happy
with where I'm at in my apartment it's
like it's a great apartment it does
everything it needs to do it serves the
purpose but you know it's close to
everything but I think I just prefer to
be near this every day and open my door
and being in the big middle of a city
yeah that's what we should be doing
right now
a few brewskies on a helicopter that'll
be quick I feel like this is the best
huh in searches we found Nicki again

it's minor work yeah you laughter knows
with all the mistakes we're making and
you're the mom so you have to clear it
up rekt yeah yeah yeah things escalate
and then then that I got it oh all right
that's a little girl okay guys we got
your create your uh Ricky time and I
like if I walk on the street to please
my recipe to do drugs to take that a few
minutes ago I had lied would be my hair
I think that's right now guess I'm going
to a son C club for dinner I'm actually
meeting up with a you know syndicate
original so the wristbands we sell the
company that makes noise out of called
the other day as people came up to me
like told I was like rhino you guys and
they're like no but we make your
response if you're closing but no
fucking way and they were like let's go
out for dinner so we're going out the
dinner I probably logged much there's
gonna be like business you talk but
nonetheless a nice elevator oh my gosh
that's absolutely wicked it projects the
image down on the ground
open to the door public oh dude okay
yeah - home time that ended up being a
really really awesome night great food
awesome to meet drew from electric
family but where was one problem the
place that we went to is called Soho
House is something that's heard of it's
like a private membership club that's
like 400 500 pounds some of my year but
you get to go to all their exclusives
for bars around the world like Tokyo
Miami
Hollywood London that sort of stuff and
you know I went in and as I was on the
floor as like what about Simon I was
like I'm not really supposed to be on
your phone or meeting in stairs and I
was kind of waiting like you know
whatever it's kind of it confused by why
said and then
as we went to these like a buffet really
nice buffet which you saw a tiny clip of
and as I was at the book day I went to
film the book they and the guy was like
we might want to be quick with that
you're not supposed to be on your phone
I was like you're not going to scoop
what's going on so I was like we not
supposed to um phoned it was like no
it's like a private member club with
like really famous people in these clubs
and stuff like that so they don't want
people on their phones and I was like
hmm so unfortunately that is why make
sure I don't leave my keys in the door
that is why you didn't see me film which
was there it was a business talk anyway
the entire time so it was like really
cool
Drew's an awesome guy we've work with
and I think like meals nearly three
years with Cindy coverage you know you
know the wrist buns we do they're the
company that actually produced the
response so really really cool to see an
awesome guy like really really top guy
so that was great but now I need to get
my washing out of the washing machine
and put it in the dryer so he's aren't
going to be soggy and wet and about to
be drying crispy no how is this edits
