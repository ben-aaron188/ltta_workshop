the guard but like part of me wants to
say like are they actors not in an
insulting way because see anyone really
messing with them here at the same time

umbrella
anyway Ravens have often been team has
bad omens and symbols of death told you
and this is the story but they flee the
Ravens ever leave the white color the
white color would crumble and the
kingdom was fall so that's why they kept
to keep them here I'm well aware it's
just a bridge but having a
beautiful-looking bridge I'm just going
to go and get quick those with it so
they wear it in the daytime and overflow
the cloud but then as soon as they come

be pretty sick if I can get a video ever
coming out like a clue and I'd be like
septum I like your channel I subscribed
this is going to seem super random but
this if you ever come to London it's
just near Big Ben it's like a sign in
front of like all the houses of us this
sign is where my dad brought me when I
was a little kid and he came down with
me and my sister when I was about 8
years old my sis was about 10 and I
stood at that sign and I wasn't even
taller than this size if I go close to
it I'm not even that much bigger than it
now but I came up about here on the side
and if you go to my dad's house please
don't go to my dad's house offices but
when I go to that house I'll make a
video and show you guys where about them
understand so every time I've ever come
down I always take a photo of this and
it shows how I've changed over the years
so yeah cool little fun we think dad if
you're watching this I got a fall over
the side I hope she left me in for a cup
of tea because my hands are bloody
freezing and I'm not too sure on or not
