like the oddest circumstance but I need
to explain that that was not my poo
because I would not have put the clip of
a piece of food on my food in the video

scenario but how random was that I was
like sorry you food I'm like oh god

can like talk as loud as I want which is
that Bosch thing never out of mind so
you guys usually see me like eat food on
a plane and still book because this is a
light fly I don't think I get any so

have myself a nice glass of champagne
not much sure I think it's like a tuna
thing on the bottom but maybe some
guacamole and egg berry a piano
