checkpoint boom
I knew there would be security because
II just don't make sense to like the dam

like blow up a summit in a lot what
would happen if the dam actually
exploded with it it would have filled
flood Vegas surely Oh No Alice's kisses

how much attention this car gets like we
just just leave it alone and people go
up taking photos of like pretending to
get in it and stuff like really cool yo
