people if you're watching this blog

for what happened with today's vlog I
posted it it was a seven minute fifty
video but you should I grow I try to
vlog I loaded the video it was seven
minutes fifty long unfortunately YouTube
uploaded it and it corrupted it broke
and I tended to like a four-minute fifty
video for some reason so everyone was
like fuck you you didn't even show what
you were doing in the video of a bla I
just want to say I'm sorry I would never
do that to you guys
you broke so I apologize honestly I've
now got what loaded through my ones

going to take me like three hours so I
apologize you got this so late tonight

up with my new curtains this morning I
know it sounds so boring and so stupid

goddamn different planet because when I
had these closed it was so dark I
genuinely thought like I'd slept a full
day good morning Steve what do you do it

there but instead he chills on his own
windy day tingling now I am totally not
supposed to be here right now I'm
supposed to be a meal with my grandma my
not mind my dad's mom and all the family
but because this idiot decided to stay
playing video games on that last night I
only just woke up and I'm an hour late

green kitchen home garden and it smells
like cow poo

and all of a sudden my dad I was like
what are you doing here and he was like
I forgot to make you bet and if you guys
don't know my dad like kind of works I
mean I know it sounds so dumb that I
don't make my own bed but that is
literally one of the things that my dad
does maybe semi-retired I basically just
give him like a random job like you know
keeping the family employed and he came
and he made me better so I'm gonna get
off the floor from this quote I can come
and get in that so many people seem so
confused by that fact but it's just like
my dad semi-retired least 62 years old
and doesn't want to be like building
something so like I might kind of employ
him as a house maintenance man so yeah I
get to see him I get to see him all the
time I keep him close and he gets paid
for a job so it's perfect and now I have
my bed back my room is nice and cozy
well maybe two hours completely forgot
that like a week without the scratchcard
so I'm gonna get it done now it needs to
be done so let's see if we're gonna win
four million British pounds so do I
think we're going to win it he'll them

heavy breathing in the background I'm
watching Star Wars because after I watch
