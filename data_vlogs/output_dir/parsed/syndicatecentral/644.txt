card and say hello to around Christmas
time they're not in they're not in like
like a feel abundant I've come to visit
every single family member

hit the pad I feel like everyone's gone
I'm alone I'm gonna learn some ranger
all by myself well I'm going on plane
God absolutely everyone is busy out
Christmas shopping all my mates don't
want to go out and do anything I want to
go see the new Star Wars so I'm gonna
see if his tickets available because
there is I'm going to the cinemas on my
fucking hogs I'm so excited to the Star
Wars and no one wants to go and watch it
so I'm gonna try and see on my own if I
don't fucking
I think this vlog should be called the
loneliest of all I'll get ever because
I'm going to the cinemas on my own and I
just went and got takeout Nando's I got
a chicken burger I'm going sitting in my
car eating it and then go ahead and
watching the film in about two minutes
so yep really depressing today May rogue
one was sick whoa the UK is so foggy
today like London's worse than this but
holy shit look at it mother of God look
how foggy it is you ready full beams
what the like laser beams oh shit my
entire road is so foggy right now look
at that just looks like aliens of London
the house is looking nice and cool and
that's a job placement God so where I'm
going cook myself some food let's see
how this give us all my cousin's text me
like come out come out come out and then
I got my brother texting me to go out
with him as well so I think the point is
be smart
food I've gotta wait 40 minutes for that
eat my food go see my brother for a bit
down at the pub and then potentially go
down to Manchester didn't I say this
week was a week of no partying and
drinking it's the it's the build-up to
Christmas it was inevitable inevitable
egoic a now this countless of wool
that's all this looks a little bit burn
it should go nice and tasty when it's
out of the pot nom nom nom nom it's
pretty good to be honest yeah I'm a fun
man as the day's progressed more and
more I'm getting more and more tired
make sense but like what the hell I'm
just so exhausted I generally think I'm
sick to be honest just cuz like my arms
feel like my body feels weak that sort
of support Oh No maybe I just need to
man up and just deal with it but they
just realize didn't give you guys a
review of rogue one now in summary
awesome film I think it's set between
like the third and fourth film with some
more long lines but it's like set in
between not like after all a brand new
one or something it's a Star Wars story
or movie like whatever but it's a good
film I give it a solid 8 out of 10 I
really recommend you go watching it it
would be disappointing for yourself if
you haven't watched every other Star
Wars film because you'll see what the
Easter eggs are out and you're like ah
that's really good but 8 out of 10 it
drags out a little bit some of the plot
seems you like really how did that
person not die or how did that
stormtrooper not just kill them then
like lots of that but it's so worth it
for the end the end act is incredible
the scenes are so fucking good and the
Easter egg of how it all ties together
is perfect it's absolutely perfect
really really recommend you go and watch
new so eight out of ten
rogue one score from sindhikka but I am
dying I thought I was getting ill and
this is now the next day I'm definitely
gettin oh I think I've got like flu or
something like that hopefully it passes
before Christmas but I'm drinking why I
like crazy I'm taking tablets like crazy
I just felt like really down yesterday
now is that or maybe just a hangover
from drinking that before but no I'm
pretty much getting sick which kind of
sucks over I might up deal with it and
everything will be good to go but I've
woke up today like 3 o'clock good
afternoon it's now 5 o'clock and so
