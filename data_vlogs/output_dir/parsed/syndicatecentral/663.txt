oh no no not this again I could just see
something on my CCTV going back and
forth back and forth I was like what the
hell is it
and it's the crow the calm peaceful way
to start my day with a nice cup of tea
at a dead crow it's memories I didn't
kill the crow but I did wake up this
morning to him bashing on me windows
again I was like there's no way that
noise is in fact the crows again on my
CCTV I heard it saw it and was like so
I've got trying ok where they live now
because I'm gonna go to their house and
I'm gonna smash on their goddamn nest
with that goddamn shotgun today we start
the day being rather damn tired I got
woken up by Stephen scratching it is a
very and like it's even my granddaddy
wakes me up you see what the crows that
wake me up and then all of a sudden it's
my goddamn bearded dragon scratching
away is vivere I'm trying to get out and
come play with me so I'm starting today
rather tired but about an hour or so I'm
going to London I demand to get a taxi
so I got the next best thing
thanks dad the best thing yeah I'm sorry
about that outside it's rich from our
way let's see if I can actually now go
there you go Hey yeah you owe me use
pair of sunglasses by the way I'm gonna
tell them what the story is class baby
let's rock'n'roll whereabouts am I see
this is what I'm talking about
pretzels or even a sandwich with egg and
hominy and crisps a beer and a cup of
tea and not forgetting the most
important thing wouldn't banana I fell
asleep on the train but nonetheless made
it down to London time to head to my
destination and I think I might just
make it in time to give in this place is
so dumb busy like a mad rush
taxi to my destination there's supposed
to be a cow waiting for where I'm going
but I didn't get the details for it so I
don't know where it is then they were
like I'll distribute a taxi but I can
get a train there and I'd rather get a
trainers like a bit of an adventure so
that's what I'm doing
it is insane how busy is in London right
now I made it to London but it looks
like even like America that's like a
proper American building I can see that
red light there is the London honey
we've got like a five minute walk to get
to where I'm going pretty sure the thing
give you starts at 6:00 or half a sicked

building that I'm going to so I'm gonna
risk this one we've all got the scrim
name outside I'm gonna risk this wanna
see how it goes no idea he was gonna be

future of entertainment it's the future
of our fucking labs we're gonna become
like them we'll be people who sit in the
chairs get far from eating through a
tube and just be in VR cuz like it's so
good it's so damn good and I just need
to work out a way of how to be able to
capture it
it's about show me my gameplay and me at
the same time because I have so much fun
in VR like that then everyone was like
