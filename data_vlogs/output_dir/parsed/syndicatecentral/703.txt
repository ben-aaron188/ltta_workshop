it a smooth ride round out and just see
how things go and I didn't realize how

whole forty minutes because I try to

Wi-Fi because they had well faster than
their if you can't tell I'm at the
bloody airport

quickest I've ever got through London
Heathrow security doesn't change the
fact that I am still like but I can't
tell whether I'm tired from lack of
sleep on my body's that wrecked from the
amount of g-force that experienced today
I'm gonna guess it's like g-force cuz I
feel like I got off a roller coaster
know
because that is how this ride day felt
incredible so much fun but mind that
g-force that was the easiest I just
bought an iPhone I literally just walked
on if you go any of these in stock
iPhone 7 plus anyway yeah we got the jet
black which is the one I won in two five
six gigabytes side that that easy I'm
finally getting one well that might be
the most depressing thing ever
the guy thought I said iPhone 7 it's not
so important so they don't have one in
stock therefore I don't get to get one
yet nothing I'm so devastated right now
like I was like that would be the
perfect end to a day if I could have
picked up a seven-course but
unfortunately no bueno
I've got one more shot that I can try
downstairs to see if they have any stock
is that see if they have any stock
downstairs I doubt he'll grill at all
