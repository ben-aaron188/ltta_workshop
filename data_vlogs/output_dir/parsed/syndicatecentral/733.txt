something to pimp out his office so I
put his beaver
back on his desk just looking mysterious
as fuck I'm getting excited now because
I've got a desk just like this in the UK
way for me to build it and it moves so
delicately look at how does it go how
does it what oh holy shit

to it for comparison that's a you look
fabulous man fat Oh work it work it work
it yeah
this is just typical la isn't just
traffic traffic and more traffic yeah we
definitely look like we're about to like
it's like the hole in the earth just
ahead and all the monsters are climbing
out of it that's well spooky that is so
pink it doesn't even look real
next stop next destination is watching
the premiere of salmon Nico's a corridor
digital film rush we made it here on
time
got Luke the homie over here and check
this out rush inspired by battlefield
but yeah yeah I fucked up and completely
didn't eat any of my popcorn I'm gonna
keep this as a gift for myself I'm
probably send it to keep stir because
it's a bit bigger than his made out of
rush I'm so proud of Simon Nick oh
absolutely killed it I'm very very
impressed we're now going getting some
pizza and I'm gonna keep this as a
momentum Fred in Hilary edgy music we
have located where they're gonna put the
food so we're standing here and waiting
until this table gets full of PSM
and I am not drinking alcohol I drink
not be four days in a row
nope I'm doing voice acting tomorrow
could it be professional Jimmy and an
iPhone 7 and didn't tell me okay
and this this is it the quality doesn't
even look that much better so I do daily
vlogging on an iPhone so vlogging on an
iPhone is really important and I thought
this camera was going to change
everything I don't think it's going to
fuck okay so this is an iPhone 7 that
vlogging on right now however the
quality should be so much better it
should be impressive it's the 7 not the
7 plus and that one's got a Batman
camera but the front camera is the same
as the force from the normal one so if
this looks good leave a like great if it
doesn't then I am really not excited to
get my iPhone 7 I'm now video back to my
old cameo there's me back on the potato
sixth arm and you think it made a
difference let me know I don't think it
does Swift advice better enlighten my
low lighting over here book oh it's
waterproof I guess no headphone jack
another no goddamn headphone joaquina
this is some bullshit oh whoa
this week the piano black that loves its
fingerprint only look at the pilot
coming up that easy no show i watch one
channel pretty small dude today I got to
wear his art the measure is correct

enclosed
