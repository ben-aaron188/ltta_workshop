before the started today's vlog I need
to let you all know that we will be
doing this road trip and traveling all
around the UK we're going to be going
counterclockwise I'm gonna be going to
Scotland we're going to go into Ireland
we go into Wales we're going down to
London Jonah goes like everywhere in the
UK we'll be trying to visit we won't be
able to go to every city possible we'll
be stopping up as many locations as we
can on the way now I'm going to tweeting
from my Twitter pretty much the pure
only essentials of the trip so I'll be
tweeting most likely the day before we
turn up somewhere and on the day of what
time we're going to arrive because it's
difficult for us to estimate with
traffic with time with everything
where and when we're going to be in
certain location so if you guys I want
it to meet up in the UK on this tour and
get a horse and raise the swag some
syndicate swag and just to meet me in
general take a photo and say hi hi-5
then we get back on our journey then
make sure you follow me on Twitter in
the description all right it's going to
be crazy it's going to be chaotic but
we're trying our best to some more
organizers last-minute so I hope to see
as many of your guys faces as possible
then yeah bastards
attacking my fucking house so no down in
Paradise I want to be subtle there on my
furniture but I currently took off all
the cushions yesterday because it
absolutely chopped it down because I
made a mistake of not getting what
approved cushions so are they nice and
dry yet Wow
oh my gosh yeah yes and they're almost
dry which is great but at the same time
doesn't matter because alice is looking
after Steve Steve has run out of food
and his ball for his Bavarian let's keep
any more MS he is currently broken so we
need to go and pick up a new one of them
for Steve I wonder what damage these
little shits have done this time this
looks kind of fresh little fuckers look
at them what they do this is the seal
that like keeps the window in place and
sort of water doesn't get behind it and
they're eat in the rubber look eating it
eating it eating it eating it what the
fuck are they doing it actually looks
like a really really nice day but then
when you look over here this
greatest of clouds coming over the house
so we're gonna be quick with what we're
doing outside today and then maybe we
can relax in the Sun and get a bit of a
tag
absolutely love swinging by Haslem icons
because this is the one that I used to
work at so like half the stuff that are
still there I still know so I just get
to catch up with them and then I don't
get any free food write it in so ok
