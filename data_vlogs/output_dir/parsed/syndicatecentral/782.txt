now that's what I like to see a nice
clean kitchen that I clean myself some
pretty tempo right now I am feeling so
much better today I had so much sleep
like nine ten hours almost I haven't
eaten any future and it's currently
nearly one o'clock in the afternoon
already but cleaned all the kit job
everything is happy there good vibes
good good energy feeling like I'm ready
to start the day but I need to get that
new camera that I got yet yesterday
working but before I do that let me show
you guys this I went with my granddad
yesterday to a MacOS field on that
little fair and when I was a little fair
a little shopping thing whatever it was
I saw this now I didn't know it came
with a case but I'll give it up it's
broken book now I like collecting like
cool or random things and you might be
like why the hell did you get scammer it
doesn't look like anything special now
first of all that I was like hey that's
pretty cool you know you can actually if
you unlock the top of this you take it
off and you could put film in it I was
going to get well excited if it was
actually like an old school like war
film in there sort of thing that I can
go and get developed but no but this is
actually the camera oh look at that
how amazing is that this is gonna be my
brand-new vlogging camera this thing's
amazing but the cool thing about this as
well as they like it trapped like
attracts a truck what it's camera
actually I don't know if it could be
used or anything for the woman showed me
that if you take out this little pin out
the back this is what they used to do to
write and sign on the actual photos so
you foot down as panel and the film
would be behind it and you'd press
against the film here by writing into it
like the day or the place of where it
was and then it would appear on the
photo or along the bottom of the funnel
like there's no ink in it or anything
it's just like you'd inscribe it into it
so yeah I picked up this for like 20
British pounds I'm like a little sale
thought it was dead cool let's go like I
don't know this is for light and
exposure and stuff like that I'm pretty
sure that's not like a modern-day flash
or anything but yeah picked up this
little piece of care I thought you said
cool I thought I'd show you guys so yeah
gonna be starting daily vlogging with
this bad boy I'll cool it that'd be ok
office you're way too filthy for my
liking so I'm going to try by the end of
the day and get this all completely
clean organized in shelves in boxes in
whatever do something with all this
because this is just way too much been
way too much chaos but if we go over
here real quick this is the new camera
really I'm not joking for the past 20
minutes I've been holding this camera
like looking where to find it and I just
realize this shit ah how does it fail so
I can now get on my day and setting up
this help soon as though I was gonna
like make this whole video about like

thing and you guys are gonna help me I
know I'd find it by them but oh well the
quality on this camera is so damn good

might do and if i zoom in and I paint
this wall green you might actually not
even notice this all about me so if i
zoom into it

but like I'm pretty sure I did but I
plucked in the new screen this is like
the South now and I think it looks
pretty damn sweet I'm installing all the
updates taking even longer but I still
want to switch them around that or I get
another one of those screens there here
and then switch them back and forth but
I don't know what it's like playing on a
console with that sort of resolution
screen so we shall see but then as
always I might fall asleep watching
Pokemon in bed and now I've only just
woke up and it's 10 o'clock
