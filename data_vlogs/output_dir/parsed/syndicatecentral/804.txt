place where the shops - yeah the walking
area perfect I'm gonna have hopefully a
massive rank I wanna be I wanna be
ranked 10 by the end of tomorrow it's a
big statement but if you could do that

24 hours oh my god this is like one of
my favorite pokemons holy shit

difficult catch no lo there's no way yes
it is it gonna be duplicate yeah I think

about out
there's no way you're getting on it oh
you call this come on Connor Oh bah he
disappears sometimes yeah fuck oh dude I
got so happy for you oh my gosh dad if
you're watching this vlog you will know
this song for our I beat the chill out
kick backs on the beach
oh the bastards the chip oh my god dad
that was almost about to be our jam but
they ruined it I'm sorry bro
okay me and liquor over there near a
fine cuz someone dropped a pokemon law
and now over here someone dropped three
and all these people no joke everyone
stood there is playing Pokemon fucking
go
this is absolutely credible just can
wrap my head around mothers that many
people sound like Connor I was gonna
like head over towards it cuz there's a
store there there's a store there and
just one across so in the three places
the stores people have dropped laws on
every place it basically attracts
Pokemon and because people poker we've
been attracted to all the places that's
all the people sat there playing fucking
Pokemon go this is incredible I love my
entire years of playing video games I
don't think I've ever seen a game bring
so many random people together out in
the streets Pokemon go has a thousand
percent done its job in getting people
to walk out be about and stuff like that
to the point where it's like I can see
people like hiring other people to go on
walks catch pokemon from and level them
up wine really really hoping that when
I'm back in the UK I can like get him a
car drive around and catch a shitload a
boat mud and then like take over all the
gyms in the area and just make it my
mission and vlog it to be like the
number one gym trainer or gym master
whatever you want to call it pokemon
trainer ever I was an amazing afternoon
out like I would kind of wait to say I
was walking around but like my phone but
she's like dying Luke used up all like
weirdly enough this isn't that heavy it
looks huge and heavy but it's not like
probably probably the same way it's an
iPhone book we've used up all the
battery in that unfortunately because it
wasn't fully charged so I couldn't stay
out there walking around catching
pokémon force the app was just like
bugging out all day so I'm not too sure
I really want to go out and just buy
like another like phone contract sort of
thing so as but as a u.s. one because
I've currently just got a UK one so that
way I can download the US version of the
Pokemon game because apparently that
one's more stable nonetheless it's been
fun catching some Pokemon on the Blinn
up I know exactly what I'm doing now and
like how to use laws and everything so
when I get back out get like a tomorrow
with Luke all day I hopefully end to
come back at the end of the day with
like 100 Pokemon so we'll see if I go
from being level 3 to like level 10
that's like my aim but nonetheless great
day out great day of being a protecto
and over than that let's continue making
video videos it's only 6 o'clock at
night right now and I feel like it
should be midnight
I'm not tired if I've got a monster
energy which oh my gosh I do I'm gonna
be kicking back the entire day basically
playing doom I've been seen everyone
playing it specifically leafy I've been
watching leave his videos and he's been
playing the shoutout zoom in like the
gameplay section that you like it where
he's talking I'm just like I really want
to fucking play this game so I'm
downloading it didn't realize it was 50
goddamn gigabytes so downloaded man I'm
gonna play through that it says it takes
about like 12 13 hours to complete so I
could try and see if I can crack it out
in a one straight stint or a
day-and-a-half sort of thing so we'll
see how that gets on and I will give my
little review of what I think of doom in
the next day makes sense right oh my
goodness let's do this I'm so stoked for
this game it looks absolutely beautiful
like this is probably one of the best
looking games or shooters I've ever seen
more like it's starting to go nighttime
outside I think I'm missing UFC 200
right now so I'm really really good at
but the thing is in my apartment in LA
and I don't have like cables so I can't
go online and order it I'm using a UK
British card and I can't like go online
and use exsist like you have to be a US
bank card holder to be able to purchase
this sort of thing so it's really
frustrating that I can't watch UFC 200
right now but nonetheless play Doom
really do like it but I just don't know
if I want to commit to like sort of the
same thing for 13 hours straight you
could say playing call duty or playing
so that I always like the same thing if
you play
for 13 hours straight either way but I
don't know just on how I feel about
right now it's good fun but I think I'm
gonna have to take a break from it for
now and play a little bit of call of
duty zombies the best few hours I've
been playing some slithered Rio some
doom I did like I said give up on dooms
you just let the same thing for period
of time but a recorded similar so like
I've got a good video coming out of that
it's real good fun with that so I really
really really appreciate this port when
everyone watching the gaming videos on
the main channel I'd like to get enough
time when I'm not traveling to record
enough videos for a month's worth of
videos like day after day after day
after day but again like I'm always
traveling like crazy so as soon as I get
back to the UK and I get settled I'll be
working on sorting out on fixing my UK
setup and once that's all done and
dusted like I'm going to empty the room
and rebuild it from scratch to make it
perfection like with soundproofing and
make sure the AC works in there like
perfectly just to be rocking and rolling
and that should be everything so
tomorrow is Pokemon deck Pokemon dote a
what tomorrow is Pokemon go day I'm
actually trying to install rust because
mr. mood is playing on like a roll place
of a flight 24 hours and I like rust I
just haven't played it in a long time so
I'm tempted to try and jump on there
with them and see if I can cause some
mischief so we'll see what we can do so
thank you very much for watching this
video guys if you've enjoyed the vlog
mix you leave like right like I said
lots more Pokemon go come in
I'll use my other phone to film this
phone tomorrow and so I can basically
like get the entire like Pokemon go
experience recorded so that should be
pretty cool so much luck to your faces
I'll catch you guys later
and he else
