know
isn't something good ask food ok look at
that pastry enjoy Danish Oh what oh my
gosh why did we not have dinner up here
fortunately these two haven't got time
to do the bobsleigh so we're actually
gonna do instead we're gonna go take a
selfie on the front and I'm gonna have
to head off on our journey and try and
get the camper van back in time so come
on Jay we're taking our goodbye fault
all together all these adorable little
toys and stuff for kids and then you
come over here and you've got genuine
sheepskin nipple warmers genuine possum
for Lily warmer and what the heck much
more okay then look how much fun they're
having you could have been doing that
but no
I mean pretty sure this girl pretty sure
this would only seat a book I don't see
any stuff saying no so there's no
stacking Yolo also must have shout out
to Nick who was just been there just
bumped into us and said oh well that
backpack in New Zealand was doing summer
summer school and stuff
advanced advanced science to my hat but
hello to your face sorry I didn't put
you in a vlog would have been made more
sense to have done that but if you watch
this hello
alrighty then it's the race against time
our flight is at 1 o'clock and it's
currently 1156 got all our bikes to
check which means we're probably not
going to make the flight but we can
always try reason I say that is because
we've got to get from where we are now
to the Queen's Queenstown Airport we
have to return the RV but because Jeff
isn't flying home with us
we're gonna give him the RV to return
that instead and we're gonna try and
jump on this flight to get us back to
basically Auckland where we got a like a
stopover at like Wellington or some type
are gonna get to Oakland and then we
gotta fly out from Auckland back to LA
at like 9 o'clock at night something so
we'll just have to wait and see how that
sort of thing goes ok just in case you
don't see you again it's been a pleasure
my friend absolute love you I'm gonna
check I'm gonna run back to you if we
can't make it alright persecute us we're
back good fine high five love you Jay

my friend you me Wizards at getting
places on time how we've managed it so
far that how we've existed this trip I
don't know all we can say right now is
Jeff
thank you vlogging away and all of a
sudden just like big group of dudes here
to my side light you want to say hello
it's like cool last tip it's going in
but I definitely want to be in it there
you go
but very nice to meet you all we
actually made it onto this damn plane
Angelo we're we're true wizards right
now true goddamn wizards this is a
business seat and in this I would shoot
him as evil world traveler a premium
economy mum is one of the nicest
primitive communism ever cinema water
tank recline mode activated what glass I
got customers
to ourselves for the sky can't freaking
Drive the Stars we've got some prawns
some garlic bread and drink on the way
and watch it a bit of the flash that's
the guy from prison big and Angelo's
awake
ie my my companionship of the night is
going to bed are you going to sleep well
not in a camper but this is the best
nights that you've ever had in your life
in the past two weeks like oh my god a
bed that's got wet doesn't stink of Jays
boots you got Hey
you don't hit me in Jay fighting on each
other in the night okay
Slee mother and just like Angelo's and
my bed is now made second on well good
morning that was a really easy flight
I've got about 43 minutes left before we
want at dinner watched three episodes of
the flash and then passed out for 8
hours so I am ready to land in Los
Angeles and start day
meanwhile Angelo is still sleeping
Morgan is like a little bear but anyway
yeah
40 minutes remaining and I'm just gonna
kick back and chill it out I did
actually miss breakfast so a bit good
because they had bacon an egg that sucks
but either way I think I don't announce
took at the terminal at LAX looking
secure it's gonna take me about two
hours to get through it I want someone
just tweeted to me saying is that the
vlog has got 30 minutes to be up and if
it doesn't get up by 30 minutes then my
daily vlogging thing I'm now officially
one day kind of late which sucks but
there's nothing I could do about the
time difference so I apologize but
there's nothing I can do about being
stuck in this queue so much look to your
faces if you leave a like rating and a
sad comment saying rip it rip Tom's
daily vlogs I'll catch you guys tomorrow
for the next vlog well I'm absolutely
devastated it took me two and a half
hours to get through Air Force Korea LAX
if I would have managed to get it
actually done quicker I would've got the
vlog or it would have been on time would
have been great but unfortunately now
that means I've done nine months I said
give or take when situations like this
happen
going through airport security or
traveling my time zones messing up well
pretty much it a vlog of every single
day before midnight in the UK and
unfortunately today is the one day that
I didn't go up on time so all I can do
is apologize sorry let myself down I
tried everything my power like internet
on my phone and then at the airport
internet on my phone here in anime
airport the airport Hicks it didn't work
and just nothing work whatsoever so
 devastating honestly really
upset about that so now going to get the
bag get the bag and then in today's walk
finally got my bag yay
on that note of receiving it's in Assam
in the next day I have to stop this
 stop vlogging the next day so
guys thank you very much for watching
I'm sorry for letting you guys down I
literally tried my best you can ask
Angelo as I try not building the
calendar to the airport try loading at
the airport tried uploading here when we
landed on my phone data that didn't work

 happens but anyway love you guys
