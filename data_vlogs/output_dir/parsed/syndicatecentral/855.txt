later
these two guys are updating the drone
that is drying I have a van accent good
news for location one is I've got 3G and
I can actually upload videos to YouTube
I just use the cap trap to try it
kicking back with a beer and relaxing
and I uploaded a 10-second clip and it
took 45 seconds to upload it today's
vlog so far is like 15 minutes so it's
gonna take a long time but I can leave
it on overnight and get that vlog up and
I totally remembered that the vlogs and
not supposed to be up at 6 a.m. they're
supposed to be up at 5 a.m. so every day
this week or the past few days since
I've been in New Zealand not only have
they been likes I've been waking up late
and uploading them wait they've been
late because I totally was choosing a
long time to upload them it's alright
well I made these guys try McVitie's
chocolate digestive biscuits how do you
find it oh yeah and you think it was a
goal a Girl Scout cookie yeah you're
being disrespectful for my country right
now alright it either way I'm deciding
to make these the super me instant
noodles so it comes with a whip I feel
like I'm making like a one of them weird
YouTube like videos of like weird foods
and shit or we try and make business to
how it turns out but either way got the
gas on the go
Jeff's Oh better skin off Jeff up there
and yeah we should be good for that and
we found out this place has Wi-Fi so
we're checking out speeds right now hey
this really is one of those Japanese
like you
yourself I can make a burger shit like
that's putting in apparently and chicken
flavor how all got to do is wait for the
fusion wait 30 seconds
put it in and then add the sauce pretty
sure this is supposed to be an egg well
one story Shaw a stop in this packet
tastes great this everything in that is
disgusting I tried each bit of it
individually and it was just disgusting
I'm not even gonna bother mixing it but
I tried them as noodles on their own
yeah you tried them yet
alright we're gonna see what Jeff thinks
and he tries them Jess reaction and I do
not just cook you so good I need to know
what it's like well you have the best
noodles on earth every dude a 1i mother

beer all over the goddamn bed so after
betting now he's drying off and for this
little here whilst I'm making my food

noodles last Angelo gets the second
serving obviously I've got a look after
the photographer first cuz he's working
