we all have kept reasons a little
children hmm
very nice another day another outfit
today I'm a penguin
that's just our wife it's just like how
life works really either way pretty damn
tight even though I got a lot of sleep
but just the way life plans oh really
yeah oh no my foot just to spin either
way I'm giggling and happy because one
complete shit and - oh it's 1 o'clock in
the afternoon and I've got the vlog
uploaded ready to go for today so I
don't have to worry about the rest of
the day I'd have to be running up and
down mountains for Wi-Fi or 4G another
than that I'm good so yeah well I'm a
very happy man when I get the vlog doing
that now I'm starting to feel hung over
by the way last night kind of got a
little bit rough Ricky thought it was a
good idea to drink all the Jagermeister
so never again I always say that and
then do it the next day on that deal of
easy steam P stops clock - oh nine point
nine into second

guy's jacket says legal observer and
there's a fire burn hole in the back of
it pressing you all night
hey are you shaking good man unlucky
ginge

I am genuinely surprised the amount of
Scottish people who have turned up here
just to say hello to me they have no
idea what this mountain by traces about
anything about it but they're coming
along saying hello

hours hours just to come in to say hello
