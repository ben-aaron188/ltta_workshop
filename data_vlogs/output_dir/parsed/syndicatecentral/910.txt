oh no no I've just woke up and my
blondes dad didn't have to happen like
this I was trying to save you I was
giving you water every single day now
you just like a dry pickle fuck about
father well goodbye apartment I will see
you in three weeks time when I return
and until then you're just going to stay
ridiculously messy like the Camco before
there's tiles on the floor and we're bad
is there some what me but it has been a
pleasure I love you when I back I think
we might be having a new PC in the setup
was it so let's say goodbye to that as
well
goodbye self look at yourself okay
through security I think I'm gonna go
and get some food at the airport lounge
usually it's some trick downcast food so
let's go check it out god damn it's
busier than last time
last time I was here was completely
empty alright alright alright what's on
the menu
we got mac and cheese we got something
we got I think we've run out Kerry
either way it is beautiful selection
food you got all that you got all your
fruits well Mick fucking gigantic
carrots and an apple with a stick net no
one's down here was Tony I was done it
drinks fruit chocolate fuck yes now
because I file a British hours all the
time I'm in silver Club member so that
means I get to come in here just enjoy
the food and Oliver is free effectively
you pay for it by like get all the
flights or the same airline but if you
do all the same price the airline get
chocolate brownies four-course meals for
free so hmm
I can't complain I want to know the
rules for like how long you can actually
stay in here talk was like say you've
got like a 12 hour delay between the
fire yeah sure you can do that but like
let's say if you gave in here and
purposely missed every single fly it was
like almost beds out there you can sleep
on this showers in here you can use and
there's food every day for free here
they can eat you could be homeless at an
airport too sure how I managed this one
bought I think I booked the wrong flight
now don't worry I'm still going to
England which is great but I usually
only ever try and fly with British
Airways and I just heard the
announcement for my flight but saying
it's with American Airlines which is a
don't know line for flying this amount
of distance so I'm even gonna be really
happy when I get on the plane I'm gonna
be severely disappointed let's wait and
see oh my gosh this guy's got all the
swag
wait but in fact this guy's got all swag
now Heights definitely this guy that is
what you call improve security right
there putting people on segways I saw
people riding past on my bicycles I'd be
well pissed off if I got put on a
bicycle I'd be like bitch where's my
Segway ladies and gentlemans finally
he'd remember that secret project that I
was out filming I could tell you
anything about nets completely skip it
the day I went to the gun range well I
was hanging around with NVIDIA and
lootcrate all day to photos it
absolutely amazing the clip is gonna
play now
so that's just a teaser of what went
down if you guys want to see the full
video there be a link down description
to be able to go check out I went
skydiving with two Red Bull athletes and
teams who won the lootcrate mega crate
like worth thousands of dollars and it's
got a bunch of in video swag in it loot
crate swag in it and I just wanna say a
massive thank you to them to companies
for sponsoring this video to making that
happen and basically just sponsoring the
awesome opportunity of me being able to
throw myself out of a plane and if in
your comment you decide to leave your
Twitter handle I may be picking some
people to give away some loot crate's to
so if you wanna win one of them and get
comment in get over to the video and
I'll find you guys there
personally I hardly ever read books and
I'm making a decision to buy this book
it says smarter faster better
potentially try and read it all on the
plane and also which I'll look at that
well I just missed that one they just
call my name out so that's gonna be
interesting to find out if I've got a
flight but I have a book a magazine and
a lot of snacks and watch the rather
excited to read a book I'm if there's
any films on the plane I've definitely
watch the book I really wanted to keep
myself more like this year I've learned
to snowboard
I'm learning to skydive I'm gonna learn
to fly a helicopter bought on business
aspect of things I really really really
want to just like broaden my horizons
with things things are going well but I
want to do it like tenfold like smart or
even smart or investments and all that
sort so yeah I might teach you guys a
few of the things that I've got up to so
far that I paid up really well for me
like really well but we'll see we'll see
I was like strolling going shopping
going for the toilet and stuff like that
then everyone's already boarding I'm the
last person to get on the plane luckily
obviously I have a reserved seat so it's
not like it's going anywhere
I'm not last fucking person to get on
the plane oh shit there's my pocket
literally I said they would call out my
name born
know what for but anyway think a walk
down few more steps I might have made it
yeah I'm fine the British Airways plane
and I'm flying on me oh my gosh this is
the this is the same plane that flies me
from London to here so it's good to be
back on it's a good point
did I say that that means it's got all
the swag like HDTVs USB cable ports and
all that unless they've named another
plane leaf and it fucking sucks and I
just like started retracting it and they
didn't know I was on it I'm just like oh
let's not let's not jinx it I'm playing
luckily no that's what I'm I'm not
holding his back for either way 12-hour
flight let's go
12-hour flight stickers boarding as
complete as quite times five hours 50
minutes I was upset for five years for
next time away till next time
the record I went back watching Creed
the day perfect for our food I am dogs
wait let me get it oh my gosh relative
steak yes
this was so good last time yeah
lastly this RIT yeah it was actually
really really good well the lovely
weather in England amazing she has a
selfie stick I am hoping that this
security check line does not take too
long to get through if you're wondering
why it's cuz I need to prove I told just
said that near that scary guy and he was
like I was like yeah okay so London was
completely change their security system
now there's two new escalators that I've
been installed because when you usually
go up here it takes you about an hour to
get through I always complain about it
but now apparently they've installed new
ones for normal people and then this one
for like business class and fast pass so
I hope he gets quick the anticipation is
killing me also nice shoes okay that was
fast
it took me not even five minutes to get
through security I cannot complain
London Heathrow I now love your airport
system thank you unfortunately this time
around the airport lounge for British
Airways I don't have time for shower
I've only got about 20 minutes before my
flight so I'm in here getting drunk
getting a pastry and then getting on a
flight back to Manchester I'm tired this
is what I feel no I feel like there's
miles getting eaten by yet like ah on
the plane I got a free toothbrush
usually I just don't buy off like a
pounder sort of thing but I'm gonna try
and use this which looks like it's going
to shred my gums and this is the size of
the toothpaste dispenser of girls so I'm
going to try and attempt this work oh my
gosh look at this this glass table was
made for me
look at that don't even know what I put
it on I'm probably putting on ballsack
hitching cream to my teeth rather than
that but uh wish me look this is going
to her oh god oh
but yep that is one hell of a bristle
brush and get a pastry and run away in
style
I've got a feeling this hot chocolate is
I'm going to taste too good so let's
give it a review British Airways large
chocolate that had to press the button
twice to pump out that's going to get
with a hot a little bit it's medium warm
you ready
I just brush my teeth as well so this is
an unfair review try again
Jackie because a solid eight now as
livable was on holiday again this was
all great book for the weather I get a
one out of ten that is absolutely
disgusting there's no way the chances of
this make sense but when I flew out to
LA just recently I got playing next one
on there he was a fun and cuz like his
kids watch my videos boy he looked out I
was moving his entire family out to LA
it turns out when he last flew out to LA
before was seeing each other then he was
on the plane sat next to my sister when
she came at with India to hang out with
me and I've just gotten the flight to
Manchester and the dude still there I
got on and I just looked up news like
there's no way like the creepiest
circumstances ever like well not with
just you can't make this ship so to him
hello to his family hello you know who
you are
camera B name absolutely jet like this
shit right now but what the hell the
chances he met my sister's sex my sister
then when I fly there he was sat next to
me and now he's on the same plane on the
way back I like our self in LA you can
see the entire city Sofia siege is about
three feet
beautiful I like how the first thing I
could smell when I got off the plane in
Manchester is a horse ship a cowshed
what just another miserable day in
England Annette
it's just the whole fucking day oh man
does if you're good to be home this
victory spouts so much every time I get
to my house I'm like stuck in a one
floor apartment in LA which is like I'm
like Thomas really good it is until you
think of the fact that I spent three
fucking years building a dream house I'm
hardly ever here so I'm home I'm home

missed this bed I'm really comfy bed in
LA but isn't seven foot fucking wide oh
