the power of Christ compels the
protector with anything it feels good to
remove the potato within breakfast time
water up top on the rooftop getting some
Sun because we've only got an hour
before I have to go to a meeting so it
could be quick today it'll be quick if
you did see that time that is 150 - 150
- in the afternoon I only just go see I
set my alarm for you know half-past ten
but there's a thing called a snooze
button and then you can turn off the
alarm
which is a really bad thing and I did
that so now that's why I'm awake right
now you have to come up here and see
anyone else yesterday someone left a hat
there Oh someone's been up there but no
I've never never quite bumped into an
arm it's like my own private domain I
love it I've received a package
expecting anything like usual so it's
probably of raisable I'm gonna open that
when I get back
I have faith in dogs hanging out of
windows weak but that dog is leaning Oh
tip we've been following this cow for
the past like 30 seconds and that dog
looks like he's ready to bounce
I hope to god that this guy's not gonna
fall on the highway oh my god it's just
an eagle is it a lek I mean out that
yeah too late oh my god this is just
good it this is a recipe for disaster

ten seconds to me of your car crash now
cuz I lost all that footage exactly so
10-second summary or 15 seconds from
your car
so this lady I don't know in time I know

are seven is she driving like a fairly
new
four-wheeler yeah I'm in the left lane
here right here yeah

know on traffic doing some illegal shit
and I can say there's this much room
between me in the car yeah she bounces
and Fermi like pop I hit her fairly like
that and she goes absolutely fucking
bonkers she dumps out of her car lady
we haven't even got another fucking car
like you mean calm down I'm like well

insurance and then what happened then a
homeless man with no shoes comes up like

raised his hands I was like I raised my
hands but not to hit her just be like
crazy

and like the summer potato his Tom's
hair looks like this I am kicking back
on the sofa just I'm just relaxing and
I'm watching Forrest Gump spoiler it's
kind of at the end so far as Gump has a
plot twist of actually first-come has
many pop twists in twists twists in his
life but either way I'm just kicking
back watching some Forrest Gump and
today has been awesome worked on a bunch
of crazy awesome shit and it's just nice
to relax because on March 11th when I'm
gonna start traveling a lot more
everything's gonna get crazy so it's
really nice to just kick back
as much as I love curry oil based foods
and me
don't mix whatsoever so tomorrow is
gonna be great
now do the vlog do today talking about
snowboard and how I can't go for three
weeks and all that but I didn't quite
explain why I'm sorry but I almost
missed a clip or something because
basically I go to mount high it's an
hour-and-a-half way really close to me
to go snowboard and that's what I was
really getting into and I was hoping
whilst I was here to rent a car or buy a
car like like I was doing and just keep
going back and forth to snowboarding I
was potentially even gonna stay it like
a lodge there and stay for a few days or
like a week or something and just get
really really really really good at
snowboarding and get some amazing
footage for you guys but I got an email
from my hand like the resort saying
there are close to three weeks because
they've got no snow the temperatures are
so warm that all the snow on the
mountain has like pretty much just
melted even though half of it is fake
snow even the real snow on the top has
just gone but sure that means yeah I
just can't go snowboard and that's why I
said I'd go out to Utah shonduras
and he actually text me today and we got
talking and he's welcomed me back out as
an invite to go and hang out with him so
we may be going back to Utah soon and to
everyone I met as fans in Taco Bell I
might see your faces again soon maybe
another Meetup I'm doing it actually
doing it I'm committing to watching
Marvel's agents of shield I've never
seen it so I'm committing to it even my
mom watching his Netflix show and I've
just never decided to get into it
because I thought it was too cheesy or
it might be like really shit but since
I'm watching Avengers Assemble the
actual animated show I thought why not
just give this a try so I'm gonna give
it a go you guys recommended it quite a
while back when I was like please leave
some comments down down below of like
Netflix show so thanks for
recommendations mom I'm watching this
basically because of you I love your
