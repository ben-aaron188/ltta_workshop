Razer HQ it's been a good day but it's
time for the hour-and-a-half drive home

unfortunately because I went down to
raises so late I missed out on the
opportunity I'm get it done bought man I
got back in like 30 minutes it took me
an hour and a half to drive then I got
back in 30 minutes not friggin bad I
managed to steal myself some swag and
some spiky you guys oh yeah man it is so
nice to come out of a clean apartment
just interesting no that's actually
clean clothes but damn look at this is
also clean also tidy then new sofa a
dog's fool this is what I'm talking
about the apartment is on fleek yeah did
you say that on fleek right now oh boys
are we gonna win are we gonna win enough
can we win enough let's wouldn't that
please win enough oh I just won three
dogs so because of everyone running it
raving me about these naked juices I've
read up about it apparently these ones
are the ones you're not supposed to get
because they're not good for you but
these ones ah now look away these on
this list so far that I'm looking like
are the orange juices and the ones that
I like so basically the ones that I'm
drinking are the good ones whereas these
ones are not it still doesn't answer my
question as to whether or not they're
actually good for you or not or like
it's not in the case of oh I'm just
gonna eat so drink them to be healthy
already today it's just I'm trying to
replace the coca-cola route of my life
or whatever fent essentially narrowed it
down to caffeine I'm trying to replace
the caffeine in my life it's something
else
you know like energy wise and that
energy is from natural energy like
fruits and stuff so these naked juices
seem to be still the right answer
however they're very expensive like you
could get 24 cans of coke for $5 at
Walmart whereas if you buy one of these
bottles they're like $4 themselves
that's why I only have one a day so
expensive bought at least I'm not
following my body with caffeine and I'm
having healthy stuff instead just trying
to work out what I should actually be
either changing it from this Naked Juice
to something else I'll just sticking
with
I don't know if you guys got suggestions
please leave it down below but on that
note guys I am extremely tired it is
12:30 9 in the morning yes that is right
it isn't the morning so I'm gonna go to
bed get up at 9 o'clock maybe try and
get my hair cooked I really want to get
