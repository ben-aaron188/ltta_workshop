towards the hills the GPS says it's up
ahead of me so fingers crossed it's
sending me in the right direction I have
been jamming chill into some tunes
driving at 50 miles
55 55 60 miles per hour that's the speed
limit and it's been awesome good drive

this is fucking sweet but randomly
yesterday was just like feel like oh
it's no border than today I was like
let's go snowboarding so there I am
snowboarding sighs for the record there
is no handle on that you can't just sell
it and hope you don't fall and you hold
on to your snowboard with one foot just
sits there while you rest it like that
so this is me shredding the gnar
watching some peeps fall over is he is
he got this has he got this as he got
this has he got this oh she don't how do
you know
double kill bro ripped my ankle ankles
are on fire that was so much fun you
know excuse my language that was
actually so much fun but now let's get
some food some water energy in me and
hit the slopes again because I'm getting
better and better and better and I want
to get really damn good oh my god it's
such a good day on the slopes like it's
been so fucking good definitely to come
back tomorrow it's four o'clock now I've
been snowboarding for three hours but
yeah it takes your toe in your ankles
that's for sure
no one wanted me of that fact that's so
crazy if my phone is at 50% battery and
because of the cold it's eating away at
my battery and my phone just keeps
randomly turned off so got a lot of
snack
get them calories back inside me and go
and hit the slopes again I just had a
bath yes a bath well caught a bit of Sun
today I can't read my faces at about and
now and the stream since yes colo
because I always play csgo ATO like a
shitload but no one ever sees it because
like I leave a stream it and never put
it in the vlog or whatever reason but
gonna stream it oh shit
Chloe she is getting cold I don't know
if you can see that I got busy it is
still four o'clock in the afternoon and
it's still rap so this is about the big
big slope that everyone goes on which it
stopped I don't still going and this is
the one that I'm on like the small one
and I'm doing this we're in the more I
got to top of here right now to be right
down
but then there's one if you get SoCo you
take over here and walk how steep that
is oh shit people bomb bound down isn't
learn about to die my phone battery was
on 75% it's now 125 this is how badly
the cold weather just fucks with your
battery so look like I got the spare
mole free in the back so I could just
charge you up but man I cannot wait to
come back here with a GoPro so you could
choose me or Wednesday I'm going to come
back but we'll come back with a GoPro
and just just own it or but the GoPro on
the stick I could do it on the helmet
we'll just I think the footage to be
corrupt so I'm gonna go pro with a stick
like a selfie stick and just try and
pull me down to see how it goes
well I can only get about five and a
half hour lesson don't run him over
I am masterfully enjoying this and that
was it final run of the day absolutely
awesome probably got about 10 runs in
right uncle is absolutely my a my that
was an awesome day
well my first day on Mountain High was
absolutely epic
definitely definitely coming back it's
quite a fire drive away actually I did
it in an hour and a half not two hours
but wait worth it just just phenomenal
come on it's icicles I had to steal one
I'm gonna have to impale what is it what
was that until dawn until dawn shit
going down
hey it's an ice spear I couldn't help it
I found more I have an idea took the
whole thing off watch my hand get stuck
to it like I'm smashing windows back
here run okay that's the best way to get
down this path which is just made of ice
that is so cheating I definitely made
the right decision with getting a 4x4
because this is just ice a car park you
would have potentially said Wow
beautiful I'm gonna see that on the
drive home anytime right but yeah I
don't know got in like a Mustang or a
sports car something like that it would
have just been a terrible hotel but I do
I look like a nukes just going on it's
awesome the background is so fucking
nice it's not even kidding just though
they're putting all my stuff away look
at the sky it's on fire
this is no color filter effect holy shit
this is absolutely beautiful
holy shit the roads are so fucking I see
I'm gonna die one way or another here
since oh let's just pray fall out the
best it says exit this way so I'm just
gonna follow wherever the hell is
telling me to go warning 30 minute delay
ahead I was like what the fuck oh yeah
I'm coming to LA so unfortunately yeah
I'm sticking this cute hour and 15
minute drive home from El snowboarding
my legs are killing me
from one snowboarding and two non-stop B
plug before this shit Kizer out and
non-stop stop it and start next oh yeah
either way I don't need Huber's to come
and get me groceries anymore so which
get some milk some drinks whatever fuck
I need because I'm gonna go and get in
the bath and I well I decided that I
need to have better snacks in my house
so I decided bread and crisps krispies
I'm gonna survive for the next month
riperoni boys is a car park there so
we're most likely gonna hit it KITT did
me good I'm proud look I didn't take out
cup see sparkles and he's be at five
okay I'm joking it's just that that's a
very female car and I love that captain
sparkles got one of them everyone going
tweak up to sparkles saying that's an
ass guy you've got that does it come
with a hairdryer well would you look at

to just get out of the apartment go get
a Sun Tan and you'd be outdoors but
there's never really much to do and I
like just get stuck in traffic so you
have to drive two hours out the way to
then go snowboarding which was so worth
it okay both you open one step this
world so much this point on is dead okay

hence the stand you can't miss the step
up its the most important you have to
