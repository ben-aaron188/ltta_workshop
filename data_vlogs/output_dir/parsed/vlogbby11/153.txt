gonna take off all my makeup and redo it
wait this ah I just took off the I just
took up the look at my eyebrow it looks
like oh the things I do for videos
literally looks like I just like made
out with someone or I have a disease Oh
oh man hey guys so update time it's a
bit later I had some lunch and now I'm
going to redo my makeup because clearly
what I had earlier like that's cute mom
but I'm not about to do that like that's
not key I'm just gonna I'm Saki
um yeah definitely reduce makeup real
quick
so yeah let's do that it's like a mess
from filming so literally guys this
stuff tasted disgusting oh my god we
need some makeup it's a manual this
nonsense at this no that was too dark
hold on there we go okay so we have
foundation let's do that also going to
watch Mia's vlog while I did my makeups
let's do that I mean love you memes
subscribe so much freakin better oh my
god you guys like mm-hmm
also I think I might wear some fake
glasses today I think that could be cute
let's try it out they're like kind of
really dirty though so let me clean that
real quick this cute is it ugly
hold on I kind of look you like it
without better okay we're not gonna wear
this today okay
Oh update time is currently can you even
see that probably not I don't know maybe
349 p.m. Jessica yawa I order this paid
for myself i order this um i think last
week kind of impulsive just because i
couldn't find this lipstick anywhere and
also you know it it's like it's just
time for you like i'm sooo exotic place
an order on Kylie cosmetics normally
these boxes are black but this one's
pink I think for her birthday clock
change I did not order from that I don't
think so okay haha I'm free unboxing all
you should never get scissors we make it
so much harder for myself
than just you know getting scissors wait
for it oh oh I love I mean obviously
make sense but I love the pink so much
more than the black so I ordered two lip
kits I got my usual the coke okay one
this one is my all-time favorite lip kit
from her it seriously I've gone through
like two of these I think just like it's
honestly be freaking perfect nude pink
color for me so I love it and then I saw
this one online and it's the only okay
the only thing I don't like about Kylie
cosmetics is I swear the pictures online
versus the box color versus the actual
color of the lipstick are all very
different online I'm pretty sure
high-maintenance looked lighter than
coke okay and debating between this it
looks so much darker but okay I'm really
like those are those are literally two
different colors I think I don't know
let me swatch this on yo this one is
real pretty ooh I like that one work so
watch time let's be a PD career that
one's real it's more pink it is more
pink so I guess the box makes sense okay
wait for it okay it's just actually
perfect I feel like this is slightly
darker than in person but they're pretty
dings similar honestly so the right one
the right two are high maintenance and
then the left two are coke okay so it's
like the lip liners on the outside
they're like they're both really similar
but the right one is definitely more P I
still think I like coke okay the best
eye maintenance is definitely lighter
than Posie K which was a little too dark
for me see this looks like freakin
purple to me this looks like Brown
that's like a light people whatever but
yeah no so now oh wait I can do it key
to this is you have to do a really thin
layer cuz otherwise it's like it's just
not cute
we're at the base blaze oh yeah can I
get two grande iced almond milk lattes
with double extra caramel drizzle yeah
I'm so excited
the pumpkin guys PSA pummels iced latte
is here it's gone dawn Serena we're
gonna have to start goodness I've always
liked them I don't love that fun tax
actually make those pumpkin scones
actually actually makes them better like
she has the recipe and makes them and I
really good I've never tried that iced
pumpkin meet me either I feel like that
could be good I hope it gets cold soon I

Cheers Yas I mean when I like let's get
coffee let's go shopping not like we
really know that most of us but we're
like let's go to urban like why not I've
decided like what every okay every time
you buy something new you should get rid
of something in your closet so then so I
only have a certain amount of hanger
it's now like I redid my whole closet a
certain amount of hangers and that's it
but you know the problem is you've been
cleaning and purging a lot of stuff and
I haven't so should I be here probably
myself I feel like I don't know buy it
would you honestly I'm like or should I
just like having its bread I stuck with
like tags on it you should sell it maybe
economically friendly oh these are cute

a hoodie for this one I really wanted
this one in it but they only have a
small but it looks big I mean it might
fit maybe I you know let me try that one
