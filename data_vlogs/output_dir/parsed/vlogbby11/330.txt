I really don't even know where to start
this at all so if you didn't know I was
on tour for six weeks with a full-screen
line for the girls night into her
actually got home last night
and it feels so weird it feels like time
stopped it feels like I was just here
but I wasn't going into this we had a
rough start being on tour is such a
weird experience because you basically
are living with strangers for six weeks
all in a bus and you get close really
quick you're on stage every night you're
meeting people it's just we it's so
weird and it's not normal but that
becomes the new normal there's so many
little things that I'm gonna miss waking
up I'm in my bunk
there's our home disgusting green rooms
getting coffee every morning we got the
goods heck yes we do you have to get
your your clothes are all under the bys
last time getting my stuff out from
under the bun
you know you you visit places and cities
that you never ever thought you ever
could
this is legit and you meet people that
you never would have met your it's
something that log and it's such a weird
thing
you don't feels literally like they have
become family I've never really said
that before I'm actually very good
friends and I really of them they just
like a Twitter surprise that I'm coming
back to reality it was a lot harder than
I thought it would be
it literally feels like a dream you know
but it was yet just the other day
literally just the other day I've
learned so much and I'm so grateful for
that I've learned I'm a lot more
independent than I thought I've learned
a lot of patience a lot of patience I've
gained confidence I have seven daughters
out here and
three excellent men that have had our
backs and been there for us through
everything I mean I've been on a tour
before but there's something about this
one I've never really felt so emotional
sleeper tours were like I've never done
before it's really hard oh I've learned
so much about myself that I didn't know
as possible and I didn't expect that and
there are certain people who they
probably don't even know how much they
helped me
and I want to see you
Alicia and beautiful blissful energetic
mysterious woman there's things that I
don't think I ever expected I'll give
you that I've seen and I love it I love
every bit of it the last chance
no you're gonna miss us
yes just you though just me
blaah inception I am so grateful for
this tour and what I've learned and who
had Metz I know it's not normal to feel
this emotional after doing something
like this things up but yet I'm grateful
because that means that it meant
something and it was special last my
king are we ready
that's 15 minutes guys I feel like
something's missing being a home and
freaking crying oh my god
all right look for each other or one
other sex will be a holiday
Oh
you know just being on the sidelines and
watching each other's set to my Mac
babies I love you so much
you don't even know without you guys
watching my videos I wouldn't be on tour
I wouldn't have had this amazing
experience thank you thank you thank you
for this life I wouldn't be doing any of
this without you
Mike to her family I love you so much
you don't even know I mean hopefully you
know after this video cuz you're like -
dude she's crying but like yo it's real
give me like 30 seconds I'm good so far
and it's weird looking back to day one I
have been waiting to announcement for
such a long time you guys don't even
know I am who are looking back I
wouldn't change anything because that's
the reason why we're such a
dysfunctional Jesse Taylor functioning
am i killing it okay family we're happy
go side in addition and who knows maybe
this is the start of something bigger
and better
see your quote a good torque I can't
well you're like your quote no you've
said it it's a very like receive man a
good tour is that toward success we've
all been very sad at one point
