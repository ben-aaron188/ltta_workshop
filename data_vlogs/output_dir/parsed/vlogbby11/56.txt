real wrong when we were trying to prep
for filming one of my favorite coffee

literally had this thing for years
r.i.p what happened oh no oh no dang it
was this not focus all time it didn't
make it let's just say a prank gone
wrong that's all we can say what prank
did I say prank no okay well actually
let's talk about this so Alicia is so
smart let's just let's say you know what
let's let's this week's video is most
definitely a prank video which means
it's a roommate boys video and you guys
have been wanting this for so long cuz
it's been since Christmas that I've done
one I should have uploaded this video on
this past Sunday but I thought I had
another week before April Fool's when I
looked at the calendar one day just one
one random day it realized was like oh
my god April Fool's lands on a Sunday
and I was like I can't upload my prank
video the day of April Fool's cuz that's
pointless because no one would get ideas
for pranks so we're hustling to get the
video done I wanted to get it up today
Wednesday so that way you like you guys
still had time to see it before I go
Fool's and then now looking at my
schedule to see just that I am pretty
busy lately it's a Wednesday today we're
not gonna get it up today so I'm hoping
I can upload it Friday but dang so
frustrating oh my god guys also why
my gosh these smell amazing they look
amazing all I want to do is eat
literally all of them like all 12
although I don't even want to imagine
how many calories that is okay Siri how
many calories are in one Krispy Kremes
glazed donut okay okay we're good we're
good oh my god okay there are according
to this website which I have no idea if
it's valid 200 calories oh my god you
guys I swear though the screen before
that literally said a thousand calories
and I was a bit I was gonna be shook I
was gonna be so freakin shucks that's
that's like a cheese cake slicing what
about you guys don't care probably don't
care but what am i doing update time

there's just one prank that involves a
sandwich and I'm not kidding ash and I
are literally like willingly eating it
it tastes good you know I bought new
hummus and it's roasting garlic huh got
a real good also I told Ashley that
those donuts for 200 calories and she
was like no they're 350 calories
apparently a sign said that I was there
the story last night it was a huge line
it took me like I think 45 minutes and I
was staring at the signs and I'm pretty
sure it's at 350

pretty sure it was ugly I don't know
