I'm rich felonious and your strategy reporter at Business Insider I first heard about hirevue when I wrote about Unilever's experiment in hiring Unilever is one of many large companies that is incorporating artificial intelligence into their recruitment efforts hirevue uses video analysis to screen employees and rate them before a recruiter even gets to look at their interviews I'm Lauren Larson I'm the chief technology officer at hirevue hirevue has a platform that simplifies the job interviewing process the most common use of that is what we call it on-demand interview where you create a set of questions they respond on video and then we use artificial intelligence algorithms to evaluate their performance and then we analyze the interview and predict their performance based on the interview so hirevue set up an application for me where it was 11 interview questions I used my iPhone the entire time I felt very awkward and very self-conscious because I was looking at a video of myself and then we made an analysis of the features that are important for that job and produced what we call an insight score which is essentially his ranking compared to all of the other candidates that we've seen well fortunately rich did really well in this interview basically what this is just doing is looking for things like eye contact enthusiasm if this is someone who's going to be working with clients face to face do they smile or are they downcast are they looking away from the camera so some of my skepticism was averted when I actually saw how the product worked the Machine is gonna look at twenty five thousand different features and complex relationships between those the might see things that I'm not able to see as a human a eye and recruiting at this point is still basically in its infancy I think what higher view is doing is interesting they're going into uncharted territory it seems that a lot of large companies are happy with the results of the candidates that we screen for this he was second he had a 65% insight score so we actually wanna make him an offer
