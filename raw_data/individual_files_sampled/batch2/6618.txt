Thank You chairman Grassley and ranking ranking member Feinstein members of the committee my name is Christine Blasi Ford I'm a professor of psychology at Palo Alto University and a research psychologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine I won't detail my educational background since it's already been summarized I have been married to Russell Ford since 2002 and we have two children I am here today not because I want to be I am terrified I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Cavanaugh and I were in high school I've described the events publicly before I summarized them in my letter to ranking member Feinstein and again in a letter to chairman Grassley I understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact that it has had on my life in Bethesda Maryland from 1978 to 1984 holding arms is an all-girls school that opened in 1901 during my time at the school land in school Georgetown Prep Gonzaga high school as well as our country clubs and other places where kids and families socialized this is how I met Brett Kavanaugh the boy who sexually assaulted me during my freshman and sophomore school years when I was 14 and 15 years old my group of friends intersected with Brett and his friends for a short period of time I had been friendly with a classmate of Brett's for a short time during my freshman and sophomore year and it was through that connection that I attended a number of parties that Brett also attended we did not know each other well but I knew him and he knew me in the summer of 1982 like most summers I spent most every day at the Columbia Country Club in Chevy Chase Maryland swimming and practicing diving one evening that summer after a day of diving at the club I attended a small gathering at a house in the Bethesda area there were four boys I remember specifically being at the house Brett Kavanaugh mark judge a boy named PJ and one other boy whose name I cannot recall I also remember my friend Leland attending I do not remember all of the details of how that gathering came together but like many that summer it was almost surely a spur-of-the-moment gathering I truly wish I could be more helpful with more detailed answers to all of the questions that have and will be asked about how I got to the party and where it took place and so forth I don't have all the answers and I don't remember as much as I would like to but the details that about that night that bring me here today are the ones I will never forget they have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult when I got to the small gathering people were drinking beer in a small living room family room type area on the first floor of the house I drink one beer Brett and Mark were visibly drunk early in the evening I went up a very narrow set of stairs leading from the living room to a second floor to use the restroom when I got to the top of the stairs I was pushed from behind into a bedroom across from the bathroom I couldn't see who pushed me Brett and Mark came into the bedroom and locked the door behind them there was music playing in the bedroom it was turned up louder by either Brett or mark once we were in the room I was pushed on to the bed and Brett got on top of me he began running his hands over my body and grinding into me I yelled hoping that someone downstairs might hear me and I tried to get away from him but his weight was heavy Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes he had a hard time because he was very inebriated and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit underneath my clothing I believed he was going to rape me I tried to yell for help when I did Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from yelling this is what terrified me the most and has had the most lasting impact on my life it was hard for me to breathe and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me both Brett and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack they seemed to be having a very good time mark seemed ambivalent at times urging Brett on and at times telling him to stop a couple of times I made eye contact with Mark and thought he might try to help me but he did not during this assault mark came over and jumped on the bed twice while Brett was on top of me and the last time that he did this we toppled over and Brett was no longer on top I was able to get up and run out of the room directly across from the bedroom was a small bathroom I ran inside the bathroom and locked the door I waited until I heard Brett and Mark leave the bedroom laughing and loudly walked down the narrow stairway pinballing off the walls on the way down I waited and when I did not hear them come back up the stairs I left the bathroom went down the same stairwell through the living room and left the house I remember being on the street and feeling this enormous sense of relief that I had escaped that house and that Brett and Mark were not coming outside after me Brett's assault on me dropped drastically altered my life for a very long time I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone these details I did not want to tell my parents that I at age 15 was in a house without any parents present drinking beer with boys I convinced myself that because Brett did not rape me I should just move on and just pretend that it didn't happen over the years I told very very few friends that I had this traumatic experience I told my husband before we were married that I had experienced a sexual assault I had never told the details to anyone the specific details until May 2012 during a couples counseling session the reason this came up in counseling is that my husband and I had completed a very extensive very long remodel of our home and I insisted on a second front door an idea that he and others disagreed with and could not understand in explaining why I wanted a second front door I began to describe the assault in detail I recall saying that the boy who assaulted me could someday be on the US Supreme Court and spoke a bit about his background at an elitist all-boys School in Bethesda Maryland my husband recalls that I named my attacker as Brett Kavanaugh after that May 2012 therapy session I did my best to ignore the memories of the assault because we're counting them caused me to relive the experience and caused panic and anxiety occasionally I would discuss the assault in an individual therapy session but talking about it caused more reliving of the trauma so I tried not to think about it or discuss it but over the years I went through periods where I thought about the attack I confided in some close friends that I had had an experience with sexual assault occasionally I stated that my assailant was a prominent lawyer or judge but I did not use his name I do not recall each person I spoke to about Brett's assault and some friends have reminded me of these conversations since the publication of the Washington Post story on September 16 2018 but until July 2018 I had never named mr. Kavanagh as my attacker outside of therapy this changed in early July 2018 I saw Press report stating that Brett Kavanaugh was on the short list of a list of very well qualified Supreme Court nominees I thought it was my civic duty to relay the information I had about mr. Cavanaugh's conduct so that those considering his nomination would know about this assault on July 6 I had a sense of urgency to relay the information to the Senate and the president as soon as possible before a nominee was selected I did not know how specifically to do this I called my congressional representative and let her receptionist know that someone on the president's shortlist had attacked me I also sent a message to the encrypted Washington Post cop potential tip wine I did not use my name but I provided the names of Brett Kavanaugh and Mark judge I stated that mr. Kavanaugh had assaulted me in the 1980s in Maryland this was an extremely hard thing for me to do but I felt that I couldn't not do it over the next two days I told a couple of close friends on the beach in Aptos California that mr. Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted me I was very conflicted as to whether to speak out on July 9th I received a return phone call from the office of congresswoman Anna Eshoo after mr. Kavanaugh had become the nominee I met with her staff on July 18th and with her on July 20th describing the assault and discussing my fears about coming forward later we discussed the possibility of sending a letter to ranking member Feinstein who is one of my state senators describing what occurred my understanding is that representative issues office delivered a copy of my letter to senator Feinstein's office on July 30th the letter included my name but also a request that it be kept confidential my hope was that providing the information confidentially would be sufficient to allow the Senate to consider mr. Kavanaugh as serious misconduct without having to make myself my family or anyone's family vulnerable to the personal attacks and invasions of privacy that we have faced since my name became public in a letter dated August 31st senator Feinstein wrote that she would not share the letter without my explicit consent and I appreciated this commitment sexual assault victims should be able to decide for themselves when and whether their private experience has made public as the hearing date got closer I struggled with a terrible choice do I share the facts with the Senate and put myself and my family in the public spotlight or do I preserve our privacy and allow the Senate to make its decision without knowing the full truth of his past behaviors I agonized daily with this decision throughout August and September 7 2018 the sense of duty that originally moated me motivated me to reach out confidentially to the Washington Post and to Anna issues office when there was still a list of extremely qualified candidates and to senator Feinstein was always there but my fears of the consequences of speaking out started to exponentially increase during August 2018 the Press reported that mr. Cavanaugh's confirmation was virtually certain persons painted him as a champion of women's rights and empowerment and I believed that if I came forward my single voice would be drowned out by a chorus of powerful supporters by the time of the confirmation hearings I had resigned myself to remaining quiet and letting the committee in the Senate make their decision without knowing what mr. Kavanagh had done to me once the press started reporting on the existence of the letter I had sent to senator Feinstein I faced mounting pressure reporters appeared at my home and at my workplace demanding information about the letter in the presence of my graduate students they called my bosses and co-workers and left me many messages making it clear that my name would inevitably be released to the media I decided to speak out publicly to a journalist who had originally responded to the tip I had sent to the Washington Post and who had gained my trust it was important for me to describe the details of the assault in my own words since September 16th the date of the Washington Post story I have experienced an outpouring of support from people in every state of this country thousands and thousands of people who have had their lives dramatically altered by sexual violence have reached out to share their experience and have thanked me for coming forward we have received Herman the support from our friends and our community at the same time my greatest fears have been realized and the reality has been far worse than what I expected my family and I have been the target of constant harassment and death threats and I've been called the most vile and hateful names imaginable these messages were far fewer than the expressions of support have been terrifying and have rocked me to my core people have posted my personal information and that of my parents online on the Internet this has resulted in additional emails calls and threats my family and I were forced to move out of our home since September 16th my family and I have been visiting in various secure locales at time separated and at times together with the help of security guards this past Tuesday evening my work email was hacked and messages were sent out trying to recant Myra scription of the sexual assault apart from the assault itself these past couple of weeks have been the hardest of my life I've had to relive this trauma in front of the world and I've seen my life picked apart by people on television on Twitter other social media other media and in this body who have never met me or spoken with me I have been accused of acting out of partisan political motives those who say that do not know me I am an independent person and I am no one's pawn my motivation and coming forward was to be helpful and to provide facts about how mr. Kavanagh has actions have damaged my life so that you could take into a serious can iteration as you make your decision about how to proceed it is not my responsibility to determine whether mr. Cavanaugh deserves to sit on the Supreme Court my responsibility is to tell you the truth I understand that a professional prosecutor has been hired to ask me questions and I'm committed to doing my very best to answer them I have never been questioned by a prosecutor and I will do my best at the same time because the committee members will be judging my credibility I do hope to be able to engage directly with each of you and at this point I will do my best to answer your questions and would request some caffeine go for something that sounds great look the opening statement was devastating and there's tremendous power in seeing a person with your own eyes and hearing them with your own ears tell that story after watching her tell that story it's already over I mean the fateful decision Cavanaugh made was to whether to lie about it or not lie about it you know maybe maybe he could have survived in some other crazy way if where he came out right in the beginning and said my god I am so sorry for what I did as a 17 year old etc etc and maybe that kind of yeah contrition I don't know I don't know if we could have saved them but but he is now lied on a great number of occasions at different judicial hearings on usually political matters but this is this is too big and does anybody come on guys really anybody watch that and think I know that probably somewhere Corey Lewandowski was going womp womp but outside of the monsters this anybody think that was not credible yeah or that anyone would willingly be it a party to this if they were lying nobody lies that well on the go don't worry we got you covered you can still listen to T YT at our new podcast network find us on Apple podcast at Google Play Store or at TYT comm slash podcast
