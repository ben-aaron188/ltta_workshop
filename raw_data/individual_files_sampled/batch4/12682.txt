Jimmy Kimmel finally goes off last night and Jimmy Kimmel again has become sort of the all heart the representative of all leftist causes so we a couple of weeks ago we broke down detail his lecture on on healthcare reform which was similarly based not on facts but on emotions last night he did a long stick about gun control that was entirely based on emotion and it was really nasty it was really nasty I don't know it was nasty because he doesn't care he cares it's really nasty because he's suggesting the you and I don't care it doesn't matter that you lost sleep last night and I lost sleep last night because of what happened it doesn't matter that we're all heartbroken over what happened we don't agree with Jimmy Kimmel's evidence list suggestions about gun control that means that we don't care we're bad people you want to know why the country is not unified it's because it's stuff like this is not because we disagree on policy we've been disagreeing about policy forever it's because there are certain people in the American public discourse who feel it necessary to imputed motives to people who disagree and that's what Kimmel is doing here so here's Jimmy Kimmel we're gonna go through his entire lecture so here he starts off ripping into Americans who disagree well hello everyone here we are again in the aftermath of another terrible inexplicable shocking and painful tragedy this time in Las Vegas which happens to be my hometown and cletus from town Cleo seniors hometown and as you know at least 59 people are dead hundreds of people were wounded in what they say was the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history coming about a year and a half after the previous deadliest mass shooting in modern American history in Orlando with 49 people lost their lives and of course we pray for the victims and for their families and friends and we wonder why even though there's probably no way to ever know why a human being would do something like this to other human beings or at a concert having fun and listening to music Jason Aldean was on stage Luke combs who is here with us tonight he played the show too and obviously no one could have ever expected that something terrible would happen but it did a very sick person smuggled 17 guns into his hotel room and smashed up the windows started firing indiscriminately from the 32nd floor into a crowd of 22,000 people across the street and as a result of that this morning we have children without parents and fathers without sons mothers without daughters we lost two police officers we lost a nurse from Tennessee okay so oh this is fine right everything that he's saying here is true all of it we all feel the same thing right we're all feeling this he doesn't it's not a matter of him grasping the emotion and nobody else getting the emotion we're all feeling this some of us show it more on the surface than others but what he is saying is obviously true but what's gonna be nasty is when he swivels this and then he uses it as a club to beat his political opponents on gun control which happens momentarily here sure from a local school here in Manhattan Beach and it's a kind of thing that it it makes you want to throw up or or give up it's too much even process all these devastated families do not have to live with this pain forever because one person with a violent and insane voice in his head managed to stockpile a connection of a collection of high-powered rifles and use them to shoot people the guy was an accountant he had no criminal record his brother who lives in Florida seems totally shocked genuinely dumbfounded he said he saw no sign of any of this the owner of the store that sold the killer some of the rifle said he passed the government mandated background check oh he was in this line is it right there for a second he's giving all the facts what are these facts he just he passed a government mandated background check no history of mental illness his brother didn't know anything was wrong with him what exactly would stop something like this right short of full gun confiscation which is really what the left wants and we'll talk about the the possibility of that in a second short of that which no one on the Left will admit they want but they actually do want you know they protest every time you say this if you say the left wants full-scale gun confiscation Hillary Clinton I'll tell you know Joe Biden will tell you no but short of full-scale gun gun confiscation what exactly would Jimmy can will do in a situation like this he's gonna spell it a bunch of policies that have nothing to do with what actually happened in Vegas now wasn't on any watch list and I've been a religious of political extremists came out of nowhere and because of that because there weren't any of the usual signs you know I've been reading comments when people say this is terrible but there's nothing we can do about it but I disagree with that intensely because of course there's something we can do about it there are a lot of things we can do about it but we don't which is interesting because when someone with a beard attacks us we tap phones we invoke travel bans we build walls we take every possible precaution to make sure it doesn't happen again but when an American buys a gun and kills other Americans then there's nothing we can do about that okay so positive and so Charles cook over at National Review makes a fantastic points about this which is Kimmel's now undercutting his own case right because Kimmel opposes all those things he opposes travel bans he opposes walls he opposes phone tapping I don't assume that he doesn't care about terrorism I'm sure he does he just disagrees about the policy so why can't he grant us the same sort of credibility we care about what happened in Vegas we just disagree on the policy beyond that the fact is that when you're talking about somebody who's a foreigner coming into the United States and murdering people that person does not have the same rights that you or I do as American citizens so the sort of measures that we have available to us to stop them are different than the sort of measures available to us to stop American citizens who are using freedom in evil ways in order to harm other people okay Kimmel continues Second Amendment I guess our forefathers wanted us to have a k47 is the argument I assume Orlando Newtown Aurora San Bernardino every one of these shootings the murder used automatic or semi-automatic rifles which are not weapons you use for self-defense their weapons and designs that kill okay not true okay so number one the founders would have wanted us to have ar-15s because the fact is that back in the day all the weapons that people have were military-grade weapons ready a musket was a military grade weapon now ar-15s aren't even military grade yesterday as I said I made the mistake about comparing basically in m16 which has burst fire capacity with a civilian with a civilian AR right that's not that's not correct I was wrong about that civilian guns are very different from issue guns for him to say that the Second Amendment doesn't cover things like ar-15s a semi-automatic rifle is akin to me saying that the First Amendment doesn't cover TV because the founders had never seen a TV wouldn't know what it looked like and don't understand how it works it's just a silly argument as far as the idea that ARS are not used for home defense again asinine I know I have a bunch of friends who haze who use ARS for home defense now you can find stories awr hawkins over a Breitbart has a good good roundup of people who have used ARS for defense for self defense it happens on a relatively frequent basis okay but again you wouldn't expect yume camel to know all of this because here is where the left's version of common sense means they have to be completely disconnected from the fact arch numbers of people in the shortest possible amount of time this guy reportedly had ten of them in his room apparently legally at least some of them were there illegally why is that allowed I don't know why our so-called leaders continue it allow this to happen or maybe a better question why do we continue to let them to allow it to happen five people got shot in Lawrence Kansas last night three of them died it didn't even make a blip because this is just a regular part of our lives now and you know what will happen will pray for Las Vegas some of us will get motivated some of us won't get motivated though bills will be written they'll be watered down they'll fail the NRA will smother at all with money and overtime we'll get distracted will mow on to the next thing and then it will happen again and again and last night one second so again what he's saying here is also not true when he says the NRA is gonna smother it money the NRA is not among the top dozen spenders in the American political system the NRA does not give a lot of money to politicians the NRA is a very powerful force because there are millions of people who are members millions of people right the reason the American people are not willing to to elect representatives to repeal some of their Second Amendment rights is because we're not willing to do that now cuz the NRA is bribing people it's amazing Democrats never make this argument unions that give tons of cash to Democrats the unions are bribing people but they make this argue about the NRA that is actively not bribing people so back to Jimmy Kimmel so Kimmel continues along these lines and you just again all of this is ignorant none of it is based on knowledge about guns or firearms or any of this stuff but this is what passes for brill and common sense in Hollywood House press secretary Sarah sander said this is not the time or actually it was today this morning she said it was not the time for political debate and I don't know we have 59 innocent people dead it wasn't their time either so I think now is the time for political debate President Trump is visiting Las Vegas on Wednesday he spoke this morning said he's praying for those who lost their lives you know in February he also signed a bill that made it easier for people with severe mental illness to buy guns legally okay this is not true stop it there okay so again this is like number line number eight in this in this little monologue so number one again this idea that people don't care and that's why they don't want to talk policy maybe policy is best talked not when you are passionate about the issue but when you're removed a little bit so that you're not making the sorts of bad arguments Jimmy Kimmel is making right here so the bill again that Trump signed back in February did not was backed by the ACLU it did not in fact make it easier for mentally ill people to purchase guns it said that a judge had to rule you mentally incompetent before you could have your gun taken away or your ability to buy a gun taken away right that's what it says the due process is still a thing okay you don't just get to take somebody's gone away because you're afraid that they may be mentally ill you actually have to show they're mentally ill before you take their gun away people who are you know people in the United States still have rights until due process goes through okay time for a few more falsehoods from Jimmy Kimmel the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Speaker of the House Paul Ryan a number of other lawmakers who won't do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip also sent their thoughts and their posit the idea that the NR a has has anybody's balls in the money clip is just not true it is just not true their constituents don't want them to do the stuff Jimmy Kimmel is talking about because the stuff Jimmy Kimmel is talking about is not correct okay the NRA is not bribing Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell again this is just him attributing bad motives to these politicians they don't really believe what they believe you see they just don't care enough and they'd rather be paid the blood money for dead people in Las Vegas just absurd and now it now he's getting to the point of insulting right because now they're all just weaklings who if they had a shred of heart they would do exactly what Jimmy Kimmel wants prayers today which is is good they should be praying they should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby lobby run this country because it is uh it's so crazy right now there are loopholes in the law that let people avoid background checks if they buy a gun privately from another party if they buy a gun online or at a gun show so I want to show you some reason to pause it again this is the so-called gun show loophole it is not correct okay the gun show loophole is it doesn't exist as I said before if you buy a gun at a gun show from a federally licensed firearms dealer they must do a background check if you buy a gun on the internet it is shipped to a federally licensed firearms dealer you do a check they do a background check before you're allowed to take possession of the gun all of this is true the same law is on the books now that was on the books 50 years ago if I sell you a gun there's no way to mandate that I do a background check because again I have like one gun and I'm selling it to you or god forbid I die and I passed my guns onto my wife right this is hand-to-hand transfers not the same thing now you can make the case by the way that we should force people to do background checks I suppose I think would be an effective but you can make the case but it has nothing do with happen in Vegas he admitted earlier here that all these guns were basically legally bought so they again doesn't make any sense it's just him saying that he feels more than you feel and therefore he knows more than you know based on the Senators who days after the shooting Orlando voted against a bill that would have closed those loopholes these are the 56 senators who didn't want to do anything about that now 90% of Democrats I'm not talking about politicians here I'm talking about people and 70 77 percent of Republicans support background checks at gun shows 89 percent of Republicans and Democrats are in favor of restricting gun ownership for the mentally ill but not this gang they voted against both of those things so with all due respect your thoughts and your prayers are insufficient and by the way the House of Representatives will be voting on a piece of legislation who died and made Jimmy Kimmel God who who's Jimmy Kimmel to decide whether their thoughts your thoughts and your prayers are insufficient so your thoughts in your prayers are only sufficient if you do what Jimmy Kimmel wants you to do that's the way this works now who died made him Jesus like it really how did this work exactly the Jimmy Kimmel gets to be the great moral arbiter of our time a late night talk show host who used to host the man show with women bouncing on trampolines he's now the great of what constitutes morality and politics and if you disagree with him your thoughts and prayers are insufficient it doesn't matter that you were fervently praying for the victims doesn't matter that you were donating your time of your blood none of that matters if you disagree with Jimmy Kimmel what you've done today is insufficient you must pay you will burn in the fiery bowels of Jimmy Kimmel's hell just gross this is just gross stuff okay again I'm not doubting Jimmy Kimmel sincerity I believe he is completely sincere I am doubting whether it is moral to down other people's sincerity based on their political viewpoint he continues we it's a bill to legalize the sale of silencers for guns isn't what they're working on we have a major problem with gun violence in this country and I guess they don't care and if I'm wrong on that fine do something about it because I'm sick of it and you know why your gang he's sick of it so I guess we're done here gang I mean as long as he's sick of it I guess that those rights just go out the window again he's bring up silencers and suppressors stupid okay there there is no silencer or suppressor used in this crime and if you use a suppressor which is what what people who don't know they're talking about call a silencer yeah I mean the opposite if your sight if use a silencer which is what a suppressor is all it does is it reduces the the sound from basically a gunshot to a jackhammer so it's still incredibly loud again none of this has to do with anything that just happened in Vegas but Jimmy Kimmel's on a roll now you know bluto's going don't don't let's stop him now just let him let him let him roll again this is he's sick of it he's sick of and then he says and then he talks about how he really wants to do comedy but he can't because he just feels too much so I hate talking about stuff like this I just want to you know laugh about things every night but that it seems to becoming increasingly difficult lately it feels like someone has opened up a window into hell and what I'm talking about tonight isn't about gun control it's about common sense common sense is no good will ever come from allowing a person to have weapons that can take down 527 Americans at a concert okay pause it right there I know something good that can come from those people having weapons have at the cops we broke down the door so this guy killed himself they all had these kinds of weapons all of them so clearly some people should have these weapons it's just not you right that's what Kimmel is saying and he goes on and we don't have to do the rest of it but basically he suggests in the transcript he says the NRA fought to make sure the people on the no-fly list can buy guns again Teddy Kennedy was on the no-fly list the problem with no-fly no-buy is that the no-fly list was too broad and again there is something called due process of law in the United States he says that no American citizen needs an m16 or ten of them okay military-grade weaponry is largely illegal for private citizens to own in the United States we're talking about something with automatic capacity machine guns have been banned in the United States since 1986 any machine gun made after 1986 used illegal for you to own under federal law and then he says you should write your congressperson and you should do something and then he says he thinks it's important and he finishes by saying you know I think it's important okay well guess what we all think it's important we all think it's important but you are not an expert just because you feel deeply you feeling deeply does not make you an expert on a topic it does not give you the background expertise it does not give you the statistical expertise to talk about this stuff even people who study this stuff makes statistical mistakes I made one earlier today when I've tweeted something out and corrected it the fact is Jimmy Kimmel doesn't even bother at that kind of research and the media are cheering him why because all that matters is the feelings we can't have a healthy body politic like this we cannot we cannot have a healthy body politic when the suggestion is that people on the other side just don't give a crap about their fellow Americans being shot and murdered in cold blood they're just being paid off by the NRA that's a recipe for people out on the streets hitting each other with clubs that really is this is a disaster area substituting ammo and emotional accusations for discourse that is reasoned an evidence-based is a huge mistake Jimmy Kimmel should not be cheered for what he did last night Jimmy Kimmel should be asked to provide the evidence for his sub positions rather than the evidence for his emotions again I believe he's sincere sincerity does not make what you're saying smart
