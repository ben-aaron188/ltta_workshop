special deal alright so Elizabeth Warren making my day great again so Elizabeth Warren is the senator from Massachusetts I knew her a little bit when I was at Harvard Law School because she was a property professor they're pretty popular property professor the first time I met her she literally the first time I met her she was recruiting for Harvard Law School and she ripped on Rush Limbaugh so that was a pretty good opener for what Elizabeth Warren was politically well Elizabeth Warren today decided that she would engage in the most humiliating cell phone I have ever seen in American politics I mean this is like the best self owned of all time this is the equivalent of that guy who owned gold during the World Cup and then got killed for it hopefully nothing bad happens to Elizabeth Warren nobody is calling for violence but this is a really bad own-goal my goodness so we have to travel back in time to a time when Elizabeth Warren claims that she was in fact a Native American she said that she had high Cherokee cheekbones she suggested in a in a recipe book called powwow Chow I kid you not that she was a Native American and the recipe she submitted to powwow Chow was a recipe again I kid you not for a crab bisque because clearly that was something the Cherokees made back in the day crab bisque he noted crab herds of the Oklahoma Plains that her ancestors used to hunt elude with Morin told this story over and over about her Native American ancestry and what she said was that their racist members of her family couldn't accept her parents romance because her mom was partially Native American here's Hill Elizabeth Warren telling the romantic story actually you haven't wrong about what it is I believe let's start there okay my mom and dad were very much in love with each other and they wanted to get married and my father's parents said absolutely not you can't marry her because she's part Cherokee and she's part Delaware and um after fighting it as long as they could my parents went off they eloped okay so her parents eloped because her mom was part Cherokee and part Delaware which means you would think pretty hefty dose of Native American ancestry right there right I mean if if her family is worried about it then sounds like that would be some significant Native American ancestry so President Trump didn't believe this because it's nonsense they had people actually checked into her background they found there's no Native American ancestry anywhere in the in the time horizon of rationality so President Trump went out on the campaign trail this is back in 2017 I believe and he was holding a rally in Montana and he suggested that he would give her a million dollars if she could prove her native-american ancestry and we will say I will give you a million dollars to your favorite charity paid for by Trump if you take the test that it shows you're an idiot you know so today Elizabeth Warren came forward with the evidence that she was in fact Native American now I think that it is important to note if you don't believe in media bias you have to check out the headlines today because the headlines today are truly astonishing the headline today The Daily Beast suggests that there is strong evidence that she is Native American okay this it says this is the actual title Elizabeth Warren DNA test reveals Native American ancestry her claims to indigenous heritage had been ridiculed by Trump CNN had a headline about Elizabeth Warren same thing says Trump offered 1 million dollars now he says who cares an Elizabeth Warren releases tests with strong evidence of ancestry and then analysis why Elizabeth Warren is number one in our new 20/20 ranking so CNN obviously has a pretty strong agenda here so what this would suggest if you just read those headlines is she took a DNA test and it found that a great grandparent was Native American or something well not much so she took a DNA test and here's what each other's according to Boston Globe the analysis of Warren's DNA was done by Carlos Bustamante a Stanford University professor and expert in the field who won a 2010 McArthur fellowship also known as a genius grant for his work on tracking population migration via DNA analysis he concluded that the vast majority of Lauren's ancestry is European but he added that the results strongly support the existence of an unadorned it means Bustamante calculated that Warren's pure Native American ancestor appears in her family tree in the range of 6 to 10 generations ago six to ten generations ago in other words her actual Native American ancestor could be Pocahontas now it takes you back like 200 years that's it just just to be straight about this her claim that she has Native American ancestry was that her parent her mom was so Native American that she was discriminated against by her dad's family that is not the same thing as her great-great-great great-great grandparent minimum was a Native American not not the same thing at all and by the way that is not the outer limit of the test the test shows that at best at best she was a sixth generation Native American at worst at worst its tenth which would mean that she had an ancestor her great-great-great great-great-great great-great-great grandparent who is Native American okay the best part of this Boston Globe's story it's really really spectacular so it says the inherence imprecision of the six page DNA analysis could provide fodder for morons critics yeah I think if for a great-great-great grandmother was a Native American that puts her at 1/32 American Indian but no one says she's 1/32 the minimum writing the minimum is that she is one I think it was one 512 or something she's not that like one thirty seconds is not actually a a sixth generation Native American that's that's like a fourth generation Native American in any case the report includes the possibility that she is just one 1,024 Native American if the ancestor is ten generations back one 1024 I love this so here here's the even better part to make up for the dearth of Native American ancestry DNA Bustamante used samples from Mexico Peru and Colombia to stand in for Native American so notice he knew when you use like Cherokee DNA to match her up he used Mexican Peruvian and Colombian DNA to match up so what it really shows is that she's won 1,024 Mexican Peruvian or Colombian so awesome awesome I love this it says Warren has 12 times more Native American blood than a white person from Great Britain and 10 times more than a white person from Utah the report found well there's only one problem with that what the actual study shows that the average American in the United States of any race the average American in the United States is 0.18 percent is 0.18 percent Native American may that is what and by the way you're not accepted as a Native American a Native American tribe enlist or at least 1/16 Native American meaning you had a great grandparent who is Native American so we are now going back 10 generations to try and claim that she's a Native American because she claimed I guess a University of Pennsylvania Native American heritage and all the rest he is point zero zero nine percent Native American and she's bragging about this right this is her claim and the media are saying well they should put this thing to bed this should put it to bed that is not that is not what she said that's not what she said at all at all it's spectacular she's 99.999% white Matt Walsh is a good tweet about this after finding out that Warren is a staggering 99.999% white Richard Spencer is expected to endorse her for president oh I love it so much I love it so much so by the way according to science just want to get this straight according to science if you are one 1,024 Native American that is strong evidence of Native American ancestry if you have two x-chromosomes this doesn't mean you're a woman that's according to the media this is science people this isn't politics its science so I have suggested publicly as others have done I'm not the only one or person to have suggested this president Trump should not give 1 million dollars to Elizabeth Warren he should give her one one thousand 24th of a million dollars he should sign her a $900 check because that's how Native American she is it's so good and he should put it he should print it out any giant Publishers Clearing House check and he should sign it to Elizabeth Warren and in the subject line destroyed failing 2020 campaign it's just spectacular it's just spectacular so I love it and again you have to love the media bias here if anybody claimed this on the right are you kidding me if I claimed that I had Native American ancestry and then people look well Ben you're pretty Jewish yeah well you know if I take a 23andme test and it shows that ten generations ago maybe someone with some DNA in common with a Colombian person was in my ancestry would that make you Native American also I do love this yeah the the again the idea that she is Native American based on an ancestor ten generations ago that's insane there's not even the greatest racists like the greatest racists on earth would not call her Native American the people who hate Native Americans would not call her Native American based on that ancestry no Nazis not real fond of Jews they cut off Jewish ancestry at second generation at third generation they said if you have four German grandparents then you are considered fully German okay and those people were super giant racists so the left is now even more racist than the biggest racist because they are saying that if you have one tiny drop of Native American ancestry from 400 years ago now your Native American what are Native Americans feel about this it can't be great it can't be great really really astonishing so it's so good we'll have more on this I love it so I love it so ah it's so great I have more on this in just one second - first let's talk about the air that you are breathing so there's a new study it just came out of China and it discovered that air pollution causes a huge reduction in intelligence which might explain our nation's politics right now high pollution levels lluvia it led to significant drops in test scores with language and arithmetic the average impact equivalence having lost an entire year of Education well now we know what happened to all the people who protest me when I go to college campuses but it is important for you to have clean air in your home with ninety five percent of the global population breathing unsafe air you ought to have filters in your house that work filter by comm is America's leading provider of HVAC filters for homes and small businesses you can choose from over 600 sizes including custom options that chip free within 24 hours plus they support working Americans manufacturing all their filters right here in America save 5% when you subscribe for auto replacement so you will never forget to change your filters ever again filter by will save you time money you're gonna breathe better apparently you become more intelligence in the process which is awesome for you so stop procrastinating go to filter Bui calm that's filter by comm tell them that we sent you we use filter by here in the office I've used it at my house as well go check it out right now filter bu why calm that's filter by calm so spectacular so Elizabeth Warren just making a mockery of herself and not even knowing it in the media playing along now the question is what motivated her to do this right what what made her do this what made Elizabeth Warren think this is a great idea the answer is and what Manor think by the way how the hell great idea that you'd think this was she went home and she filmed a video with a bunch of her family members complaining about how Trump was mean for suggesting she didn't have a Native American ancestry uh-huh she obviously is prepping for a presidential run but this is so my you know how you know wait Elizabeth Warren is look at the back of this paper okay this paper right here is less white than than Elizabeth Warren is because you can still see the ink through it a little bit okay loser with Warren is more white than this piece of paper and yet she is proclaiming I just made am American it's so good it's just it's so good okay so I love it but why did she do this she did this because she knew the media would cover for anyway so the so the the media wrote a bunch of headlines saying that now she had been now she had been justified she had been justified in her accusations she had been justified in her claims and she is calling on President Trump to sign her a million dollar check because she is possibly point zero nine percent Native American solid solid stuff there but she's right because the media do back her play no matter what she does the media will back her play and that's obvious from the weekend's media coverage the media you know it's funny folks on the Left suggest that the people on the right are better cleaners we cling to God and we cling to guns and we cling to and we cling to our American status we cling to our borders I mean clinging to our language we cling to all sorts of terrible things remember Barack Obama blamed evil republicanism on being bitter clingers Elizabeth Warren is bitterly clinging on to the sanera t'v in the media are bitterly clinging on along with her and then they are clinging on to a bunch of other false narratives that they are putting out now all they have to do I've said this on CNN all that the media have to do in order to undermine President Trump is just try to stick to the truth they can't do it there's nothing that they can do that that will force them to stick the truth and I have the evidence of this so over the weekend there are two separate two separate major media stories that turned out to be basically false about President Trump Story number one here is 8:00 in NBC tweet about a rally the President Trump did I believe Friday night it says watch president Trump says robert e lee was a great general during ohio rally calling the Confederate leader incredible now you think well that's bad stuff you probably shouldn't call a Confederate leader incredible it is true by the way that robert e lee was a good general Eiling rage chatter nobody was a good general that doesn't mean that he was a good person or that he believed good things but that was the headline from UC News the headline from NBC News is that Trump said that Robert Ely was a great general and called the Confederate leader incredible now here is what President Trump actually said about robbery Lee here's the clip of President Trump talking and one day it was looking really bad and Lincoln just said you hardly knew his name and they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem and Lincoln said I don't care what problem he has you guys aren't winning and his name was Grant General Grant and Lincoln said I don't care if he's an alcoholic frankly give me six or seven more just like him okay so there is Trump actually talking about Brent what he was saying is that robert e lee was a great general who has overcome by grant he was not saying that robert ii lose a wonderful wonderful person standing for wonderful things so NBC has to actually correct it so Trump tweets this out he says you guys got this wrong he got this wrong so here's president Trump's tweet NBC News has totally and purposely changed the put and meaning of my story about general robert e lee and General Ulysses Grant was actually a shout out to warrior grant and the great state in which he was born as usual dishonest reporting even mainstream media embarrassed an NBC he had to suite out a correction they tweeted out a full correction correction an earlier tweet misidentified the general president Trump described as incredible at a rally in Ohio it was general ulysses s grant not general robert e lee an attached video clip lacked the full context for trump's remark here is the full clip it took NBC News two full days to retract it two full days and that wasn't the only example of ridiculous media bias in the last 48 hours so CBS tweeted this out about President Trump on 60 minutes so last night President Trump was on 60 minutes here's what they tweeted they tweeted President Trump on his treatment of Christine Blasi Ford at rally the accuser of Jos now Justice Brett Kavanaugh it doesn't matter we won makes it sound like question was do you care that you mocked Christine Blasi Ford and Trump says it doesn't matter we won well there's only one problem that is clearly not what Trump was saying like clearly not what Trump was saying here is president Trump actually talking we need the actual clip of President Trump talking from from 60 minutes and here he is here he is in context that is absolutely not what he saying professor Blasi Ford you mimicked her had I not made that speech we would not have won I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything no and you tried to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary why did you have to make fun of her I didn't really make fun well they were like I said is the person that we're talking about didn't know the year the time the place professor quasi Ford got before the Senate and and was asked what's the worst moment she said when the two boys laughed at me at my expense and then I watched you mimic her and thousands of people were laughing at her they can do what they I will tell you the way now justice Cavanaugh was traded has become a big factor in the midterms have you seen what's gone on with the polls what did you have - well I think she was treated with great respect nobody honest like what do you think you should do you think you treated her with great residue so yeah I did but you seem to be saying that she lied what you know what I'm not gonna get into it because we won it doesn't matter we won okay so clearly he's not saying I don't care that you're accusing me of mocking her because we won he is saying I'm not gonna get into this with you it's over we're done the media covered this as though he was saying that he didn't care that he had mocked her which is actually not what he said so they took that out of context - it's just amazing it's just amazing so again when President Trump slams the so-called fake news when they actually are participating in fake news they absolutely 100% deserve it they absolutely 100% deserve all of it in a second we're gonna go through an epic episode of some good Trump bad Trump because President Trump was on 60 minutes yesterday but first let's talk about how you are going to relax does this new cycle make you want to relax do you need to relax a little bit I mean I know your poem was from laughter over Elizabeth Warren's claim that she's

have to say this final note on this Elizabeth Warren thing the the left is now trying to Gaslight so they say Elizabeth Warren says that she is Native American and then we go home no she's not and then she says okay well here's the DNA test proving that I am pretty much not Native American I would go right because we said she wasn't they said no no no we said pretty much not ten generations ago she had a Native American ancestor and we're like right but that's not really Native American like well you must be a racist because you don't think that she's Native American based on an ancestor ten generations ago with Colombian DNA okay you don't get to do that and Elizabeth Warren is is obviously kicking into height roll height roll mode so she actually tweeted out this morning that President Trump is that President Trump has apparently forgotten about his promises to pay her money it says having some memory problems mr. Trump should we call for a doctor here's something you won't forget mr. president the least popular president in modern history and your allies will go down hard in the midterm elections 22 days tick tock tick tock so basically Michael a Vinod he just took over Elizabeth Warren's sweater feed good luck with with all of this for the Democrats now with all that said President Trump was on 60 minutes last night he did overall I think a pretty good job because he was dealing with an interviewer in Lesley Stahl who is wildly anti Trump really really hates Trump and you can tell from the questions but it was a pretty that's a pretty epic episode of good Trump bad Trump so I have been the progenitor like the actual creator not ten generations ago the actual creator of good trump bad Trump yeah this model that says sometimes the president says good things and sometimes the president says bad things and we have a theme song for we haven't played it in a while but today seemed a nap today so let's play a little good Trump and Trump okay so on the good Trump side I have to acknowledge that the President did quote tweet me this morning which was kind of fun so he watched my final Sunday special on Fox News and he tweeted out the only way to shut down the Democrats new mob rules strategy is to stop them called at the ballot box the fight for America's future is never over Ben Shapiro Thank You mr. president I appreciate it so that's good Trump other a good Trump he said something he said some interesting things on 60 minutes and when he talked about the Democrats not wanting the country to heal this obviously was criterias President Trump going after the Democrats he is not wrong about this considering that Elizabeth Warren today is doing the everybody hates you mr. Trump and my Native American ancestry is real and Hillary saying no civility for Republicans and all the rest here is president from talking about Democrats wanting to divide the country we need to be healed we need I don't think they want to heal yet I'll be home yeah I saw Hillary Clinton made a really nasty statement I don't think they want to be healed I do want to heal okay so I agree that the Democrats don't want the country to heal I'm not sure that President Trump is the most healing president but we will count this in the category of good Trump in the category of bad Trump here was president from talking about Saudi Arabia so he has made a couple of comments what he said on 60 minutes was not bad but Saudi Arabia is enmeshed in a massive scandal right now because there's this guy named Jamal khashoggi and Jamal cushaw he was a person who wrote op eds for the Washington Post he was a longtime retainer of the Saudi royal family and a critic of the regime he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Turkey on October 2nd seeking documents relevant to a divorce the Turkish government claims that they have proof that a Saudi hit squad murdered him inside the consulate chops his body up and then dispatched the remains in a black van to a private plane headed for Saudi Arabia there's not a lot of doubt that kesaji is dead at this point this is creating worldwide consternation against the Saudi government and in particular against Prince Mohammed bin Sultan who's considered the new leader of Saudi Arabia the new dictator of Saudi Arabia a few comments are necessary on this to understand what's going on exactly number one Saudi Arabia is a tyrannical dictatorship led by people who are tyrannical dictators it's a monarchy they chop people's hands off they imprison dissidents they're not a human rights friendly country Muhammad bin Sultan was supposed to be a reformer but even as a reformer he's still the dictator of Saudi Arabia this is not a supremely shocking story on any level other than we know the name of the guy who has disappeared as opposed to presumably many other people whose names we don't know who have been disappeared second the Turkish government has a pretty strong interest in trying to humiliate the Saudis because the Turkish government has basically been anti Saudi for years that are in bed with the Iranian government at this point and to a certain extent in bed with the Syrian government as well all of that said the Turkish government releasing evidence in an attempt to make it look like they are our friends air Dewan who's a leader of Turkey also in Islamist thug who has imprisoned dissidents and killed dissidents - so there are no good guys in this part of the world at least not in leadership positions in any case the call for the United States to distance itself from the Saudi Arabian government after all of this I think is appropriate but I think it's also appropriate to note that the outsized consternation with regard to Khashoggi which when I say outsized I don't mean that it's inappropriate it's totally appropriate but when compared to the amount of consternation over turkey imprisoning thousands of people and until a minute ago imprisoning a US pastor or Syria murdering half a million people or Iran pursuing terrorism across the region it's it is amazing how the human brain has the capacity to hone in on a single incidence of evil in a way that it doesn't on literally hundreds of thousands of incidents of evil but with all of that said the United States does have to do something if the Saudi Arabian government is calling dissonance back to consulates and then murdering them that's not a that is that is a bad thing here's President Trump on 60 minutes talking about it he changed his tune a little bit today they are honoring military equipment everybody in the world wanted that order Russia wanted it China wanted it we wanted it we got it so would you cut that off no I don't know what I don't want to do Boeing Lockheed Raytheon all these cuts I don't want to hurt jobs I don't want to lose an order like that there are other ways of to use a word that's a pretty harsh word but there's true okay so you know when he says that he wants to maintain certain economic ties that's not great Trump right he needs to actually be exerting pressure on the Saudis for reform now he has to do that carefully because he also doesn't want to give a lot of leeway and leverage to the Iranians who are enemies with the Saudi regime and have been fighting a proxy war in Yemen with the Saudis like there again there are no good guys in this particular area of the world but with that said yeah the president ought to be signaling some pretty harsh rhetoric with regard to the kesaji situation he is not so that one files under bad Trump today he said that the Saudi Arabian government denies it they say that it's not real so we're just going to ignore it that is not great stuff from the president okay other stuff that the president said during the 60 Minutes interview here is some other bad Trump here's President Trump i'm kim jong hoon the the dictator another evil dictator and he had some more morons for him why do you love that guy look look I get along with him okay him okay that's just like you know it's like an embrace well let it be at a bris let it be whatever it is he's a Chad guy look let it be whatever it is I get along with him really well I have a good energy with him have a good chemistry with him look at the horrible threats that were made no more threats no more threats okay so you know him him talking about Kim that way is not good either you actually have to demonstrate a strong hand and president Trump did that early in his presidency with him but he's not really doing that anymore so there's a lot of good Trump bad frump happening with with regard to 60 minutes but that's who the president is and it is important to note that his ups and downs are indicative of the man's mind I mean that's just to present in Trump it is so in just a second I want to get to the other big story of the weekend which was these violent clashes

Hillary there is no such thing as good Hillary so Hillary came out over the weekend and said that Bill Clinton should not have resigned over Monica Lewinsky because he did not abuse his power in any way I do love that she is considered a hero a heroine of the feminist movement pretty spectacular stuff from the left here here as Hillary MIT Clinton in retrospect do you think Bill should have resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scan not it wasn't an abuse of power no no there are people who look at the incidents of the 90s and they say a president of the United States cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalances too was an adult but let me ask you this where's the investigation of the current incumbent against whom numerous allegations have been made so good so good so I love this Trump should resign because of allegations against him but her husband shouldn't resign because of allegations against him also he didn't abuse power one he 49 year old president of the United States was being serviced by a 22 year old intern in the Oval Office not an abuse of power in any way good to know that power imbalance is no longer a concern for feminists on the left very exciting stuff also Hillary came forth and said President Trump is a sexist of course the reason that she knows Trump is a sexist is because Trump was mean to her if you watched the way Trump debated me it was just imbued with sexism making fun of me for preparing well you know that's the old like oh yeah the girl in the class who's always prepared I don't need to be prepared that really was now it happened at those debates what happened is the Trump was as much of a jerk to her as he is to every other human being on the planet and it didn't play well with her because she's one of the most deeply unlikable human beings on planet Earth just loved it the Democrats have decided to full-scale embrace the most radical version of themselves you know they say in acting that you have to get in touch with your authenticity the Democrats are certainly getting in touch with their authenticity the problem is that deep down Democratic leadership not particularly charming Bernie Sanders is another example of this so Bernie was on Jake Tapper's show on CNN and Jay tapper asked him about the inflammatory rhetoric on the part of some folks in the Democratic Party and Bernie a follower of who's shot up a bunch of Congress people last year came out and said that it's not that bad if people get mobbed in public places like it's amazing that Bernie doesn't feel any necessity to say anything here about this sort of action you know I listen again I don't blame Bernie Sanders for that incident last year because unless you are openly calling for violence I don't blame you for somebody going and doing violence but when Bernie Sanders refuses to condemn mobbing in public spaces he certainly is not making the country a better place I am very strongly in favor of mobilizing the American people to stand up and fight for economic justice and social justice and racial and environmental justice and I think we have to mobilize people I am NOT a great fan of being rude or disrupting activities but this is what I will say this entire 2000 and election campaign is gonna come down to two words and that is voter turn up okay so he's not a big fan of people getting over but if people get rude that's sort of the way that it is and voter turnout don't want to dampen the enthusiasm it just shows how the Democrats are willing to flirt with the mob politics they've been talking about for the last several months really since Maxine Waters broke out into the open with it and they're willing to do so on a regular basis they're even willing to validate mob violence on a regular basis over the weekend The Washington Times reported that Portland mayor Ted wheeler came under fire over a viral video showing an Tifa protesters blocking traffic and harassing drivers but he says he supports the decision by police to watch from a distance without getting involved he says I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the Portland Police Bureau's decision not to intervene the whole incident will be investigated the video was posted by journalists and zine ago and it showed protesters including members of an Tifa and black lives matter blocking an intersection and attempting to direct traffic while officers on motorcycle watched from a block away at one point the activists chase down 74 year-old Kent Hauser after he made a right turn against their wishes pounding on his silver Lexus and breaking a window the car sustained thousands of dollars in damage he told The Oregonian but mr. wheeler insists the motorist should feel completely safe coming into downtown Portland well all of this this lack of law enforcement this lack of crackdowns on an Tifa it leads to greater heights of violence when other people who are ready for violence show up in places where an Tifa is now here has been my recommendation for a very long time I speak at a lot of public events where protesters show up and some of those events protesters get violent but I mean that that's happened at Cal State Los Angeles had happened at Penn State a little bit it happened certainly at Berkeley where nine people were arrested my recommendation has always been because there been people who said well should I come ready for self-defense I've always said is look if somebody hits you then defending yourself is fine but you should come ready to invoke the powers of the police you should be ready to go to the police and let law enforcement take care of the problem we live in a volatile climate enough that you don't have to go around spoiling for a fight because if you spoil for a fight the media is just gonna play it as though you're the instigator of the fight in the first place the reason I bring this up is because over the weekend there are a couple of violent incidents one in New York and one in Portland and it's just not good stuff it's not good stuff I'll explain so first Portland so there was a March called the Patriot Patriot Pride I believe and it happened in Portland over the weekend and it was and it got ugly because aunt Eva showed up and people basically started beating the crap out of each other here's a little bit of the brawl so if you can't see this you can see people fighting with each other like really swinging on each other according to the Oregon live a demonstration billed as a March for law and order in the streets of Portland descend into chaos as rival political factions broke into bloody brawls downtown Saturday night members of the right-wing group patriot player and their black the black clad adversaries known as an tyfa used bear spray bare fists and batons to thrash each other outside Kelly's Olympian a popular bar on Southwest Washington Street the melee which lasted more than a minute ended when riot cops rushed in and fired pepper balls at the street fighters now as I say what's happening here is that groups like patriot prayer which I are being cast as white nationalist and I'm not seeing the strong enough evidence to say that this is a white nationalist group in any case and this is coming from a guy who's happy to say when I think people are white nationalists right I did two episodes after Charlottesville talking about white nationalism and the evils of the alt-right Patriot parrot was doing a march in Portland specifically because they wanted to show that antique food was violent and Tifa showed up and it looked like an Tifa instigated violence and the folks at patriot prayer then got into it with them including some of the proud boys from gavin mcginnises group and it got violent now as I say I think that is perfectly worthwhile to publicly march against violence and I think it's okay to defend yourself too but there's a difference between being willing to defend yourself and spoiling for a fight to the point where you are looking to beat the living crap out of somebody because number one you shouldn't be looking to beat the living crap out of people in aggressive fashion like once the guys down the guys down now it's time for law enforcement to come in and number two it is perfectly obvious that the media are going to play this as though it is right-wing groups instigating violence as opposed to ante foe which has been violent every single place it goes instigating violence here's a little bit more video from that brawl in Portland it's a little hard to see if you can see folks are marching and then it's about to break down into violence and see in the front people hitting each other or swinging on each other people shouting at each other okay and then there was also a separate brawl in New York so in New York there was a event at the New York Metropolitan Club that Club had been - faced by allegedly antiva over the past couple of days and there was an event for Gavin McInnes he's the leader of the proud boys now again the media have labeled the proud boys a white nationalist group they're members of the proud boys who are white nationalists Gavin is not a white nationalist I know Gavin Gavin is not a white nationalist Gavin I think needs to be more strict about who he involves as his friends but to suggest that Gavin is a white nationalist ignores any part of his rhetoric that that's just not accurate now with that said do the proud boys spoil for a fight yeah they do and you can see that in this particular video in New York now an tifa's claiming that the proud boys instigated the violence the proud boys are claiming that any fight instigated the violence apparently after the event they walked out there's some Antipa members somehow the violence gets instigated and you end up with basically 20 members of the proud boys kicking the living crap out of three members of an tyfa and then they won't get off these guys they're picking them and then eventually you'll see some members is sort of the surrounding crowd actually pulling people off of these guys because they don't want them you know getting arrested or killing somebody on the street brawls fought in public streets this is not civilization it's not civilization and if the police won't do their jobs this is gonna get worse and worse and if mayor's aren't gonna do their jobs it's gonna get worse and worse New York Governor Andrew Cuomo called on the FBI to investigate violent clashes connected to the proud boys and he blamed President Trump for the hatred and violence he tied to the altercations this is a state issue this is not a federal issue hey the state and city should investigate every one of these incidents and the people who instigate violence should go to jail if the city was doing that in the first place these brawls would not be breaking out we've seen them now in Sacramento we've seen them a couple of times in Portland we've seen them in Berkeley we have seen them now in New York City this is all ugly stuff yes be ready to defend yourself don't go to events though spoiling for a fight be there in coordination with the police if you're on the side of law enforcement you're doing something right and if the left refuses to allow law enforcement to do its job this sort of stuff is going to become more and more prevalent and it's horrible for the country truly truly awful for the country okay time for a couple of things that I like so things that I like today I was reading a couple of books over the weekend the first was from a guy named Greg Connolly so I went and visited Graceland and I realized I didn't know very much about Elvis so I did what I always do I went and I got a book on it so there's a really good book called being Elvis a lonely life by Ray Connolly and the book is fun and well-written and interesting if you're a fan of Elvis's music then it's a kick so go check that out ray Connolly's being Elvis a lonely life really it's an enjoyable read and I've been getting a kick out of it as well Elvis is music he's really he's got an underrated voice Elvis and the more you listen to him the more you realized that I was actually could sing particularly his ballads Love Me Tender is a really well song song and the funny thing about Love Me Tender write which he made really popular is that it is a 100 year old Confederate ballot I believe from like the 1860s 1850s 1860s reads on rearranged for a movie that he made his first movie in any case you can go check that out okay other things that I like this week so Michael Savage who's a radio talk show host and I disagree with Michael on a lot of things if you want a window in to sort of the Trump movement you know the folks on the left want a window into the Trump movement they ought to check out Michael's books because Michael has been preaching a lot of the same sort of themes some of which I agree with some which I disagree with that Trump has been on for a long time there's a reason that Trump and Savage were close during the last election cycle E is a new book out called stop mass hysteria America's insanity from the Salem witch trials to the Trump witch hunts about the left targeting Trump you know the left acts like they don't have a window into the mind of Trump people like the Trump people are all crazy and that they don't have anybody articulating their viewpoint savage is a pretty good articulator of that viewpoint so if folks want to know what a lot of the Trump base is thinking Michael has a good bead on it go check out stop mass hysteria that's that's Michael's new book again don't agree with everything in the book but I like windows into into ideas and Michael provides that for sure okay other things that I like so bill maher gets some credit today he was on his show and this is what I wish we had talked about when Maher had me on was the was the evils of political correctness instead he wanted to talk Russia for some odd reason but here's Bill Maher talking about liberals trying to crack down on people quoting churchill and how insane all of this is 80% in this new atlantic story that published this poll 80% of americans see political correctness as a problem and I think it's our problem and I don't know why more mainstream liberals don't denounce the political correctness that they must know in private conversations is insane okay and he's exactly right about all of this of course a good for Bill Maher well you credit when it is due around here okay time for a couple of things that I hate so Israel has taken a policy that I think is very very foolish there's a policy where basically Israel has barred unhinged people from traveling to study in Israel so there's this woman who's named is Lara al-qasim she's 22 she's an American student of Palestinian descent she arrived in Israel within Israeli issued visa to study in a master's program at Hebrew you she never made it out of the airport Israeli security officials detained her because of her past membership in students for justice in Palestine which is indeed an anti-semitic anti-israel group they support BDS a boycott divestment and sanctions policy toward the Jewish state now she is facing a deportation here this is bad politics and it is anti First Amendment principles now my view is this the State of Israel does not have to give citizenship to anybody who wants to undermine the State of Israel just as the United States does not have to give citizenship to anybody who wants to undermine the the United States of America as the general rule bringing in people to study in your country as long as they are paying their own way and it's not taking public - I was like I don't think we should be subsidizing that in the United States but if somebody comes here and they are a socialist for example and they want to study in an engineering program here and they want to pay their own way I don't see a big problem with that and I think that it would be a mistake for the United States to bar people based on political viewpoints except when it comes to actually becoming citizens and integrating into the society so Israel has no need to grant citizenship to this woman al-qassam they've been doing this for a few months and I don't think it's smart in april catherine frank is Barry Weiss and Bret Stevens reporting at the New York Times a professor at Columbia was inter it was interrogated and then deported from Israel on charges of being a leader of Jewish Voice for Peace which is another organization that endorses BDS in August Simone Zimmerman an American Jewish activist who lives in Israel and as a founder if not now which is a group that is also Pro BDS was held at the Israeli border for more than three hours and quizzed on her political views Peter Bernard who is an absolute schmuck of a human being but he is a he's a left-wing Zionist supposedly he's also quasi Pro BDS he was on his way to his niece's Bat Mitzvah in Israel and he was detained in question this is foolish for people who are just visiting if you think they're a national security threat like a real security threat like they're raising money against Israel then then you have every right to be on them but if they're just there and they're left-wing let them in make it you know have them leave on their visa expires and that's that this is this is bad policy I feel the same way about Israel as I do about the United States on free speech basis this seems counterproductive and foolish I agree with Brett and Barry when they say Israel like all countries has a right to protect its borders and to determine who is allowed in and out but Israel is also a state that prides itself on being a liberal democracy a fact that goes far to explain the long-standing support for Israel among American Jews and non-jews alike if liberalism is about anything it's about deep tolerance for opinions we find foolish dangerous and antithetical to our own so detaining folks is is not a worthwhile goal I think this is right but you don't have to give citizenship to anybody nor do you have to give public benefits to anybody and that's where I would draw the line where I Israel I feel the exact same way about the United States okay other things that I hate so speaking of media bias the insane piece in the new york times over the weekend talking about Jared Kushner and his taxes so ever since nikki Haley suggested that Jared Kushner is a smart guy the media have decided that they are on the warpath for Kushner they have two separate lines of attack over the past several days why don't we tag number one Jared Kushner is close with MBS Muhammad bin Sultan the Saudi prince responsible allegedly for the murder of Jamal khashoggi who is that Saudi dissident so Jared is close with the Saudi government therefore it's Jared's fault the Saudi government did something bad I'd like to see that logic applied to every American president for the last 60 years I'd like to see that logic apply because that logic simply does not hold if anybody has an alternative in Saudi Arabia we can get behind I am happy to hear it otherwise Jared question are working with Mohammed bin Sultan before he knew about a murder seems to me not a terrible idea considering that Mohammed it's worth noting here that Mohammed bin Sultan has been militantly opposed to the Muslim Brotherhood and also opposed to the Iranians meaning we have global interests in the Saudi government we have actual interest in the Saudi government that doesn't mean that we can't snap them when they do something wrong as we should but to blame Jared Kushner for this is just ridiculous and silly the other line of attack that Jared didn't pay his taxes so according to the New York Times over the past decade Jared Kushner's family company has spent billions of dollars buying real estate his personal stock investments have soared his net worth has quintupled to almost 324 million dollars and yet for several years running mr. Kushner appears to have paid almost no federal income taxes according to confidential financial documents reviewed by the New York Times his low tax bills are the results of a common tax minimizing maneuver that year-after-year generated millions of dollars in losses for mr. Kushner but the losses were only on paper because his company didn't actually appear to lose money the losses were driven by depreciation which is a tax benefit that lets real estate investors deduct a portion of the cost of their buildings from their taxable income every year in 2015 for example Kushner took home 1.7 million dollars in salary and investment gains but those earnings were swamped by 8.3 million dollars of losses largely because of against appreciation Kushner his company took on their real estate so here's the question did he break the law here's the New York Times nothing in the document suggest mr. Kushner or his company broke the law so why is this an article so the article is Jared Kushner paid his taxes but he didn't actually owe taxes so he didn't pay taxes how exactly is that an attack you know the this it just it's cynical I mean really that cynical stuff you don't like the tax code argue against the tax code but don't blame people for abiding by the actual law of the land in the United States okay time for a quick Federalist paper and then we'll be out of here so we are all the way up to Federalists at 47 written by written by James Madison and this one is really fascinating because it talks about the original concept of separation of powers Madison says that tyranny is a failure of the separation of powers he says quote the accumulation of all powers legislative executive and judiciary in the same hands whether of one a few or many and whether hereditary self-appointed or elective may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny in other words if you have a branch that has irrigated to itself judicial power executive power and legislative power that would be a tyranny and he says that if the Constitution were really chargeable with the accumulation of that sort of power then no further arguments would be necessary to inspire a universal reprobation of the system he does say listen there are parts where the executive does legislative stuff and parts where the legislative does executive stuff and part two where the judiciary does legislative stuff but if they irrigate extensive and exclusive power of one of the other branches that is tyranny say quotes Montesquieu French philosopher Montesquieu who was the progenitor of this idea of checks and balances he says his meaning as his own words important and still more conclusively as illustrated by the example in his I can amount to no more than this that were the whole power of one department is exercised by the same hands which possessed the whole power of another Department the fundamental principles of a free Constitution are subvert 'add this would have been the case in the Constitution examined by him if the King was the sole executive magistrate had also possessed the complete legislative power or the supreme administration of justice Montesquieu objected to the merger of the executive and the legislative so here is a quote from Montesquieu when the legislative and executive powers are united in the same person or body there can be no Liberty because the apprehensions may arise lest the same monarch or Senate should enact tyrannical laws to execute them in a tyrannical manner he said one of the power of judging joined with the legislative the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control for the judge would then be the legislature we're joined to the executive power the judge might behave with all the violence of an oppressor so the argument right now in the United States is whether this is what's heck actually happened with the executive branch the executive branch basically legislates not basically they do the regulatory power of the executive branch is legislative power now you can argue that's not the whole legislative power because Congress can trump that a Congress has failed to trump that if you actually would like to see a check-and-balance again Congress has to take back some of that power Congress is doing some of that under President Trump they were involved in in a legislative move whether they basically were knocking down regulations at a pretty rapid rate that's good and necessary the executive power has also gained the judiciary power give administrative agencies with their own hearings boards this is one of the reasons why there's been a lot of focus on a case called chevron chevron is a supreme court case in which the Supreme Court suggested the judiciary has to grant administrative deference to administrative agencies so you have a case in front of the EPA you go to the EPA board the EPA Administrative Board gives you a judicial decision the question is whether the judiciary can trump that decision Chevron says in many cases no that's why Chevron is wrong it's why justice Gorsuch has opposed Chevron it's why justice Cavanaugh opposed to chevron chevron should be struck down just for these checks and balances to be restored irrigation of too much power in one branch is the essence of tyranny that remains as true today as when the Constitution was written okay we'll be back here tomorrow with all of the latest presumably including full stories of Elizabeth Warren's time with the Native American tribes writing the crab ridden plains of Oklahoma we'll have all of it for you tomorrow I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is
