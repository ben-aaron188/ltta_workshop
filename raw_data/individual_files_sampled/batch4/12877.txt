policy genius calm when it's this easy to compare life insurance why put it off professor height thanks so much for stopping by this is really a pleasure so I want to start off by asking you sort of some off-the-beaten-track questions about your background I like to find out where people are coming from before we delve into their ideas so what exactly is your you become very politicized a lot of folks in politics very interested in what you have to say your books were first recommended to me by a high-ranking Republican official what is your political background where do you stand politically and how did you get there well I'm a totally stereotypical Northeast Jewish liberal you know academic type that's my background I grew up hating well Richard Nixon my was a little kid because I knew what you're supposed to hate Nixon and then Reagan I began studying cultural psychology in graduate school looking at how nations vary in their morale in their in their moral worldviews and then as the when the Democrats lost in 2000 and then again in 2004 I began I was very upset and I said I can't stand it that the Democrats don't know how to talk about morality and I can help them and so I started converting my research over my research from how countries vary - how left and right very because by then left and right in this country were becoming like different countries with different US history and even you know different constitutions and so I committed to understanding conservatives that I could help explain conservative morality and in the course of reading conservative and libertarian philosophy and ideas I realized oh my god you actually have to look at problems from different perspectives to understand them over time I kind of stepped out I still talk about the Republican Party later I have very little good to say about the Republican Party but I no longer identify as being on any team I study moral psychology I'm a social scientist and I think as a social psychologist if you're doing social science it's really helpful to not be on a team to have the independence to just try to study problem so that's my background so as a precursor to discussing some of the issues you discuss in the coddling of the American mind I think it's almost necessary to talk about your earlier book the righteous mind because that sort of provides the intellectual framework for what you talk about in the new book so I wanted to ask you some questions about about where that so to fill in folks who may not have read the book you make an argument that there are a bunch of different moral axes along which people work that people don't just work along the idea of good and bad that this breaks down into a number of different categories and that left and right see these categories differently so what exactly are those moral axes and how do they play into politics yeah so from studying morality across cultures and reading you know the Old Testament and the Quran and reading ethnographies from non-western societies it was really clear that that everywhere you look people understand like you know harm and pain and suffering that that's a moral issue and reciprocity and fairness that's a moral issue everywhere but when you go to other issues like respect for authority it's very common but some places are really a gala terian and sort in-group loyalty that's very common but some places it's less important and then that's four axes are dimensions and then the fifth one is sanctity or purity the idea that's that the body is a temple it must be protected from from degradation so the kosher laws and Judaism are similar in some ways to the hindu restrictions on eating and prayer things like that so it's a the theory that i developed based in part on the ideas of richard shweder my advisor at the university of chicago was that the moral mind is like the way the tongue has five different taste buds on it for to pick up five different chemical properties of the world our minds it's as though they have five or more different moral taste buds and different religions different political philosophies build a structure on some of those what I found empirically from doing research survey work in other kinds of work is that people on the left in America and in general in other countries too they build their morality mostly on issues of care harm protection of the vulnerable and then fairness but fairness as a quality whereas social conservatives they have those but they see fairness more as proportionality do the crime do the time that sort of thing and then they also care a lot more about group loyalty respect for authority and a sense of sanctity or purity and if you have that vocabulary those five moral foundations you can understand why left and right can't understand each other on most cultural warrant issues and so what that what that sort of implies and it's underscored by the other point that you making the righteous mind which the people are largely driven by intuition rather than how we like to think of ourselves as reasonable creatures if that's the case can there ever really be any sort of conciliation in terms of politics or is all of this sort of chimeric all like there's no way to come to it to it is sort of even conversation right so so philosophically and psychologically I am an intuitionist that means I think intuition is where the action is into it more our moral intuitions come first and they drive our reasoning afterwards that might make it seem as though we therefore can't agree because we're all just driven by gut feelings but it's more complicated than that because our intuitions come first but they are educable they are changeable we can't change each other's intuitions just by throwing reasons you know if left and right talking to each other well you know don't you care about you know respect for your parents you can't just throw things at each other but in relationships we we come to listen to somebody we talk with someone our minds can meld this is an amazing ability that humans have that no other animal has we can meld our minds if we're open to that and then we can actually hear each other and that's what happened to me when I set out to understand conservative thought I actually met a few conservatives I'm there were not many in my world but I talked to some people they were very decent people so through relationships with the right kind of relationships we actually can open our minds and hearts a great novel can do that a great ethnography can do that and one of the tragedies are our national life is that while we used to be fairly mixed politically and we were more separated racially in other ways we've gotten more mixed along a lot of axes but we're getting more and more separate politically we live more in more and more purified filter bubbles and that makes it harder to empathize it exacerbates our political divide and it damages our democracy so that brings us to the new book the coddling of the American mind which really talks about the ramifications of exactly this sort of divide and in the in the coddling of the American mind you talk about what you'd consider three big problems in American society today if you want to just illuminate those that'd be fantastic sure so the book is based around three great untruths my first book the happiness hypothesis was actually about ten insights that you find in ancient cultures all over the world psychological insights and so one of them is what doesn't kill you makes you stronger that was Nietzsche's formulation but you find the exact same idea in mensches in ancient China you find it all over the world that kids need Challen beings need challenge obstacles failure setback in order to grow so that's a basic truth that's a psychological truth but what we're finding on campus we're finding in the lives of American kids is an increasing increasing presence of the idea that what doesn't kill you makes you weaker that is in fact oh my god there's just just recently there's an article making the rounds kids are mobilizing in high school to to end the practice of regular public speaking that we you know some kids have anxiety around public speaking that's very common one of the article one of the lines in this Atlantic article it quoted a high school kids saying nobody should be forced to do something that they're not comfortable doing Wow Wow can you imagine raising kids with that dictum how would they come out if this is true that we need challenges setbacks even fear we have to be afraid and overcome it and realize oh I can do that and if we give in to this idea that no one should be forced to do anything they're uncomfortable doing we are setting up the next generation for failure and that's exactly our subtitle how good intentions and bad ideas are setting up a generation for failure more briefly the second grade on truth is always trust your feelings and the third is life is a battle between good people and evil people and our contention of this in the book is that if we can successfully teach the young generation all three of these great untruths they're almost guaranteed to fail well let's talk about that that last one because the last Bransford seems to me the most dangerous one of all the attempts to favor feelings I think have a long subjective history and in some ways may tie into the the intuition is Amit you talked about earlier I mean David Hume suggesting that basically we are creatures of passion and then the reason sort of rides on top pretending but with that with all that said when it comes to the question of you know people seeing each other's good and evil do you think that's bringing more from one side of the Alvin then another do you how do you see that that chain of causality moving well let's hold off on the question of who's to blame or who is more guilty of this let's just start with the basic psychology here which is that human beings evolved for tribalism this is actually our great secret but you know chimpanzees hunting they have had that they have troops and they controlled territories so they're able to do this they're able to have battles between groups but humans are the Masters of this and while that might sound bad actually it enables us to cooperate it enables us to have a shared moral world so we are by nature tribal and that's what got us into civilization but modern liberal democracies are brilliant at turning that down to allow people to live more peacefully humans go very quickly to tribalism but we can also tone it down we're very good at trade we're curious about other groups as well and so modern society is one that finds ways to turn that down allow people to live near others who are different from them with no hostility no violence and we did a pretty good job of that in the 20th century and there was a huge wave towards democracy so we made a lot of progress in last few centuries overcoming tribalism and the problem is that it's so easy to turn it back on and a lot of what's happening in our politics between left and right that's been accelerating since the 1990s cross partisan hatred keeps going up and up since the 1980s or 90s and unfortunately now with certain forms of identity politics we're finding these these tensions between groups in the United States and I just read there's a new book out called the tribe something like that in Britain very much the same process is happening in the UK so this I find very alarming that our our society our politics social media are turning up our tribalism so what do you think that increased tribalism is coming from because my theory would would be that based on sort of Robert putnams believes in in diversity of ethnicity being less beneficial than for example solidarity with regard to opinion meaning that diversity is is great so long as we all share a common goal but as if we don't share a common goal than everything fractures pretty quickly that the the goal-oriented nature of the United States a common culture that we shared has basically disintegrated since the 1960s in some ways that's been for good on issues of sex and race for example but in some ways that's been quite bad in terms of traditional morality in my view the stuff that held the social fabric together it seems like that's what's been fraying most is the social fabric and what that's done is its thrust people back into the the tribalism that you're talking about what would you attribute the rise in tribalism to yeah so the way that I think about what's happened to our country is that in a large secular society there are a lot of forces blowing us apart and they're a lot pulling us together and if you go back to the mid to late 20th century everything was lined up to pull us together we'd had extraordinarily high rates of immigration in the late 19th and early 20th century that's when my grandparents came over from Russia and Poland there was a big wave of anti-immigrant backlash and in the 20s the gates were shot immigration went way down and as you say immigration has many good effects and many bad effects yet you have to look at it honestly and try to maximize the good so we had by the 70s and 80s we had very low rates of foreign-born there was a dominant culture it was the wasp culture David Brooks has written brilliantly about how the wasp setup a meritocracy within which Jews and Asians and other groups were able to succeed we had a common enemy still in the Soviet Union we had a functioning political culture in Washington where there's a lot of bipartisanship Oh in the media system there were three networks and so there was a more common common sources of news so all those things were lined up and this was the center of American greatness and all over the world people look to America and they said wow we want what they've got let's copy their Constitution let's copy their culture we were the light of the world obviously that's plenty of anti-americanism too but there's a lot of admiration for us and then one by one the the centrifugal force is pulling us together began to weaken the immediate environment obviously reversed beginning with cable TV all the way through to social media now it's fractionating us the obviously immigration greatly increased beginning of the 60s and again many good things The Economist's or clear integration is good economically but as you say the issues of social trust and cohesion Robert putnams work and others suggest that that that drops trust in others drops and to have a functioning democracy it really helps to have cross group trust to not be suspicious of each other so in so many ways things have kind of turned around and we have to do some serious thinking what is it going to take to restore the the social supports for an effective democracy I mean I do wonder if one of the things that it's gonna take is something that's completely unpalatable to one side of the political aisle at least and that is a return to social institutions that people don't like very much particularly on the left so you I want to ask you about that in just one second first let's talk about your psychiatric health today's show is sponsored by talk space the online therapy company that

falls through I'll be the guy at the end of the commercials who issues all of the legal warnings so if we were talking about the sort of forces that need to come back together it seems like there there are certain forces that it's almost impossible to bring back together and the ones that most need to be brought back together are the ones that maybe least palate but what I mean by that to clarify is that social fabric for 200 years of hundreds of years throughout Western civilization was basically based in church you found your community in the church in the synagogue you had a common judeo-christian heritage and with the rise of secularism which has come along with a lot of economic benefits for sure and a lot of diversity in terms of the kinds of people who are treated well there's also been a consummate decline a consonant decline in the social fabric that what's tearing people apart seems a lot stronger than what's bringing us together and it seems like that hole is being filled by political tribalism I'm gonna fill those values with whatever I think my tribe is and it seems to me particularly now to get to the left-right issue and obviously I'm on the right and I have plenty of criticisms for the right but my main criticism of the left these days is that the left has fallen into a sort of tribalism that refuses to even acknowledge that another tribe exists or that there's other there are other people who perceive problems differently so to go back to your discussion of the various values in righteous mind you suggest that basically the political left bases itself on a couple of values fairness and harm well if those are the values you base yourself upon then by necessity you have to be implying even to yourself that the other side is for unfairness and for harm that in order for that there cannot be any bridging of the gap because the only values that matter are harm perceived as anything bad that happens anything I disagree with results in a certain number of people getting hurt and fairness in that person who disagrees with me is in favor of the reinstitution of a patriarchy or a hierarchical system and you're spotting that evil everywhere you look how can that possibly be bridged without folks on the left actually acknowledging that there are other sets of values that they come into play and that those ones actually drive people and may not be in fact bad yeah so I think what you're pointing to is an asymmetry and mutual understanding and I have evidence that that's that that's true so I run a research site at your morals org and we've had about a half a million people go to there go there and take our surveys and in one experiment we had people take our basic instrument the moral foundations questionnaire which it gives you a score on these five foundations and we had one third of the people just filled it out fist them cells one third we're told please fill this out as the typical liberal and progressive would one third were told to fill it out as a typical conservative what we found is that moderates are able to correctly predict how everybody would fill it out conservatives were almost as good as moderates and it was people on the left especially the far left were very inaccurate and it's for precisely the reason that you say that because they couldn't see these questions about loyalty and fairness and sanctity they they couldn't see those as moral virtues so on the questions about harm and fairness they said well conservatives don't care about cruelty to animals and children so I do think and this was my case too you know I was very well educated in the United States which means I learned nothing about conservatism I learned very little about a large portion of political philosophy and so it's impossible to grow up in this country without knowing what the left believes through the media through newspapers through movies but I do agree that the left often fails to understand the right and this is why we parentally have these issues on the Left where my god we how you know how could they have voted from I don't know anybody who voted that way what were they thinking and so political surprises tend to be where the left is surprised they're there and as happened in brexit there I think they have a harder time understanding conservatives than vice-versa I personally think that every high school civics class not that they teach them much anymore but high school civics class should include the best of progressive thinking the best of conservative thinking possibly libertarian too we shouldn't we shouldn't encounter political diversity through the lens of the worst because social media guarantees if you're on one side you are force-fed constant stories of the outrages by the most outrageous horrible people on the other side and if that's your view of who they are of course you don't trust them of course you don't want your legislators to compromise so I think we need to understand we are coming apart in this country we are faced in the actual danger of the dissolution of the country over the next 10 20 years I'm not saying it's likely to happen I think it's not likely to happen but it is possible in ways that none of us thought we're coming or a possible five or ten years ago so I think we need to take this seriously start educating beginning in high school for more political tolerance respect and mutual understanding so when it comes to the sort of pessimism that you're expressing about the nature of the country with which I fully agree there are a bunch of people who do disagree there are folks like Steven Pinker who's claiming that everything is getting better there are a lot of folks on the Left who have suggested that problems on campus which we discuss at length and the coddling of the American mind that these are exaggerated that basically campuses are just fine that there's tolerance for other points of view how do you respond to to those particular criticisms one that everything is getting better and is just fine generally and two that college campuses are hunky-dory except for a few weird sort of yeah straying from the mean all right great questions let's take the first one so Steve Pinker I think is brilliant I think he in the big picture I'm pretty confident he's right that if we were just to check in at hundred year intervals each hundred years things would be much better than the hundred years before now of course at some point we might see the smoking wreckage of a global nuclear war but odds are he's right in the long run but as he grants and as Robert Reich granted in his book non zero years ago you can have some big setbacks it's only within the big picture that you see that the March grass but along the way you can have some pretty bad stuff happening and I think where we are now a lot some of our problem is caused by social media of course these problems of polarization were getting worse before social media but social media is really messing things up all around the world odds are we'll learn how to deal with it as we've learned how to deal with junk food it took decades before we could learn how to live with the constant presence of junk food I heard that for the first time last year the obesity rate in America actually went down a tiny bit so maybe we've learned how to coexist and maybe that will happen with social media but a lot of bad stuff can happen along the way in terms of what's going on on campus there's been a really productive debate as an excellent debate started by some political scientists in Canada Jeff Sachs who pointed out that if you look at the the general social survey attitudes about free speech it's not changing in fact if anything younger people are more tolerant and so that pushed me and Greg and others to refine our claims and that's the way it's supposed to work and what we what we found is we dug into the data is yes this National Survey data shows no drop but that's because it's focused on Millennials and this book our book the coddling of the American mind is not about Millennials the Millennials are fine on free speech it's the generation after the Millennials it's the kids born in 1995 and after they were raised very different than we'll come back to that cuz that's a major topic to talk about so if you just look at IGN or Gen Z and you grant the point that the skeptics made that there are 4,500 colleges in this country or institutions of a high rate of some sort are all of them up in arms over conservative speakers no most of them are not most of them don't have concert decks they don't you know the commuter schools they don't bring in lecturers they don't have riots so if you look at nationally representative data on most campuses nothing is happening if you go home to a family if you have a job off-campus you're not going to develop this arcane morality that will talk about this safety as a morality however if you look at especially in the Northeast and the west coast if you look at the elite schools there as far as I can tell this new culture is present at almost all of the schools it's not an engineering school so much its dominant in the humanities so varies even within the universities my point is there's a lot of diversity this is not we should not have a moral panic where we say the new generation is lost something's eaten their brains or colleges are going up in flames that's not true but there is a new morality that is present in parts of most maybe all elite schools on the coast that's where the shout downs and and what little violence there's been that's where that takes place so we have to refine the story figure out what's happening and I think figure out how to how to reverse this cultural shift because it leads to a culture that's really bad for the students themselves in the mental health and it's really bad for a culture of free inquiry so how indicative are those outlier schools statistically of a broader trend across young folks that's yeah that's complicated to answer in terms of broad trends across young folks they're one the most important one the one that I think guarantees that we will be attending to this for many years to come we cannot sweep this under the rug is that rates of anxiety and depression are rising quickly for kids born after 1995 it's rising across social classes across races not so much across genders or rather I should say it's things are getting worse for boys substantially but for girls it's several times were several times faster the increase and what's very important understand because there's debate around this some people say oh you know kids they like to say they're depressed they're comfortable with this language there was a not that there was a not been the New York Times last couple weeks ago by a psychiatrist saying oh you know it's not real it's just changing diagnostic categories no because if you look their studies we cite them in the book if you look at hospital admission data this is the number of kids admitted because they cut their body with something sharp and had to be admitted to a hospital it shows exactly the same pattern as it does for depression anxiety that is its way up it's up even for the 11 to 13 year olds and it's up especially for girls and then you look at the suicide data this is CDC data federal data same thing the boys suicide rate for teenage boys from the first decade of the 20th century first century to the last couple years it begins going up around 2010-2011 its top 20 85% 25% more dead boys by their own hand over the last 10 10 or so years for girls the increases 70% 7 zero so this is not just some isolated thing on a few college campuses we have a mental health crisis across social classes across all the different divides on the elite college campuses this is contributing to a culture of protectiveness we're vulnerable or at least even if I'm not involved well she's vulnerable he is vulnerable I am standing up for them we can't have Ben Shapiro talk here for example and this is where the microaggression culture comes in the idea of speeches violence which was chanted at me proposed at Berkeley which is it which is an insane concept just on the face of especially at Berkeley yeah it's it's it's pretty wild over there but and what was really wild about that one is the the radical shift because I had spoken there the previous year with no violence whatsoever the next year I required 500 police officers for protection for some odd reason but what exactly does this trend hold true across parenting styles across cultures or is it or is it just a subsection that we're really talking about yeah so this is also new that I I can't give you a solid answer we don't have data on this what we we do in a section in the book we did spend some time researching social class differences because we know there's a huge amount of research on social class differences in parenting and we read two really good books Annette Lareau has a book called unequal childhoods and Robert Putnam um has a book called our kids and they both come to the same conclusion which is that differences by race and parenting are actually fairly small once you control for class so upper middle-class black parents are more similar to upper middle-class white parents than they are to working-class of either sex and so working-class parents do give their kids less supervision which is good part of the problem is in the 90s we took away most of kids on supervised time by the ages or 90s we stopped letting kids out to play without supervision it's fearing but they we thought they'd be abducted or something like that so the working class is not as overprotective now working-class kids have a lot of other problems they face a lot more trauma a lot more threat like real trauma like physical trauma relational trauma but in this country right now at elite schools there was some breeze came out last year at many of our top schools there are more kids we're children of the top 1% income then the bottom 60% so our elite schools are populated overwhelmingly by the top few percent of the income distribution and that's part of it rich kids have a lot more time to do symbolic politics working-class kids they have to pay their they have to pay their tuition they have a lot of other obligations so the the culture of safety isms to be especially intense in upper-middle class upper class elite coastal communities when it comes to the identity politics that's cropped up so recently and and you sort of classify as a subset of emotional tribal driven politics where is the identity politics issue coming from doesn't have deep roots or shallow roots and is it really just a new form of the kind of tribalism you've been talking about so so here so let me make a point here which I hope will be helpful to your audience in this country we're in the middle of a long-running culture war in which terms become they get tagged and they get used either as a tax or defense is an identity politics and social justice or two of those terms and you know our my you know I work on a college campus Greg and I work on college campuses we really want to solve the problem we don't want to score points we don't want to bash people we really want to solve the problem my view from writing the righteous mind is that whenever you have a a political movement there's always something that it that they're right about there's always something that is good or true about it and so what we did with identity politics you know cuz I came in very suspicious of it thinking you know this is probably a bad thing but as we read about it we realized okay you know what you have to have identity politics if if people can organize because they're wine growers in California they can form a group to advocate for the rights of wine growers in California and you know and chess players can I mean you can have you know politics should be responsive to every possible interest group why can't gay people or LGBTQ weic weick an african-american of course every group can organize so you can't say identity politics is bad what you need to do is say okay in in the current American context how are you pursuing the aims of your group and this I think is a distinction that I found just clarified things right away you can either pursue it using a common humanity approach which is exactly what Martin Luther King Pauli Murray a lot of the early civil rights activists did common humanity you start by saying listen my brothers and sisters or you you use this soaring American language as he didn't as I have a dream speech you you you first establish we we Americans we human beings they used a lot of religious language they a Christian language but it's obviously judeo-christian language you start that way and now right away you're already halfway down the road to success because now you're talking to people as members of a common group and you can say some of our brothers and sisters are being denied access to dignity to jobs so that worked even if of course there was resistance at the time it calls on our better angels it established the connection and in the long run it works that we think is great what's new or at least what's it newly intense on college campuses in the last just a few years is what we call the common enemy form of identity politics it's based on the idea that Bedouin proverb me against my brother me and my brother against our cousin me my brother and cousin against the stranger and if you unite everybody on campus against the enemy and the enemy is on campus to because the enemy is straight white males so what's new is the idea of intersectionality which as we say in the book intersectionality is not a bad idea the idea that identities interact that being a black woman is not just the sum of the two but there are special special obstacles that black women face that's a fine idea that's right and true but the way that it gets implemented on campus is to train students to see look around oh you know a female white and to see okay female is oppressed male there's a presser white is a presser black is oppressed so see people in binary dimensions to to to to imagine trying to create a diverse environment on a college campus you're trying to create diversity and at the same time you're telling people to judge others through this simple binary bipolar dimension good bad good bad to make moral judgments of people so intersectionality as it's practiced on many campuses amounts to trying to unite a coalition of victim groups against the evil straight white males and this is a recipe for in addition to miss diagnosing the nature of not just American society but especially college campuses it trains students to it's trained students to be man icky and it trains them to approach life and relationships through the lens of good and evil we've got to tone that down if we want a successful diverse society isn't there a deeper critique of identity politics even than that because you're taking identity politics at sort of its most favorable level to say people feel an identity with for example I feel identity with other Jews but to suggest that all Jews are necessarily in the same boat which is sort of the basis of identity politics for you to group yourself with a group of people is to imply a common enemy of some sort that's so should should we be fighting harder against identity politics than even you're saying in other words let's not group ourselves as blacks or Jews or gays let's let's group ourselves as a group of individuals who all agree on these common principles of how the society ought to be governed and how we ought to be left alone yes I certainly agree with you on that that to what extent should we encourage people to see themselves as members of identity groups or should we encourage them to think that black people are a certain way Jews are a certain way I think one of the great triumphs in the last few centuries has been to create a world that was especially clear for Jews you know Jews were literally kept in ghettos and it wasn't until the Enlightenment ideas finally spread the Jews are allowed to make lives for themselves the liberal tradition is ultimately about long room for people to make the lives that they want it can choose to identify with a group or not a really encouraging sign is that over the last few years a lot of people who are not straight white males have been have been told you need to identify this way and they're they're saying like no I don't how dare you tell me how dare you tell me how I should feel and at first it was maybe hard for them to say but in the last year a lot are saying it and so there's all these great books that now Francis Fukuyama has a new book just came out about identity and dignity Anthony Appiah has been writing beautifully about this Amy Amy Chua political tribes so we're finding and there's a lot more so I think this is very encouraging America is a diverse country there are a lot of intellectuals in every different possible identity category and a lot of them are rejecting this binary you're in or out kind of identity well politically doesn't this tend toward libertarianism just naturally because the what you're really talking about on a political level is we all have an agreement about the basic things that we should all do together and then everybody should basically be left alone to identify how they how they please how does this play out politically in terms of you know if you were taking two straight party politics so you know as I hear you talk what I'm thinking is that's really the definition of liberal and what I mean is the word liberal its origins are you believe in Liberty its origins are originally you know if the liberal arts are the skills needed to be a free person in an open society and so that's when we talk about liberal arts schools we talk about the liberal tradition that's what it means and so that's that in that sense I'm a liberal now I stopped using the word as the Left began to kind of split between what I like to think of is there's the liberal left and then there's the illiberal left most professors in my opinion are liberal left they are uncomfortable with many forms of identity politics but it's the illiberal left that has has had the loudest voice it's it's often dangerous as you found as many people about it's dangerous to stand up against them dangerous then I shouldn't I here I go I shouldn't talk about D you you'll get a lot of blowback and a lot of hatred I swear I should say at times dangerous I've had actually from time to time I've had wear bulletproof vests so yeah that's occasionally dangerous occasion but you're right I mean and I've said many times that the best I speak on dozens of campuses it's really only a couple of year that are a serious problem but yes and that's great just the abit this is right this is one of the things we most need in this polarized time just just that little bit of nuance that you just added that goes so far if we can just leave whenever we're having these conflicts these talk just to acknowledge anything about the other side and then you can make your critique I think that's just listeners everywhere this is the way to be more effective if you don't believe me read Dale Carnegie how to win for influence people this is the number one technique so but your question was is does that mean we should be libertarian and I guess I would say it ought to mean that we should be liberal in the traditional sense unfortunately the libertarians are sort of left as the guardians of the of the liberal traditions so what what do you think has been the response to all of your research which has been a lot friendlier to that to the right than a lot of other things that have been said in sociology departments around the country how people react in the Academy to you because we've seen cases ranging from Evergreen State College to Northwestern were to Yale with the Christakis is where people are legitimately run out of jobs become witch-hunts in the book what's what's been the reaction to your work have you got anything for blowback no I have not nothing bad has happened to me you know other than you know I occasionally get horribly nasty tweets and I got an email the other day which was from an anonymous server and it was just a string of obscenities which I can't even say on camera I mean yes yeah so other than strangers nothing bad has happened to me and I think this is actually very important to point out so when I started critiquing the left from the left you know there were some people are suspicious of me but a lot of people realized you know the left we do have problems we do need this critique and because I would do it in a sort of a gentle way and because I clearly was not on the right so I think I moved up to sort of the edge of what was possible nothing bad ever happened to me then when I stepped out and I started saying I'm not on the left anymore I'm just on nothing I'm not on a team again I thought there'd be blowback and some people were suspicious some people didn't like me but nothing bad happened to me and then when Greg and I wrote our Atlantic article critiquing this new culture on campus and it is a critique of a certain kind of identity politics you know my wife said John are we gonna have to like hide our address like are people gonna stalk us nothing bad happened to us because by 2015 people all over the place were beginning realize something weird is happening were puzzled and if you come out with an explanation of like here's what we think is happening people are really curious and now with this book again I was actually kind of afraid like you know what's gonna happen to me I have tenure I'm not gonna lose my job but left what's gonna happen to me socially and the reception has been overwhelmingly positive because again people realize something is mess stop you know the mental health crisis is real something's going on so yeah it's and this is I guess my advice to people is if you speak up in this polarized climate we were a lot of us are afraid to speak up but if you can do it in a respectful way with just a little bit of nuance the blowback is often much less than you then you would expect so you teased much earlier in the show that you have a lot of critiques of the Republican Party because I am of course I'm a conservative that means we spend most of this program critiquing leftists on campus and some of the head of rising leftist ideas of identity politics intersectionality microaggressions and such so what are your main critiques of the right how could the right be doing a better job and what exactly is the right doing deeply wrong right now well you know so what really attracted me to conservatism was reading the philosophy so in one of my gateway drugs was Thomas solo I read conflict of visions and boy that book when I assigned it to my classes at UVA you know that really opened people's eyes and he talks about are you do you have to constrain view of human nature which is where you think people if you take off the constraints they're gonna do selfish greedy sexual aggressive things and we need religion family law versus the unconstrained vision which goes back to Rousseau or it's it's it's the John Lennon song imagine just knock down all the walls remove religion and country everything will be great um you know what you when I look at it that way as a social scientist I have to say the conservatives are right about human nature that is the correct view of human nature and that goes back to our early part of our conversation about how we need structures we need constraints in order to flourish so I'm very attracted to a lot of conservative philosophy and that goes all the way up you know from Burke all the way through Sol you know and Hayek and others were conservative libertarian so I'm attracted to a lot of the philosophy and of course I disliked Ronald Reagan and the Republican Party back then when I was a partisan Democrat but I can see the wisdom of of fomenting dynamism of I can see the wisdom of a lot of what the Republican Party was doing that and George HW Bush was a very very decent man but I look at the Republican parties well since Newt Gingrich I think converted to a much more confrontational party which again I can't create a that the Democrats didn't treat the Republicans well when they were in the majority but I think Newt Gingrich and Fox News created an environment in which in which the Republicans were more incentivized to sort of go rogue to develop an India - - based on feedback and and opportunities to be more radical and I think some of the policies that they've implemented the worst critique of the Republican Party or what common critique is all they seem to really care about is lowering taxes on the rich that seems to be their top priority and that that's been true for a while and so a party that is just focused on its relationship with its donor class and then its ability to do things you know I don't well don't get me started on Trump but the things that Trump is doing to destroy our alliances to disrespect our allies while sucking up to dictators and the fact that the Republican Party has not repudiated him so I think that Trump clearly is not a conservative he is appealing much more to authoritarian tendencies then there's I can't see I can't see any lineage from Edmund Burke to Donald Trump there is there's no way to get from here to there so the fact that the Republican Party has lost its conservative soul I think has fallen Donald Trump is I think a mark of damnation that it will wear for many decades we quote research in the book on how however the political world looks between the ages of 14 and 24 sticks and so I think the Republican Party is signing I can't say it's death warrant but I think it's going to lose a generation of the young people now they will vote more democratic for the next 50 years I mean I'd to agree with that assessment which is one of my great fears about president Trump before he was president Trump was that the I listed several fears about President Trump that I had in my chief one which I think is still on the table as the toxification of conservatism thanks to all of this with that said is there any way to put the political genie back in the bottle because it seems like political leaders of both sides have a real interest in revving up the culture wars and I think that when it comes to you know Republican legislative priorities it has less to do with the stuff they'd like to do and the stuff that they can actually do without blowback so tax cuts are popular because who exactly is gonna whine about them everyone at least got a check right and when it comes to the left but if a debt and the deficit which Republicans were the watchdog's of and for the last 20 years they've been the bad guys well I I totally agree with that but the point is that there's the stuff that people can get done in Congress then there's the stuff that people can jabber about in Congress and by looking to our politicians as our moral leaders by looking to our politicians as our philosophical leaders what we've actually done is create the the sort of room for this divide between practical politics and the stuff that we think that they ought to be saying philosophically when the politicians are seen as as thought leaders Barack Obama was seen as a thought leader for the left and then he implements a bunch of policies that are completely partisan I mean he has no bipartisan legislation throughout any of his tenure and yet he is seen by the left as some sort of great bipartisan unifier and and the right responds by saying okay fine we'll just put somebody up there who doesn't pretend to be bipartisan we'll just go out there and he'll do whatever he wants is there any way to put this genie back in the bottle because there is money to be made and votes to be gained in the sort of tribalism that both of us are sort of railing against you well first I have to defend Obama he came out so if you go back to the first election the economic crisis threatened us with ruin nobody knew was gonna happen it was a really scary time ten years ago and Obama did the right thing which is to say we're gonna do this bipartisan this is not a partisan thing we're gonna do this bipartisan and we have to do this together and he and going back to his 2004 speech I believe that Obama really does he does actually understand conservatives better than most he lived in Indonesia he's traveled a lot I think Obama I like him philosophically and he can't started the right way the Republicans however there was a particular retreat they had early in Obama's in the first couple months of his term it summer in Maryland may I Cameron Bure it was and they did a calculation and they said should we work with him and try to make him successful or should we try to make him fail which will work better for us and they correctly calculated that the second course was best for them and that was Obama's fault because Obama was very bad at negotiating Obama should have said again this is my my political analysis which is not worth much Obama should have said back-channel we're gonna do this bipartisan you have three months to join me on it if you don't join me I'm gonna break your knees I'm gonna blame it all on you and we're gonna do it my way but because Obama didn't play hardball and he did this internationally - because he didn't know how to negotiate and have a tough side the Republicans correctly calculated that they could roll him but they could they could make him fail and it worked they came sweeping into power two years later so I can't fault Obama Obama didn't come in trying to be you see and then also on the health insurance yeah it was he got no Republican votes but he tried and tried and tried to take a Republican idea from Mitt Romney for how to do health reform so Obama tried and it was this hyper partisan Republican party that I think drove him ultimately to have to just do it in a partner obviously I would disagree with that political analysis almost in full but I do think that election 2012 was basically in my view sort of the breaking of the country because by election 2012 there was a belief on the right that Mitt Romney was a decent guy who was pretty moderate and a lot of his politics the only one fuckin would ever provided Obamacare for a state and then he was torn apart and savaged as a bad guy and exactly the same way the left savages Donald Trump except that Mitt Romney is not Donald Trump and so we've now been locked into this mutual Rock'em Sock'em robots combat where it's a lot easier to punch the other guy than to have a conversation with them so how do we get beyond all this because obviously you proposed a lot of solutions and coddling up the American mind you talk about solutions a lot how do we get beyond all of this even based on the original premise of righteous mind which is that we are mostly intuitional for mostly intuitional how do the the lizard brain is extraordinarily strong with us how do we get past that and exercise reason or does reason exist what facility do we use to move beyond is it's very difficult to just decide to change the forces the historical trends that God is in to this rising polarization are complicated they're a lot of them there's no one thing we can turn around and change I think the most basic thing we need to do is we need to have some major reforms of our political institutions to encourage more moderation compromise and cooperation in Congress and at other levels of government what I'm hoping would happen this is an idea from from Norm Ornstein who wrote the book it's even worse than it looks at political scientists is at some point the next president somebody will say okay we're in big trouble here everybody hates Congress Congress doesn't want to be hated let's have let's have let's have a panel recommend a sweeping set of changes to make the legislative process more effective to stop - we can't be shutting out the the minor party entirely we can't be having well for the filibusters going away for a lot of reasons so we have to have reform - the way Congress works the way elections are run the closed party primary really incentivizes extremists to run because that's how you win the nomination so some states are experimenting with open primaries or with top two primaries as you have here in California so I think we need a whole package of political reforms for Congress the issue of the media and social media reforms they are much harder there I don't really know there are tweaks that Facebook and Twitter can do to their algorithms YouTube videos but all I can think of is tweaks that it's very hard to change to change the media environment education we've already talked about we need to be educating kids for democracy we're not doing that one of the suggestions we make in the book is that however bad things are the young generation which has had very little time to work out problems they've been given very little freedom and independence when the current generation i gen or Gen Z when they reach their the age of political power things might get a lot worse because they haven't worked out the skills of compromise dispute resolution on their own so I think we're in big trouble and we're gonna have to take a comprehensive look at how we raise children how we educate them in high school in college how our political institutions work I've done what I can Greg and I've done what we can in our book this is gonna take a collaboration among political scientists and historians to really focus as we're focusing on other threats to the country I'm to really focus on the threats to our democracy without blaming one side or the other saying the system is messed up if we want to be a light to the world if we think that democracy and liberty are important virtues we need to get our own house in order and this is I think where you know I D / a really deep solution is gonna require a rebuilding of a social fabric that has almost nothing to do with politics and when we watch the social fabric torn apart on everything from sneakers to football it seems very difficult to put all of back together I think they eat it seems to me that bipartisan legislation is not gonna make everybody feel better about everything it seems like the whatever whatever legislative remedies are sought to various problems just because you got a Democrat and Republican shaking hands it doesn't heal the problem what we have here is that neighbors don't trust each other neighbors don't see each other in any social setting neighbors don't if the only thing that we have in common is government we have nothing in common that's right so is so how do we rebuild but we spend some time on individual parenting you're a parent obviously you have a 12 year old an 8 year old I'm a parent with two kids under five what's the best way to educate your kids to be part of that social fabric to rebuild democracy from the ground up in every generation so we have a whole chapter on play and why play is so important for the development of any human being and why play basically lets you practice the skills of democracy when Alexis de Tocqueville traveled in America in 1831 he was so impressed he said you know in in France if some great thing needs to be done it's gonna be done by the the monarch and in England it's gonna be done by the aristocrats but in America if they need to build a bridge or start a hospital they get a bunch of people together they form an association Americans have a genius for the art of Association he said and we cite research in the book on how play is the practice for the art of Association a pickup soccer game three kids sitting around what should we do this afternoon I don't know what do you want to do and then they figure it out jointly so so what I'm with my kids it's hard because all the parents are overprotective including us when we try to send our kids out like we send them out to go do an errand go across the street my son would say but daddy everybody looks at me funny because there no other kids out there so it's a social coordination problem I'm hopeful that Americans will realize we have a mental health catastrophe we've got to do something forget politics we've got to do something for the well-being of our kids so I urge you I urge every every viewer every listener go to let grow dot-org it's an organization started by leonora skin AZ who wrote the book free-range kids I'm on the board and has all kinds of suggestions for how you can make your neighborhood and your elementary school and all your schools how you can make them better able to support free-range child rearing kids having a few hours a day in which there's not an adult watching them how you can get administrators to back off and give them more room so we have a lot of ideas there for how you can address the problems from childhood up through a high school next we have to look at all of our institutions all the places that we congregate and so let's talk about so religious congregations workplaces universities beginning a year or two ago I started getting calls or hearing from you know CEO is saying we're being torn apart Oh battles over bathrooms battles over this or a lot of the identity politics issues which again have to be solved but that if you do it in the common enemy way it's impossible to solve so leaders of almost any organization or have our facing these problems my rabbi I go to central synagogue in Manhattan my rabbi you know when a rabbi speaks it says anything about Israel oh my god like you know a third of the congregation is gonna revolt whichever way you go so leadership now is really really hard my team we developed a wonderful program called open mind so I urge our jurors go to open mind platform org we've created a program runs on any app it's free and any any platform it's free in which it walks you through some basic moral psychology in a sense it kind of walks you through the righteous mind and some other social psychology about why the you point diversity is good for you makes you smarter it makes you better able to deal with people why it's so hard to do that how do you talk to people how do you talk to people who different and our belief our hope and we have some evidence is that if any group takes this training it only takes about an hour and a half um if any group does this training whenever whenever problems come up they'll be they'll have be better skilled they'll have a common vocabulary they'll be able to resolve it so I think we need to see this as a national crisis rising polarization which is making all of our institutions less functional my fear is that if the Nike gambit pays off for Nike more companies will do that we'll have red and blue restaurants red and blue you know dentists will everything will be politics all the time my god what a nightmare that will be so we all have to take responsibility for this and it starts with us as individuals and then steps right away from us as individuals into every organization or institution that we're part of we can all be part of the solution at that more local level I do have one final question and that final question will be what is best-case scenario for the country in 20 years what's worst-case scenario for the country in 20 years but if you want to hear the answer from
