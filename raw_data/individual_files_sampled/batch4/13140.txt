so President Trump has a new nickname for stormy Daniels and Elizabeth Warren's native-american tale collapses and Michael avenatti had a bad day and now he's having a slightly better days we will get into all the avenatti related things I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show this is certainly the most entertaining timeline I mean I don't know what happened what black hole we fell through to emerge from the other side where the President of the United States is calling a woman horseface he once had sex with and she is insulting his genitalia as a mushroom character from a 1997 video game but all I can say is I'm very happy fell into this particular black hole because it's deeply interesting I have so much to say about so many things today but first let's talk about another podcast that you should actually listen to there are hundreds of thousands of legal cases in litigation every day in the United States court system most of them will never reach the media's attention but the ones that you know about well you don't know as much as you think you do which is why you ought to listen to a podcast from andriy called legal wars host Hill Harper gives you behind-the-scenes access into some of the most famous cases to have ever graced America's courtrooms you'll hear about influential cases that have changed the face of America things like the Rodney King trial or Anna Nicole Smith's battle for her inheritance or the takedown of the gossip site Gawker go listen to legal Wars on Apple podcast the first episode is about Hulk Hogan versus Gawker which actually did change the way media is done in the United States this is a case in which Hogan walked out of the courtroom with a multi-million dollar settlement but you don't know the whole story until you've listened to legal Wars you can find legal Wars on Apple podcasts wherever you're listening to this or head over to Wonder e dot F M / Ben that's wo ND ER y FM slash been wondering if m / ben you can go check out legal wars from honoré other podcasts are awesome but this one is particularly entertaining and I've really enjoyed listening to it so go check it out right now legal wars on Apple podcast or at wonder if m / Ben it's great you're gonna have fun listening to it alright so did you think that yesterday's news cycle was going to be the pinnacle of insanity did you think that we had really reached the apex of crazy and hilarious with Elizabeth Warren revealing a test that supposedly showed that she was Native American only to show that she is significantly less Native American than a Jeep Grand Cherokee were you a person who thought you know maybe we finally reached the summit of ridiculousness with Elizabeth Warren claiming that she was a member of the Cherokee Nation when in fact Elizabeth Warren is whiter than this piece of paper did you think well you ain't seen nothing yet it's 2018 gang boom so President Trump leads off this morning and he had a bunch of tweets about Elizabeth Warren we'll get to those in just a second but we begin we begin with the President of the United States who's decided that he doesn't like stormy Daniels anymore our producer Sonya is down with illness but we'll make a Taylor Swift reference for her here it turns out they are never ever ever getting back together so here is what happened there's a lawsuit that stormy Daniels had filed against the President of the United States who's always a frivolous stupid lawsuit anybody with a law degree knew this and there was a suit in which she sued him for defamation after he tweeted that she was engaged in a total con job and she he tweeted a sketch years later about a non-existent man a total con job playing the fake news media for fools this is when she claimed that she was stalked by a guy who was sent by Trump and she sued him for defamation okay that's not information she's a public figure defamation is knowing and knowingly and maliciously attacking someone false information it's knowing and malicious is the standard for public figures it wasn't knowing and it wasn't malicious it was just basically free speech in him giving an opinion but she sued him for defamation and then it was thrown out the case was thrown out and here's what the judge wrote the court agrees with mr. Trump's argument because the tweet in question constitutes rhetorical hyperbole normally associated with politics and public discourse in the United States the First Amendment protects this type of rhetorical statement not only that the judge ruled that stormy Daniels now had to pay Trump's legal fees ouch so the presidents of the United States had a had a response on Twitter remember this is an office once occupied by Abraham Lincoln George Washington Ronald Reagan here's the President of the United States official statement on his Twitter account quote Federer the judge throws out stormy Daniels the suit versus Trump Trump is entitled to full legal fees great now I can go after her his face and her third-rate liar in the great state of Texas she would confirm the letter she signed she knows nothing about me a total con well that's one way to step on a news cycle so we could have done an entire week of Elizabeth Warren now we will do an entire week of the presidents of the United States calling a woman he once had sex with horseface yeah so that's a thing now a couple of different things to note here first of all if you had to sum up this entire is entire news cycle in one meme it would be President Trump as The Lone Ranger silver would be horse face stormy Daniels and Tonto would be Elizabeth Warren so our artistic geniuses in the backroom are cooking up that one right now but with that said is it good that the President of the United States calls any woman horse face no probably not a good thing is it smart that he calls a woman he once had sex with horse face well it does call into judge from it does call into question his judgment regarding women it's kind of a weird thing to do like you have sex with a woman you're not married to and then you call her horse face is that more of a rip on her or rip on your taste because it's kind of weird also just politically speaking is that gonna make for a good news cycle that now we're gonna get media outraged about Trump calling woman horse face like a week and a half after the Brett Kavanaugh saga in which the Left wanted to launch a war on women and failed is that gonna be good no but no one ever accused the president of not stepping on his own mushroom so it's really it's it's it's not great I'll be honest with you I think that there are flaws in this in this line of thinking then when the president got up this morning he thought you know what I'm gonna tweet about sir my daniels and her horse face I hosted other away didn't I linden linden um yeah not great not great okay now just from an objective an objective human point of view is it hilarious of course it's hilarious okay we can appreciate two things at once Trump when it comes to women is a garbage human hey I've said this 1 million times because it is 1 million times true he is not great with women when I say not great with women I mean that this is a man who said in the 1970s that avoiding STDs was his own personal Vietnam this is a guy who nailed anything that moved for about 40 years here and this is it this is a man who is very lucky they're not lots of little legitimate Trump's walking around like Trump has not been shy about his treatment of women I mean he was caught on tape in the last election cycles saying an Access Hollywood tape that he grabbed women by their by their hooves so it's it's it's very it's like there's nothing shocking here but just from a pure human point of view are we through the looking-glass are we in the middle of idiocracy you bet your ass little vidi accuracy I mean my goodness I guess I got to the stables every morning and they're to his face horse face and toad from Mario Cart in American romance that's where we are so all good stuff the other narrative of the day is that Elizabeth Warren as Tonto is not actually Native American so she claimed that she was Native American and many many many many many times she claims that she was Native American in legal journals she claimed that she was Native American an award that you want from University of Pennsylvania Law School she claimed that she was Native American in a story that she told over and over and over a romantic story Romeo and Juliet story about her mother a native Amer approve American woman wandering the plains who met her father and her father brought her home but the in-laws were racist racist and said you can't bring home that Native American woman you can't bring home that that Indian get out of here and then apparently her parents eloped and they had a beautiful romance from there on and well it turns out that Elizabeth Warren is not in fact Native American but it was funny to watch as the narrative turned yesterday so yesterday Elizabeth Warren started this whole thing off by releasing a video of her and her family members talking about how Native American she was and here was what the video sounded like this isn't just about casual racism war hoops and tomahawk chops and Native communities have faced discrimination neglect and violence for generations and Trump can say whatever he wants about me but mocking Native Americans or any group in order to try to get at me that's not what America stands for some people have questioned my heritage in my family history maybe they do it to insult me maybe they do it to distract from the kinds of changes I'm fighting for and the kind of change I'm trying to bring to Washington maybe they do it because they think politics is a bloodsport but my parents were real people the love they shared the struggle spanned or the family they built the story they lived will always be etched on my heart man and no one not even the President of the United States don't ever take it away the story is etched on her heart edged on her heart and then she goes to all our family members who are talking about their Native American heritage and then she releases a study and the study shows that she's what maybe maybe not totally maybe one 1000 24th Native American one 1000 24th Native American which is just awesome it's just awesome in every way so she releases that and watches her tweets evolve over the course of the day so she starts off by saying this by the way a real Donald Trump remember saying on 7 5 July 5th that you'd give a million dollars to a charity of my choice if my DNA showed Native American ancestry I remember and here's the verdict please send the check to the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center a number one that's how he said what he said is if you prove you're Native American and then I'll give you a million bucks shouldn't prove she was Native American she proved that she is whiter than any person the side of marky-mark and then she continued tweeting but watch our tweets evolve and IWR see is a non-profit working to protect Native women from violence more than half of all Native women have experienced sexual violence and the majority of violent crimes against Native Americans are perpetrated by non-natives send them your one million dollar check Donald Trump and then she continues along these lines I took the test and released the results for anyone who cares to see because I've got nothing to hide what are you hiding Donald Trump release your tax returns or the democratic-led house will do it for you soon enough tick-tock mr. president no there's one of most annoying things on Twitter these days the tick-tock rutila well tick-tock and we're ticking down to something big or it turns down we are ticking down to you completely collapsing in on yourself like a dying star she continues and she says having some Rinat problems Donald Trump should we call for a doctor here's something you won't forget mr. president you're the least popular president in modern history and your allies will go down hard in the midterm elections 22 days tick tock tick tock oh god oh god amen she could but then she concludes I won't sit quietly for Donald Trump's racism so I took a test but but DNA and family history has nothing to do with tribal affiliation or citizenship which is determined only only by tribal nations I respect a distinction and don't list myself as native in the Senate what happened like I mean that was a sudden left turn is like when Michael Scott was driving on the road and the GPS told him to drive into the lake that's basically how that sweet thread went he just he's talking and she's talking about yeah I'm Native American and and Native Americans are great and give us some money in Native American logic but I'm not Native American what could have happened to trigger such a change what could have happened to Tonto we will explain in just one second but first let's talk about your omega-3 levels if you're experiencing joint pain or chronic inflammation lack

conditions do apply so what could have changed Elizabeth Warren's mind what could have changed her mind she was saying very confidently that she was Native American that she was Native American and then ulsan well you know it turns out the tribes get to decide who's Native American why why because the Cherokee Nation came out and said you're not Native American the chair that now let's be clear about this the Cherokee Nation does not come out and make political statements very often but they sends out their Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin to issue a statement he said quote a DNA test is useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America sovereigns tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA tests can be used to determine lineage such as paternity to an individual it is not evidence for tribal affiliation and then they continued using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong it makes a mockery out of DNA tests and it's legitimate uses while also dishonouring legitimate tribal governments and their citizens whose ancestors are well documented and whose heritage is proven senator warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage ouch-ouch so she just got slammed by the Cherokee Nation to which she claims ancestral membership yeah that went poorly for Elizabeth Warren which is why she shifted said I'm not claiming that I'm Native American anymore but I'm a kind of Native American so give me a million dollars again I call on the Trump administration I callin president from personally signed a nine hundred dollar check to Elizabeth Warren's charity of choice because she is 1/1000 24th Native American maybe he should pay her one one one thousand twenty fourth of a million dollars that is the amount to which she is owed so President Trump was asked about this yesterday and he basically just missed all of it who cares I think you better read it again I hope she's running for president because I think she'd be very easy I hope that she is running I do not think she'd be difficult at all she'll destroy the country she'll make our country into Venezuela with that being said I don't want to say bad things about it because I hope she would be one of the people that would get through the process gonna be a long process with a Democrat okay so President Trump he's eager to go after Elizabeth Warren again I still think we need the image of him with a Publishers Clearing House sighs check handing it sista to to Elizabeth Warren in order to basically have that image linked with Elizabeth Warren forever unfortunately it seems like he's swiveled and he's less interested in whether Elizabeth Warren has a relationship with Tonto and more interested in whether stormy Daniels is in fact silver has another way well but I want to talk a little bit more about why it's important for Elizabeth Warren to have maintained her native-american ancestry point what made her think she could get away with this so let's talk about that here's the thing there's a story that came out September 1st of this year in the Boston Globe and it discussed a serious issue for Elizabeth Warren was senator Warren actually a professor at Harvard Law because she claimed Native American ancestry in other words was she granted special status that sort of gave her in an upper hand when it came to her job at University of Pennsylvania or at Harvard Law School well this long article from the Boston Globe in depth research found that folks at Harvard said that her Native American claims had nothing to do with any of that that her Native American claims had nothing to do with her actual ability to be granted a professorship at Harvard Law School they interviewed some like 31 professors many of whom were on the admissions committee someone whom I know people like Charles freed who I had four contracts he said no when we hired her it had nothing to do with her claiming Native American ancestry in fact we didn't even know that at the time we assumed she was white and the internal documents suggested that University of Pennsylvania treated her as a white person and so did Harvard Law School until it became beneficial for them to claim that she was of minority heritage for purposes of their diversity curriculum right they had to claim that they had a certain number of diverse professors and so they sort of faked it and said that she was Native American but that doesn't mean she got her job based on Native American Native American claims what so with that said why didn't Elizabeth Warren a month and a half ago simply say look I was told by my family members that I had Cherokee ancestry my mom used to tell me that my uncles and aunts used to tell me that and because of that I simply assumed that they all read I was going to assume that my relatives were lying to me those were the stories that I was told growing up I guess that was wrong and so I never should have done any of that stuff but it didn't have any impact on my actual career trajectory my career trajectory was gonna be great no matter what and had nothing to do with those claims so I apologize to Native Americans for having taken seriously the stories of my family without checking them but with that said to claim that I was a beneficiary of some sort of affirmative action is simply untrue but why didn't she do that well there are two reasons she didn't do that and both of them are telling reason number one she figured that she could get away with pretty much anything because the media would cover for her which the media did yesterday there were headlines in the Daily Beast's saying Elizabeth Warren proves Native American ancestry there's a headline over at CNN Elizabeth Warren provides solid evidence of Native American ancestry so she legitimately threw out a study that showed she was not Native American and counted on the media to say that the study showed she was actually Native American and the media complied for the first 12 hours and then it all began to fall apart because people can read and we don't live in a world where there are only three networks and three major newspapers anymore we live in a world where people can fact check stuff and that meant that her narrative began to collapse in on her so she thought she could get away with it because the media would cover for her and why not why wouldn't you think that I mean the media have covered from the fact that beta will work in Texas who is being treated as an Obama esque kennedy-esque new young figure that that guy was involved in a DUI when he was 26 that involved him crossing over a median line smashing a truck and then trying to flee from the scene and they're still touting him as the big new next democratic thing now listen I'm somebody who's had my license suspended for driving too fast I'm obvious about that I was not driving drunk and I didn't crash into anybody it was on an empty freeway bado O'Rourke was driving drunk and hit a guy and then tried to flee the scene while he was drunk and the media have basically said that's a big nothing this is the same media that said that george w bush's DUI back in the 1970s should have qualified him in 2000 from running for the presidency like two weeks before the election so Elizabeth Warren had good cause to think that the media were going to cover for her no matter what if the media covered Democrats the way they cover Republicans half of the candidates for Congress in this election cycle would be toast they would be finished if Bob Menendez in New Jersey would be done he'd be he honestly he'd be gone Claire McCaskill in Missouri would be done Kristin's cinema in Arizona would be just toast but they are not because Elizabeth Warren like every other Democrat knows that there is a grace a sort of buffer zone that is established for Democratic candidates and so she can simply claim Native American ancestry without any proof and the media will continue to cover for her as much as humanly possible right and they they will just continue to cover for her endlessly that's the reason number one that Elizabeth Warren felt comfortable releasing a study that actually contradicted her main narrative line then there is reason number two and this one goes a little bit deeper for the Democrats so reason number two we'll get to in just one second first let's talk about how you manage your money okay you need to outsmart average you need be better than the average investor the smart way to manage your money is the folks

the second reason that Elizabeth Warren didn't just come out months ago and say listen my family got the story wrong you know we're I shouldn't have said all that stuff but I trusted my family my bad had no impact on my career why didn't you just say that the second reason is because identity politics identity politics is all that matters the left an Elizabeth Warren knows this she knows that in a battle between Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris she comes up short in the minority category folks in the Democratic Party have decided that all that matters in the end is intersectionality how many victim groups you belong to Elizabeth Warren only belongs to one purported victim group she's a white woman and white women are under a pretty significant attack by the left right now there was an article we read last week on this program an op-ed in the New York Times talking about how white women were the serious problem in the United States Elizabeth Warren is a white woman she has no intersectional advantage over cory booker over Kamala Harris over to vatra k claiming minority status allows her to say that she is part of the victimized minority in the United States even though she's led a pretty easy life it wasn't with Warren went to Rutgers law school and then she became a a lawyer and then she became a law professor at University of Texas at Austin then University of Pennsylvania then Harvard Law School she flipped some houses she's made some money elizabeth warren is not a person who has endured tremendous suffering at the hands of the evil american patriarchy and hierarchy she has to come up with some story of victimhood and the easiest way to do that is to try and connect to your relatives it's the same routine that Hillary Clinton did she used to talk about her parents all the time and how her parents suffered a lot her mom particularly was was trod upon as a woman in the United States because Elizabeth because it turns out Hillary didn't have a good victimization story in the Democratic Party you need a victimization story in order so that you can try to lead the charge on behalf of all the victim groups elizabeth warren knew that she needed to lead that charge but she could only do that if she identified as some form of minority and the way that she did that is by saying that she had Native American ancestry and what group and has been more put-upon than Native Americans and so she wouldn't let it go she wouldn't let it go now it's backfired on her because you can imagine how these Democratic debates are gonna go you're gonna see people like Kamala Harris turn to a turn to Elizabeth Warren you see Deval Patrick cory booker turns to Elizabeth Warren and suggests that Elizabeth Warren basically traded on fake minority heritage in order to try and score points with the minority base it's gonna hurt her pretty badly so Elizabeth Warren actually damaged herself pretty significantly but that was basically inevitable because she was stuck between a rock and a hard place she's just a white woman running in a party that doesn't care about white woman and thinks that white women are part of the patriarchy and she also can't claim minority status cuz if she does she's lying so Elizabeth Warren shot herself in the foot in a pretty significant way here and I'm not sure that she recovers because honesty was not a priority if she had simply been honest about all this stuff everything would have been fine she wasn't and so things went to hell in a handbasket for her meanwhile she's not the only Democrat in turmoil as a story out today President Trump has raised all ready for his reelection ancestry his ancestry his reelection campaign 100 million dollars in fundraising for his reelection it's only 2018 according to Greenwich Times the Greenwich Times President Trump has topped 100 million dollars in fundraising for his 20/20 re-election bid an enormous haul for a president barely two years into his first term according to new figures reported by his 2020 campaign Trump pulled in more than 18 million dollars last quarter through his campaign committee and two joint fundraising committees with the RNC for a total of at least 106 million since January 17 2017 according to his campaign and federal filings so that's bad news for Democrats who thought that Trump would have collapsed at this point that he would have destroyed himself by this point Trump can't destroy himself because nothing you do can destroy a man who has no character hey president Trump is not a man of rich character listen I like a lot of what he does politically but this is a guy who goes on Twitter and calls former lovers he had sex with while he was married horseface okay so it's gonna be kind of difficult to destroy that cut and it turns out that most folks who want to see his priorities put in place don't care too much about his character we've established that character in American politics is no longer a major concern obviously and so Trump can raise as much money as he wants meanwhile Democrats and Senate races across the country are having trouble to peyto O'Rourke acting on the best ideals of his democratic spread the wealth around campaign he announced on Monday he is not going to share any of his 38 million dollar war chest even though Democratic bosses want the cash for more competitive states so beta O'Rourke is going to lose to Ted Cruz in Texas in the Senate race latest polls have him down almost double digits after the media had been fawning over him the same way they fawned over Wendy Davis the former state senator in Texas who then lost by something like 20 points to Greg Abbott well now they are for a governor in Texas they're doing the same thing with beta O'Rourke beta won't share the money why would he spread the wealth around am I so greedy they don't work it's like a Republican or something the Texas Democrat told reporters after a campaign rally he will not spare any expense in his own race he plans to leave all the money he has raised out on the field ahead of Election Day O'Rourke raised from July to September 38 point 1 million dollars he says that he is going to he is not going to contribute any of that money to other candidates which is kind of amazing because honestly if he wants to ensure his future in the Democratic Party he really should become a patron of the Arts right he should be taking that money and distributing it to more hotly contested races he's not going to do any of that so that's a bad story for Democrats meaning meanwhile Claire McCaskill is running a very tight race in Missouri and James O'Keefe the enemy undercover journalist he's gonna shock journalists over at project Veritas he's done some good work before he sends his workers in T sent some of his folks in to Claire McCaskill's office and he got Claire McCaskill's people to acknowledge that she is campaigning far to the right of where she actually isn't on the issues here's some of what that sounded like I can tell them because she does support a semi-automatic firearm because I won't say someone shouldn't say I think semi-automatic Ana semi-automatic rifle bit okay more so much it's important but she doesn't like openly go out and support groups like moms to main action we're just like other groups that are like related to that because that couldn't hurt like people her like her ability to get elected because people like see that and they're just like well I don't want to support her even though like they say for the same policies um okay so she's basically been fibbing about her own positions so Claire McCaskill is in trouble in Missouri Cristen cinema just three weeks ago was leading martha mcsalley in the Arizona Senate race and now it turns out that all of her past has come out and Cristen cinema is a nutcase so Kyrsten Sinema is the Democratic nominee in Arizona according to the Washington Examiner she apparently takes sorcery very seriously emails obtained by The Washington Examiner show cinema was invited to a prominent coven of feminist witches in Arizona it was called Pagan cluster to celebrate International Women's Day and to protest the war in March of 2003 code pink protesters were pink obviously enough and the women in black or black but cinema encouraged the witches to wear colorful clothing and come ready to dance twirl and stay in touch with your inner creativity and with the earth the cinema campaign would not say why she invited the witches or clarify why she thought members of the occult deserved a seat at the table during discussions concerning war and peace the witches in question it should be noted claimed to practice only nonviolent magic for the About section on their web page there is a peaceful and democratic kind of sorcery the Pagan cluster focuses on sharing spiritual insights and participating in direct democracy their visions are decidedly liberal many of their coven quote have roots in the reclaiming tradition of feminist witchcraft mmm-hmm cinema also went to an anti-war rally with pagans later that year and apparently she talked about singing and spiraling in the pagans circle only five rows from the police line and then the police arrested everybody so Kyrsten Sinema yeah just doing yeoman's work on behalf of her own campaign also it turns out she organized for the Arizona Alliance for peace and justice in one email she urged supporters of the AAA PJ to dilute to deluge the phone lines of a radio show hosted by an unapologetic unconditional supporter of Israeli policy so Kyrsten Sinema is basically toast in that Senate race as well Democrats radicalism is the major issue here and all they have is President Trump which is why it's not good that the President of the United States goes around calling women whores face I mean really this will get to more of that in just one second the Democratic response to all of this plus a kind of shocking story Carter Paige is now suing the folks over at fusion GPS we'll get to all of that in just second first I need to talk to you about something that has really made my back feel better so I work out a lot I mean

chocolate willing we have a bunch that are just amazing coming out go check that out leave us a 5 star review on iTunes if you know what's good for you go check that out right now we are the largest fastest-growing conservative podcast in the nation so with all of this said with all of this said the economy continues to do well this was such a good news cycle it really was it was such a good news cycle the economy was doing great the new jobs numbers are just terrific not only that we have the highest federal collection of income taxes in history in 2018 though the if you just look at the numbers we are collecting more income taxes than ever before even though we have lower income tax rates than we did last year why because supply-side economics works when the economy grows then the government actually takes in more taxes than if the economy is stagnant and we have higher tax rates the economy has been going great guns under President Trump we'll get to the deficit in a second which is not quite as good but this is a very good news cycle for President Trump so in the last three weeks he got a Supreme Court justice and watch the left kill themselves over Cavanaugh he got Elizabeth Warren in one of the great unforced political blunders of my lifetime releasing a report saying she was Native American when she is less she is less Indian than actual people from India like actual people from India have more Native American blood than Elizabeth Warren does it's an amazing thing and with that said president Trump decides to step on himself with stormy Daniels and calling people horseface this is the only line of attack that Democrats have is just attacks on President Trump and so this is what they're ratcheting up Nancy Pelosi who's looking at a bad Senate map right now she's trying to suggest that President Trump is now in the pay of the Saudis that the reason that President Trump hasn't been harsher on the Saudi government with regard to their murder of Jamal khashoggi their alleged murder of Jamal Kannagi an American resident who was a critic of the Saudi regime and also a fan of the Muslim Brotherhood she says the reason Trump hasn't been harsher is cuz maybe he's being paid off by the Saudis in terms of Saudi Arabia I think that was I've always wondered why he went there as the first country to visit outside of the United States of course as president of the United States all the other presidents back to Ronald Reagan went to to Canada or to one to Mexico George W Bush so in our hemisphere were there many friends and allies we could have gone to so there was I was always suspicious that there was some kind of a financial transaction involved there whether for his business says whatever good luck with this line of attack it's it's pretty crazy that the that Democrats think the only way that they're gonna be able to win elections is by simply throwing out unverified and unverifiable information like this but it shows how desperate they are which is why again unforced errors are the biggest problem for the Trump administration they've always been the biggest problem for the Trump administration here's here's I think the rule in American politics right now whoever shuts up first wins really because this is just it's the worst tennis match ever right if you if you watch tennis players you very often you will see that sometimes the best strategy is just get the ball over the net because sooner or later somebody is gonna smack the ball into the net and then you win basically there's a great line which which comedian is it I think it's Mitch Hedberg is that that the name of the comedian and so he has a line he says no matter how good the problem I have with tennis is no matter how good I get I'm never better than the wall well that's that's essentially what's happening in American politics right now if you are the wall you win if you are the wall you wouldn't that's all if you are the person who just sits there and lets the other side bang its head against you you win if you're the person who commits unforced errors you lose the Democrats have been committing unforced error after unforced error here and that's why it would be great if the president would just stop but again I guess we're gonna have an entire news cycle now about horseface doesn't hurt Trump in any serious way not really but it does jazz up the Democrats again it reminds them how much they hate President Trump when he goes away it's hard for them to talk about this as much nobody cares but with that said Trump Trump gun Trump that's just the way that it goes now the Trump also comes along with the benefit of Trump right there's always a good side to what Trump is and a bad side to what Trump is so the same guy who calls his former lovers horseface is the same fellow who's actually trying to stop these immigrant caravans that have been traveling from places like Honduras so President Trump on Tuesday threatened to withdraw funding an aide from Honduras if it does not stop a caravan of people that head is heading to the United States Trump said the United States has strongly informed the presidents of Honduras that if the large caravan of people heading to the US has not stopped and brought back to Honduras no more money or aid will be given to Honduras effective immediately up to three thousand migrants cross from Honduras into Guatemala on on a trek northward after a standoff with police in riot gear and warnings from Washington the migrants should not try to enter the United States illegally and then the crowd more than doubled in size and they do this they do this March every year where people are sent up from Latin America through Central America and to the United States border Trump threatenings withdraw aid from countries that don't stop this seems not completely unreasonable to me with that said he should be threatening aid to Saudi Arabia as well based on their human rights violations and frankly any country that commits human rights violations in the way that Saudi Arabia has I'm not sure why we should be funding those countries especially when we have the capacity to do much more direct damage to Iran through sanctions and through military know-how then the Saudis do I mean the Saudis basically are there because we let them be there in any case the the other big story of the day is that Carter page is now suing the DNC so according to the Daily Caller former Trump campaign associate Carter page has filed a defamation lawsuit Monday against the DNC and its law firm which commissioned the infamous steel dossier page filed the suit in federal court in Oklahoma against the DNC the law firm Perkins Coie and two of its partners mark Elias and Michael Sussman now you remember what happened with cutter Page the accusation from the Republicans that Carter page was a low-level foreign policy aide for President Trump was basically hamstrung by the DNC he was targeted for destruction by the DNC working hand in glove with law enforcement members of the FBI and the Obama administration the goal being to get a FISA warrant against him and that would somehow damage the Trump campaign that's basically the accusation and to to support that accusation there are a couple of pieces of evidence one Carter page still has not been arrested for all the attempts to get Carter page nobody's actually gotten Carter page on anything he's not been arrested he's not been tried no charges have been brought against him so maybe this was all a setup point number two is that there are heavy ties between the the fusion GPS firm that was hired by the DNC to do opposition research which included some kind of page material in the steel dossier and the DNC and the FBI and those ties have been revealed over time and they are bothersome they're quite bothersome they're quite troubling page is he filed that lawsuit and Perkins Coie is the firm that hired fusion gps the opposition researcher than stated Donald Trump's links to Russia Elias who's one of the lawyers over at Perkins Coie was Perkin quite main contact to fusion GPS it was founded by three former Wall Street Journal reporters as part of its 1 million dollar project fusion GPS hired Christopher Steele to conduct the investigation now what's fascinating about this lawsuit is that lawsuits sometimes are designed for victory and sometimes lawsuits are designed for discovery in other words in the process of doing a lawsuit you can ask bunch a lot of questions to the person that you are suing and they are forced to give up documents on those topics so Carter pager obviously wants to dig deep into what the DNC was doing with Perkins Coie what they were doing with fusion GPS it also opens him up to discovery as well so in response you could see the DNC asking for materials on Carter pages relationship with the Trump administration in Russia for Carter page to launch the loss unless it's really ill founded suggests that Carter page doesn't have a lot to hide but he thinks the DNC does have a lot to hide that's damaging stuff obviously before the DNC if that is true again Carter page has been sort of the the main linchpin of a lot of Democratic efforts to paint collusion between Donald Trump and the Russian government in 2016 and so far no hard evidence has been brought out to prove any of that stuff to prove any of that stuff so that is a story that we're gonna watch as it unfolds now in other news that I think is not as good the budget deficit is the highest that it's been in years and I hear I have to ding Republicans so we've heard for a lot of years that Republicans care about budget deficits we kept hearing that Barack Obama was blowing out the debt which he was it's up to about 21 trillion dollars now it's unsustainable and that's only the debt that we know about basically there's bunch of unfunded liabilities that put our actual total debt at many multiples of 20 trillion dollars unfunded liabilities for which we'll have to raise taxes or blow out inflation but the US budget deficit is expanding Republicans have not been fiscally responsible President Trump has not been fiscally responsible he's been around taxes he's been good on regulations he's been very very very bad on spending according to CNBC the US federal budget deficit rose in fiscal year 2018 to the highest level in six years as spending climbed the Trump administration said Monday the deficit jumped 779 billion 113 billion dollars or 17% higher than the previous fiscal period according to a statement from Treasury secretary Steve minuchin it's larger than any years since 2012 when it topped one trillion dollars the budget shortfall rose to three point nine percent of u.s. gross domestic product that despite the fact we are now taking in more money than any time in American history from income tax the problem we have in this country is not a taxing problem it is a spending problem and government is addicted to spending and nobody's gonna stop it because no one has an interest in actually stopping the spending Americans like the idea of spending less until you actually ask them what sorts of programs they wish to see cut at which point they get quite skittish very very skittish about doing any sorts of real cuts at all federal revenues rose slightly by fourteen billion dollars after Republicans chopped tax rates for corporations and individuals outlays climbed by one hundred and twenty seven billion dollars including a spike in defense spending as well as increases for Medicaid Social Security and disaster relief so that is not exactly fiscal discipline we have no party in the United States that stands for fiscal discipline that needs to stop this is bad whether it is Republicans or whether it is Democrats it is just bad stuff all the way around there's nothing good happening here we need to get that under control if President Trump wants to win a second term I would suggest that we start talking in serious fashion about those deficits at some point that the the burden comes due okay time for a few things that I like and then we will do some things that I hate so things that I like today mark Levins dad writes books and he wrote a children's book that's really great I bought it for my kids and it's great it reminds kids that the police can actually be your friends despite all of the coverage by the by the media policemen are generally doing a great job and I say that in spite of the fact that there are some policemen who are doof's right I told you a story last week about a doof policeman who pulled us over while we were in a police escort in Detroit but the police overall do a fantastic job they do a fantastic job keeping us safe and appreciating the members of our police is deeply necessary Jack Levin the father of Mark Levin wrote this and Mark I think does something really sweet here by by pushing his dad's books III think that that's just a great thing that mark does I'm a big Mark Levin fan and supporter you should check it out our police by Jack Levin go check that out right now ok other things that I like so this is pretty funny last week there was a song that I played on the show by a young woman of the left her name was Lindsay lab Stewart it was a feminist song in which she claims that women can't do anything in the United States but men can do anything that they want and shouldn't be scared of false rape accusations well that has prompted a conservative blogger named Kylie simple to write and perform her own version of the song I don't know so just like me so there's a better message it's a better message then women are deeply victimized every single day in the United States and men shouldn't worry about their victimization at the hands of women who lie sometimes or who rinse remember sometimes this is a much better message because turns out you know it's a bad message a better message than the Democratic message the Left message they are not a victim and that you're in control of your own life in a free country there's a fascinating study we talked about it last week this hidden tribe study was the one that said 80% of Americans hate political correctness that same study showed a massive gap between the left and the right on one particular issue whether people can succeed on their own merits in the United States 86 percent of people call themselves progressive said that you are not free to succeed on your own merits in the United States only 2% of people on the right thought that you're not able to succeed on your own merits in the United States which one do you think is a more inspiring message likely to lead to the success of individuals certainly the conservative message okay time for a couple of things that I hate so alec baldwin now apparently has a talkshow I guess on ABC which is pretty incredible the man just keeps failing up right he was on MSNBC he lost his talk show on MSNBC that couldn't support ratings but they thought okay well put him on ABC and that will fix things well one of the things that he said over the past week is that he's horrified President Trump as president which is kind of amazing coming from a guy who left a message on his daughter's answering machine talking about how she was a little pig and how terrible she is again I understand people having character quibbles with the presidents of the United States and serious character questions about the presidents of the United States I certainly do but I do not understand people in Hollywood suddenly finding their moral scruples when it comes to presidents after they spent years preparing the way playing fluffer for Bill Clinton but here is Alec Baldwin I mean to me every day I wake up I still am horrified and I feel like I'm in some dream that Trump is the President of the United States I can't even move can't even say it okay well the screen is amazing when you shut that idiot up this is amazing according to Nielsen the premiere is on ABC right not on it not on MSNBC or a cable network on ABC the premiere of his ABC talk show brought in 2.2 million total viewers with an anaemic 0.4 rating and the advertiser coveted 18 to 49 demographic okay let me give you a by way of contrast hey by way of contrast he's on ABC a network my Fox Sunday show okay my Fox election special last week it elite before son dicks I think the ratings aren't out yet the week before Sunday it brought in 1.8 million I nearly matched his ratings on Fox News on a Sunday night during Sunday Night Football hey he's on ABC and he couldn't get any ratings he keeps failing up he keeps failing up you know there's a market for it's it's really amazing when you think about it there is not a single Trump forget Trump supporting Trump curious you know there's not even anybody who's mildly positive toward Trump even when he does good things on network TV and yet they keep going back to the same old horses who keep falling down dead in the ratings and so Alec Baldwin keeps getting jobs even though the guy can't draw flies except if he's on another show like 30 rock or SNL pretty amazing all of this works okay well we will be back here tomorrow with all of the latest i'm ben shapiro this
