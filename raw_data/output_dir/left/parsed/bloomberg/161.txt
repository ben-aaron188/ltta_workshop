MISS?"
SCARLET: THE FED FACES TO
SEPARATE PATHS.
WE HAVE THE CHART THAT EXPLAINS
THEIR APPROACH.
JOE: HOW MUCH LONGER CAN THE
HOUSING RUN CONTINUE?
MATT: IS CLIMATE CHANGE
MAGNIFYING THE DANGERS FOR
HOUSING.
36 U.S. CITIES COULD BE
COMPLETELY LOST.
SCARLET: WE BEGIN WITH MARKET
MINUTES.
AND X IS SETTING RECORD HIGHS,
CLOSING NEARLY.
JANET YELLEN MAY OR MAY NOT GIVE
AN INDICATION OF WHAT THE FED
SEES AS THE NEXT RATE MOVE.
JOE: VERY QUIET MARKET AHEAD OF
THAT MEETING.
UTILITIES AND STAPLES LAGGING ON
THE WAY UP TODAY.
MATT: TAKE A LOOK AT THE WINNERS
AND LOSERS FOR THE DAY.
BEST BUY, MASSIVE WINNER.
I BELIEVE IT IS UP $6.43.
SCARLET: UP 20%.
TOLL BROTHERS ALSO GAINING AFTER

NOW IT IS 600 FOR A PAIR.
SCARLET: YOU NEED A PAIR

MATT: $1200 IS THE LEAST YOU CAN
SPEND IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE
NEW ALLERGIES.
JOE: I HAVE BEEN DEADLY ALLERGIC
TO PEANUTS MY WHOLE LIFE.
LOOKING AT GOVERNMENT BOND

YOUR EYE ON IS PORTUGAL.

THAT IS PRETTY JUICY.
THERE ARE ONGOING CONCERNS ABOUT
A POTENTIAL DOWNGRADE, SO KEEP
AN EYE ON THOSE YIELDS.
SCARLET: A BIG MOVER TODAY WAS
THE SOUTH AFRICA RAND.
THERE IS A LOCAL NEWS REPORT
THAT A POLICE UNIT ORDERED THE
FINANCE MINISTER TO REPORT TO
ITS OFFICES.
THIS REPORT RAISE CONCERNS OF A
RIFT BETWEEN THE FINANCE
MINISTER AND PRESIDENT JACOB

MATT: WE HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT
THIS FOR A WHILE.
SCARLET: GORDON HAVE COMMITTED

OFF AND DEBT REDUCTION.
JOE: CHECK OUT OIL.
WE KEEP GETTING THESE HEADLINES.
MAYBE THE PRODUCERS WILL STEP IN
AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT
OVERPRODUCTION.
PERHAPS SOMETHING WITH IRAN THIS

I'M LOOKING AT TREASURIES.
WHO WANTS TO GET AHEAD OF JANET
YELLEN SPEECH?
VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT BEFORE THE

IN JULY, 31 BASIS POINTS.
IN JUNE, 41 BASIS POINTS.
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO JUNE FOR
A SMALLER TRADING RANGE IN 2006.
MATT: 32 CONSECUTIVE DAYS
WITHOUT A BIG SWING.
JOE: IT'S QUIET.
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE U.K.
IT HAS BEEN TWO MONTHS SINCE
THAT VOTE.
WE STILL HAVE NOT SEEN THE
ECONOMY FALL.
SOME DATA IS NOT THAT BAD.
THE BLUE LINE ON THIS CHART IS
THE ECONOMIC SURPRISE INDEX FOR
THE U.K.
THAT COULD BE A FUNCTION OF THE
DATA HOLDING STEADY, BUT DATA
WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED.
WHY DO MANUFACTURER EXPORT
ORDERS PICK UP?
THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE WEEK POUND
-- WEAK POUND.
MATT: IT WASN'T AN APOCALYPSE.
AT LEAST NOT YET.
JOE: THERE WILL BE ONE DAY.
MATT: I'M HAVING A LOOK AT
STOCKS.
WHAT IT SHOWS YOU IS THAT U.S.
STOCKS, THE WHITE LINE -- SORRY,
THE BLUE LINE TRACK VERY CLOSELY
GLOBAL TECH STOCKS, THE WHITE
LINE.
THE POINT IS THAT THE PINK LINE,
WHICH IS ALL GLOBAL STOCKS,
DOESN'T TRACK EITHER ONE.
U.S. STOCKS ARE TRACKING TECH
STOCKS BETTER THAN GLOBAL STOCKS
ARE TRACKING TECH STOCKS.
JOE: HERE WITH US TO DISCUSS THE
STOCK MARKET AND TODAY'S ACTION
IS OLIVER RENICK.
OLIVER: I THINK THE CHART IS
PRETTY INTERESTING.
AS THE FIRST TIME I AM SEEING
IT.
THERE IS A LOT TO BE SAID ABOUT
TECH COMPANIES RIGHT NOW.
MATT: THIS CHART COMES FROM
CHARLES SCHWAB POSTED IN THE
BLOG EARLIER.
CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE.
OLIVER: LOOKING AT TECH STOCKS,
A LOT OF INTERESTING STUFF.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT VALUATIONS, THE
WAITING IN TECH STOCKS,
COMPRISING 21% OF THE BENCHMARK.
THAT NUMBER DOES NOT VACILLATE A
HUGE AMOUNT.
SINCE THE RUN UP, THEY ARE 21%
OF THE INDEX, SO THERE ARE
STARTING TO BE SOME QUESTIONS.
THEY ARE CALLING INTO QUESTION
SOME OF THE EARNINGS AND
VALUATIONS.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE EARNINGS
BACKDROP, IT IS VERY STRONG.
JOE: ONE OF THE THEMES OF THE
MARKET IS HOW LITTLE VOLATILITY
THERE IS.
ONE CHART WE HAVE HERE, S&P 500
AND IMPLIED CORRELATIONS AT
THEIR LOWEST LEVEL SINCE BREXIT.
>> THIS IS A BLOOMBERG FUNCTION
EVERYONE SHOULD USE.
YOU CAN TRACK THIS.
IF YOU ARE OUT THERE TRYING TO
MAKE MONEY IN STOCKS, THIS IS AS
IMPORTANT AS ANY INDICATOR THAT
THERE IS.
IT HAS NOT GONE BACK UP.
THE PROBLEM IS WHETHER INVESTORS
CAN GO IN AND PICK THE RIGHT
STOCKS.
SCARLET: IT'S A CORRELATION
BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT COMPANIES,
NOT ASSET CLASSES?
OLIVER: CORRECT.
JOE: I CHARTED AGAINST THE VIX,
WHEN YOU SEE THE SURGES IN
VOLATILITY, EVERYTHING MOVES
TOGETHER.
ONE VOLATILITY DECLINES, STOCKS
BEHAVE IN THEIR OWN WAYS.
>> STOCKS MIGHT BE MOVING IN
THEIR OWN SEPARATE WAYS, ARE THE
SECTORS MOVING IN THEIR OWN
SEPARATE WAYS, ARE THE FACTORS
MOVING SEPARATELY?
AT THAT CAN BE A HARDER THING TO
NAVIGATE, ESPECIALLY WITH A
TURNOVER.
SCARLET: YOU SEEN MORE THAN 400
MILLION DOLLARS OF INFLOWS INTO
THE MOMENTUM ETF'S.
IT IS PRETTY SMALL, BUT
EVERYTHING ELSE HAS BEEN
SIGNIFICANT.
>> ONE OF THE BIG STORIES IN THE
EQUITY MARKET IS THE EMERGENCE
OF THIS SMART DATA TYPES TRAGEDY
, PASSIVE AND ACTIVE AT THE SAME
TIME, CAPITALIZING NOT ON A
SECTOR OR STYLE OR FACTOR,
MOMENTUM IS ONE OF THOSE
FACTORS.
WE KNOW WHICH SECTORS HAVE BEEN
DOING WELL, DEFENSIVE,
UTILITIES, CONSUMER STAPLES.
WHAT THOSE FLOWS ARE TELLING YOU
IS THAT THE MOMENTUM STOCKS ARE
THOSE DEFENSIVE TYPE COMPANIES
WITH THE DIVIDENDS.
PEOPLE ARE NOT ONLY SEEING GAINS
IN THE SECTORS, BUT PILING MORE
MONEY INTO IT.
SCARLET: SPEAKING OF THE
DIFFERENT SECTORS.
THIS IS THE RELATIVE ROTATION
GRAPH.
 SPEAKING OF THE
DIFFERENT SECTORS.
WITHIN THE LEADING SECTORS,
TECHNOLOGY AT THE TOP, FOLLOWED
BY HEALTH CARE.
MAYBE CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY
MOVING UP, BUT A LOT OF
DEFENSIVE PLAYS.
>> I LIKE THIS FUNCTION.
IT IS THE JACKSON POLLOCK OF
MARKET MOVES.
EVERYTHING HAS ITS OWN STORY.
TECH IS A SHIFT TOWARD CYCLICAL
COMPANIES.
SOME OF THESE ECONOMIC ORIENTED
COMPANIES WILL DO BETTER.
AT THE SAME TIME, SPECIFIC
STORIES GOING ON WITH CONSUMER
DISCRETIONARY.
THAT'S ONE OF THE FEW GROUPS
WHERE EARNINGS HAS BEEN DOING
WELL.
AS WE PIVOT BACK TOWARDS
POSITIVE EARNINGS, THAT CAN
PROVIDE LIFT TO THE MARKET.
YOU WILL SEE SOME OF THE SECTORS
DO WELL.
>> JOE POINTED THIS OUT TO ME
EARLIER.
YOU MENTIONED PASSIVE INVESTING.
SOMEONE AT BERNSTEIN PUT OUT A
NOTE THAT PASSIVE INVESTMENT IS
WORSE FOR SOCIETY THAN MARXISM.
>> THERE IS A LOT OF VOCAL
DEBATE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE
ISSUE, HOW LONG CAN SMART DATA
BE SMART DATA?
-- SMART BETA BE SMART BETA?
>> IF YOU ARE AN ACTIVE MANAGER
WHO HAS TO JUSTIFY YOUR FEES,
THEN PASSIVE INVESTING MIGHT NOT
BE THE BEST THING FOR YOU.
JOE: OLIVER RENICK, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
SCARLET: WE WILL BE BACK WITH
MUCH MORE.

FROM ZILLOW, RISING SEA LEVELS
COULD AFFECT 6% OF THE HOUSING
STOCK.
NATIONWIDE, ALMOST ONE POINT 9
MILLION HOMES -- ONE POINT 9
MILLION HOMES ARE AT RISK OF
BEING UNDERWATER.
JOINING ME NOW IS THE CHIEF
ECONOMIST FROM ZILLOW.
ABSOLUTELY EYE-POPPING NUMBERS.
IS ANYONE PREPARED FOR THE
ECONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHICAL DAMAGE
THAT RISING SEA LEVELS COULD
HAVE ON THE HOUSING MARKET?
>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.
I DON'T THINK WE ARE AT THAT
POINT YET, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT
THE HORIZON IS NOT 100 YEARS
INTO THE FUTURE.
SCARLET: YOU WERE PROJECTING OUT
90 YEARS, BUT WHAT HAVE YOU
FOUND ABOUT THE PACE OF THE
RISING SEA LEVEL OVER THE LAST
5-10 YEARS?
>> IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT
SCIENTISTS HAVE RELEASED IN
TERMS OF HOW FAST SEA LEVELS ARE
SLATED TO RISE, IT SEEMS LIKE A
FAIRLY GOOD ESTIMATE.
IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT 10 YEARS OR
20 YEARS INTO THE FUTURE, SEA
LEVELS WILL PERHAPS ONLY RISE BY
A FOOT, MAYBE TWO FEET IN SOME
AREAS THAT ARE LOWER.
IT IS SUCH A SHORT TIME HORIZON
THERE THAT THE REAL IMPACT WILL
COME IN THE FUTURE.
GIVEN THAT IT IS SUCH A LONG
HORIZON, I DON'T THINK PEOPLE
ARE YET PREPARED FOR HOW MUCH
DAMAGE WATER WILL CAUSE TO
COMMUNITIES RIGHT BY THE OCEAN
AND HOW MUCH MONEY WILL BE LOST
IN ALL OF THIS, ESPECIALLY GIVEN
THAT OUR ESTIMATES ARE
CONSERVATIVE.
WERE LOOKING AT THE CURRENT
HOUSING STOCK IN THE CURRENT
DOLLAR VALUE.
IF YOU THINK ABOUT CONSTRUCTION
INTO THE FUTURE, WE WILL TILT
MORE HOMES AND MORE EXPENSIVE
HOMES, ESPECIALLY ALONG THE
COAST, AND MORE PEOPLE WILL BE
AFFECTED BY THIS.
>> 100 YEARS IS A LONG TIME
HORIZON.
IS IT SAFE TO ASSUME THAT MOTHER
NATURE WILL GIVE US A FEW HINTS?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THE FLOODING IN LOUISIANA RIGHT
NOW IS A REMINDER THAT GLOBAL
WARMING IS HAPPENING.
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT IS ONE OF
THE SIDE EFFECTS AS TEMPERATURES
ARE RISING.
IN THE FUTURE, WE CAN EXPECT
MORE OF THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN.
THERE IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW
MUCH HAVOC RISING WATER LEVEL
CAN CAUSE IN A COMMUNITY, HOW
MANY HOMES AFFECTED, AND HOW
MANY LIVES AFFECTED.
>> WE SHOW THE TOP FIVE CITIES
WITH PROPERTIES MOST AT RISK.
LOUISIANA FLOODS EASILY.
FOR EXAMPLE, NEW YORK, BOSTON,
MIAMI, FORT LAUDERDALE,
HUNTINGTON BEACH ARE ALL ON
HERE.
THESE ARE POPULOUS AREAS WITH
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE PROPERTIES.
YOU DON'T TYPICALLY SEE FLOODS
AFFECTING APARTMENT BUILDINGS IN
NEW YORK CITY.
>> LOUISIANA IS A TOP STATE THAT
WILL BE AFFECTED, BUT OTHER
STATES WILL BE EVEN MORE SO
AFFECTED.
NEW JERSEY, FLORIDA, HAWAII.
IN FLORIDA, ONE OUT OF EIGHT
CITIES WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH
FLOODING, AND 300 CITIES ACROSS
THE U.S. WILL LOSE MORE THAN
HALF OF THEIR HOUSING STOCK TO
RISING SEA LEVELS IN THE FUTURE.
THESE ARE VERY POPULOUS AREAS
THAT WILL BE AFFECTED, THEREFORE
WE WILL ALSO SEE A TRILLION

RAMIFICATIONS WILL THIS HAVE?
FLOOD INSURANCE AS BECOME
SOMETHING MUCH MORE CRITICAL

THAT HOUSING CYCLE HAS A LONG

HOUSED?

TO THAT 800,000.
>> I DON'T THINK THEY WILL RAISE

MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE.
THE GROWTH HAS BEEN SLOW, BUT
STEADY.
TO GET TO THAT 800,000, IT'S NOT
SO MUCH TOLL BROTHERS THAT WE

>> DEMAND IS THERE, SO IT HAS TO
BE SUPPLY.
FOR US TO GET TO 800,000, WE
WILL HAVE TO SEE SIGNIFICANTLY
MORE SUPPLY.

IN HOUSING IS THAT THERE IS SO
MUCH INTEREST IN TOP-TIER
CITIES.

CALIFORNIA, PHOENIX, NEVADA --
THEY HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO

THERE HAS BEEN REAL GROWTH IN
THE SOUTH AND WEST.
THE MIDWEST IS NOT DOING AS WELL
AS THOSE TWO REGIONS.
THE NORTHEAST IS BELOW THE ZERO

ATLANTA HAS MORE LOTS THAN HALF

SOME OF THE INLAND AREAS ARE NOT
THAT RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE.
COMPARED TO THE SOUTH, THEY ARE.

RECOVERY.

MOST WHEN THEY LOOK AT THIS

GOT WRONG WAS THAT THOUGHT IT

I THINK THIS IS WHAT WE HAD
EXPECTED WITH A SLOW STEADY
RECOVERY.
I'M NOT SURE WHAT ELSE PEOPLE
