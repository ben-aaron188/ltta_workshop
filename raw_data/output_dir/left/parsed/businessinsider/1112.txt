Chief Justice Roberts President Carter
President Clinton President Bush
President Obama fellow Americans and
people of the world thank you
we the citizens of America are now
joined in a great national effort to
rebuild our country and restore its
promise for all of our people together
we will determine the course of America
and the world for many many years to
come we will face challenges we will
confront hardships but we will get the
job done every four years we gather on
these steps to carry out the orderly and
peaceful transfer of power and we are
grateful to President Obama and first
lady Michelle Obama for their gracious a
throughout this transition they have
been magnificent thank you today's
ceremony however has very special
meaning because today we are not merely
transferring power from one
administration to another or from one
party to another but we are transferring
power from Washington DC and giving it
back to you
the people
for too long a small group in our
nation's capital has reaped the rewards
of government while the people have
borne the cost Washington flourished but
the people did not share in its wealth
politicians prospered but the jobs left
and the factories closed the
establishment protected itself but not
the citizens of our country their
victories have not been your victories
their triumphs have not been your
triumphs and while they celebrated in
our nation's capital there was little to
celebrate for struggling families all
across our land that all changes
starting right here and right now
because this moment is your moment it
belongs to you
it belongs to everyone gathered here
today and everyone watching all across
America this is your day this is your
celebration and this the United States
of America is your country what truly
matters is not which party controls our
government but whether our government is
controlled by the people January 20th
2017 will be remembered as the day the
people became the rulers of this nation
again the Forgotten men and women of our
country will be forgotten no longer
everyone is listening to you now you
came by the tens of millions to become
part of a historic movement the likes of
which the world has never seen before at
the center of this movement is a crucial
conviction that a nation exists to serve
its citizens Americans want great
schools for their children safe
neighborhoods for their families and
good jobs for themselves these are just
and reasonable demands of righteous
people and a righteous public but for
too many of our citizens a different
reality exists mothers and children
trapped in poverty in our inner cities
rusted out factories scattered like
tombstones across the landscape of our
nation an education system flush with
cash
but which leaves our young and beautiful
students deprived of all knowledge and
the crime and the gangs and the drugs
that have stolen too many lives and
robbed our country of so much unrealized
potential this American carnage stops
right here and stops right now
we are one nation and their pain is our
pain their dreams are our dreams and
their success will be our success we
share one heart one home and one
glorious destiny the oath of office I
take today is an oath of allegiance to
all Americans for many decades we've
enriched foreign industry at the expense
of American industry subsidize the
armies of other countries while allowing
for the very sad depletion of our
military we've defended other nation's
borders while refusing to defend our own
and spent trillions and trillions of
dollars overseas while America's
infrastructure has fallen into disrepair
and decayed we've made other countries
rich while the wealth strength and
confidence of our country has dissipated
over the horizon one by one the factory
shuttered and left our shores with not
even a thought about the millions and
millions of American workers that were
left behind the wealth of our middle
class has been ripped from their homes
and then redistributed all across the
world but that is the past and now we
are looking only to the future
we assembled here today are issuing a
new decree to be heard in every city in
every foreign capital and in every Hall
of power from this day forward a new
vision will govern our land from this
day forward it's going to be only
America first America
first every decision on trade on taxes
on immigration on Foreign Affairs will
be made to benefit American workers and
American families we must protect our
borders from the ravages of other
countries making our products stealing
our companies and destroying our jobs
protection will lead to great prosperity
and strength I will fight for you with
every breath in my body and I will never
ever let you down
America will start winning again winning
like never before we will bring back our
jobs we will bring back our borders we
will bring back our wealth and we will
bring back our dreams we will build new
roads and highways and bridges and
airports and tunnels and railways all
across our wonderful nation we will get
our people off of welfare and back to
work rebuilding our country with
American hands and American labor
we will follow two simple rules by
American and hire American we will seek
friendship and goodwill with the nations
of the world but we do so with the
understanding that it is the right of
all nations to put their own interests
first we do not seek to impose our way
of life on anyone but rather to let it
shine as an example we will shine for
everyone to follow
we will reinforce old alliances and form
new ones and unite the civilized world
against radical Islamic terrorism which
we will eradicate completely from the
face of the earth at the bedrock of our
politics will be a total allegiance to
the United States of America and through
our loyalty to our country we will
rediscover our loyalty to each other
when you open your heart to patriotism
there is no room for prejudice
the Bible tells us how good and pleasant
it is when God's people live together in
unity we must speak our minds openly
debate our disagreements honestly but
always pursue solidarity when America is
united America is totally unstoppable
there should be no fear we are protected
and we will always be protected we will
be protected by the great men and women
of our military and law enforcement and
most importantly we will be protected by
God
finally we must think big and dream even
bigger in America we understand that a
nation is only living as long as it is
striving we will no longer accept
politicians who are all talk and no
action
constantly complaining but never doing
anything about it the time for empty
talk is over now arrives the hour of
action do not allow anyone to tell you
that it cannot be done no challenge can
match the heart and fight and spirit of
America we will not fail our country
will thrive and prosper again we stand
at the birth of a new millenium ready to
unlock the mysteries of space to free
the earth from the miseries of disease
and to harness the energies industries
and technologies of tomorrow a new
national pride will stir ourselves lift
our sights and heal our divisions it's
time to remember that old wisdom our
soldiers will never forget that whether
we are black or brown or white we all
bleed the same red blood of patriots
we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms
and we all salute the same great
American flag and whether a child is
born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or
the windswept plains of Nebraska they
look up at the same night sky they fill
their heart with the same dreams and
they are infused with the breath of life
by the same Almighty Creator so to all
Americans in every city near and far
small and large from Mountain to
mountain from ocean to ocean hear these
words you will never be ignored again
your voice your hopes and your dreams
will define our American destiny and
your courage and goodness and love will
forever guide us along the way together
we will make America strong again we
will make America wealthy again we will
make America proud again we will make
America safe again and yes together we
will make America great again thank you
god bless you and God bless america
