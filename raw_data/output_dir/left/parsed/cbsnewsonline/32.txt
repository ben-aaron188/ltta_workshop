THE POSITION THAT SOME SAY BOTH 
SIDES HAVE ALREADY MADE UP 
THEIR MINDS ABOUT. 
SO, THE PUBLIC MAY NEVER 
ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT IS IN THE 
REPORT. 
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE REPORT 
WAS CONSTRAINED, THE FBI WAS 
CONSTRAINED IN WHO THEY COULD 
TALK TO AND HOW LONG THEY HAD 
TO CONDUCT THE INQUIRY. 
IT'S NOT EVEN REALLY AN 
INVESTIGATION. 
IT IS AN INQUIRY BECAUSE THEY 
HAD NO SUBPOENA POWER AND 
COULDN'T COMPEL ANYBODY TO TALK 
TO THEM. 
ALL THEY COULD DO WAS ASK 
QUESTIONS OF PEOPLE THAT MADE 
THEMSELVES AVAILABLE TO THE FBI 
AND ASKED THEM QUESTIONS 
RELATED ONLY TO THE 
ACCUSATIONS. 
AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND, IT WAS 
ACCUSATIONS OF DR. FORD AGAINST 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
>> YOU DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY 
WHAT THE WHITE HOUSE TOLD THEM. 
IT WAS A LIMITATION AND WE KNOW 
THAT HE DID NOT SPEAK TO BLASEY 
FORD OR KAVANAUGH BUT THEY DID 
SPEAK TO A SECOND ACCUSER, 
DEBORAH RAMIREZ. 
SHE SAID SHE GAVE THEM A LIST OF
PEOPLE TO CORROBORATE HER 
STORY, WHICH IS THAT AT A PARTY 
AT YALE, BRETT KAVANAUGH EXPOSED
HIMSELF TO HER AND SHE SAID NO 
ONE ON HER LIST WAS CONTACTED 
BY THE FBI. 
LIKE I SAID EARLIER, WE KNOW 
THAT 10 PEOPLE WERE CONTACTED 
BY THE FBI AND THE INTERVIEWED 
NINE OF THEM. THIS WAS SUPPOSED 
TO BE THE WEEK TO DO THE 
INVESTIGATION AND IT HAS BEEN 
LESS THAN A WEEK, REALLY, JUST 
A FEW DAYS. 
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE FBI 
COULD REALLY DIG UP. 
SO, HERE WE ARE. 
THERE IS A BOAT PLANNED FOR 
TOMORROW. 
>> TO REITERATE A FINE POINT, 
WHICH IS THAT THE INVESTIGATION 
AND THE INQUIRY, AS I 
UNDERSTAND, WAS SPECIFICALLY 
AROUND THE ALLEGATIONS OF DR. 
FORD AND DEBORAH RAMIREZ, BUT 
YESTERDAY FOR THE FIRST TIME, 
WE HEARD FROM JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
ROOMMATE AT YALE, JAMES ROCHE. 
HE CAME OUT ON RECORD WITH AN 
INTERVIEW WITH CNN AND SAID HE 
HAD KEPT HIS OWN COUNSEL OVER 
THE COURSE OF THE 
INVESTIGATIONS BUT FINALLY CAME 
FORWARD TO SAY THAT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH LIED UNDER OATH ABOUT 
THE DRINKING AND THE MEANING OF 
THE WORDS IN THE YEARBOOK AND 
THAT WAS NOT OF THE -- THAT WAS 
NOT PART OF THE PURVIEW. 
HERE IS SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER 
AND DIANNE FEINSTEIN. 
EXPECT THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER 
WILL MAKE A BRIEF STATEMENT AND 
I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY 
QUESTIONS. 
>> NOR AM I. 
>> AT 9:00 THIS MORNING, MY 
STAFF AND I REVIEWED THE FBI 
REPORT INTO SEXUAL ASSAULT 
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
LET ME BE CLEAR. 
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE DETAIL 
BECAUSE THIS REMAINS A 
CONFIDENTIAL PART OF THE 
BACKGROUND REPORT. 
I HOPE THAT CHANGES ARE MADE 
AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO TALK 
MORE ABOUT WHAT THE FBI DID, 
LATER. 
WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT THE MOST 
NOTABLE PART OF THIS REPORT IS 
WHAT IS NOT IN IT. 
AS WE NOTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE, 
THE FBI DID NOT INTERVIEW BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, NOR DID THE FBI 
INTERVIEW DR. BLASEY FORD. 
WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM NUMEROUS 
PEOPLE OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS 
SEEKING TO PROVIDE INFORMATION 
TO THE FBI, WE HAVE SEEN EVEN 
MORE PRESS REPORTS OF WITNESSES 
WHO WANTED TO SPEAK WITH THE 
FBI BUT WERE NOT INTERVIEWED. 
DEBORAH RAMIREZ'S LAWYER SAID 
HE WAS UNAWARE OF ANY 
CORROBORATING WITNESSES WHO 
WERE INTERVIEWED. 
CANDIDLY, WHAT WE REVIEWED 
TODAY IN A VERY LIMITED TIME, 
AND I WAS THERE AND HAD TO LEAVE
-- THE REPORT IS, IN PART, WITH 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ SOME, 
BUT NOT ALL OF IT. 
IT LOOKS TO BE A PRODUCT OF AN 
INCOMPLETE INVESTIGATION THAT 
WAS LIMITED PERHAPS, BY THE 
WHITE HOUSE. I 
DON'T KNOW. 
BUT, THE WHITE HOUSE CERTAINLY 
BLOCKED ACCESS TO MILLIONS OF 
DOCUMENTS FROM JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S
RECORD. I 
KNOW THAT. 
THEY ENSURED THAT 90% OF HIS 
EMAILS AND MEMOS WEREN'T 
AVAILABLE FOR THE SENATE OR THE 
PUBLIC IN THE HEARINGS. 
IT NOW APPEARS THAT THEY ALSO 
BLOCKED THE FBI FROM DOING ITS 
JOB. 
DEMOCRATS AGREED THAT THE 
INVESTIGATION'S SCOPE SHOULD BE 
LIMITED. 
WE DID NOT AGREE THAT THE WHITE 
HOUSE SHOULD TIE THE HANDS OF 
THE FBI. 
IT'S SIMPLY NOT CREDIBLE TO SAY 
THAT PUBLIC TESTIMONY IN LAST 
WEEK'S HEARING IS A SUBSTITUTE 
FOR INTERVIWS BY FBI AGENTS. 
NOT ONLY DO SENATORS LACK THE 
EXPERTISE OF FBI AGENTS, WE 
WERE ONLY GIVEN FIVE MINUTES TO 
QUESTION JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
SO, IN MY VIEW, FROM WHAT I 
SAW, THE INVESTIGATION WAS VERY 
LIMITED AND IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING, AFTER ALL OF THE 
MEMBERS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY, 
THAT AFTER THEY READ THE 
DOCUMENTS, WE WOULD HAVE AN 
OPPORTUNITY IN PUBLIC TO 
DISCUSS OUR CONCLUSIONS WITH 
THE FINDINGS. 
>> THANK YOU SENATOR FEINSTEIN. 
I HAVE THREE POINTS TO MAKE. 
ONE, WE HAD MANY FEARS THAT 
THIS WAS A VERY LIMITED PROCESS 
THAT WOULD CONSTRAIN THE FBI 
FROM GETTING ALL THE FACTS. 
HAVING RECEIVED A THOROUGH 
úBRI 
THOSE FEARS HAVE BEEN REALIZED. 
SECOND, I DISAGREE. HAVING 
RECEIVED A BRIEFING ON ALL OF 
THE DOCUMENTS, I DISAGREE WITH 
SENATOR GRASSLEY'S STATEMENT 
THAT THERE WAS NO HINT OF 
MISCONDUCT. 
THIRD, WE ARE REITERATING OUR 
CALL, GIVEN HOW LIMITED THIS 
SCOPE WAS, THE LIMITED SCOPE OF 
THE INVESTIGATION, WE ARE 
REITERATING OUR CALL THAT THE 
DOCUMENTS WITH PROPER REDACTION 
BE MADE PUBLIC. 
WHY SHOULDN'T ALL OF AMERICA 
SEE THE FACTS? 
SECOND, WE ARE REITERATING OUR 
CALL TO MAKE THE DIRECTIVE THAT 
THE WHITE HOUSE AND COUNSEL 
MCGHAN MAKE THIS PUBLIC BECAUSE 
WE BELIEVE IT GREATLY 
CONSTRAINED THE INVESTIGATION 
FROM THE GET-GO. 
THE THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE 
DOCUMENT AND THEREFORE 100 
SENATORS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF 
CONSTRAINING THE ABILITY OF ALL 
SENATORS AND THE AMERICAN PUBLIC
TO SEE THE WHOLE TRUTH AND 
NOTHING BUT. 
THANK YOU. 
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU 
DISAGREED WITH SENATOR GRASSLEY 
STATEMENT, SENATOR? 
>>> WE JUST HEARD FROM THE 
DEMOCRAT LEADERSHIP INCLUDING 
SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN, THE 
RANKING MEMBER OF THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE AND CHUCK SCHUMER, 
THE RANKING MINORITY LEADER AND 
CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS IS HERE AT 
HE TABLE WITH US. 
IT'S WHAT WE EXPECTED, I THINK. 
WE EXPECTED THAT THERE WOULD 
NOT BE ENOUGH TIME TO REVIEW 
THE DOCUMENTS AND THAT IS WHAT 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN SAID AND WHAT 
WE HEARD FROM CHUCK SCHUMER IS 
THAT HE FUNDAMENTALLY DISAGREES 
WITH THE STATEMENT THAT SENATOR 
GRASSLEY PUTOUT THAT SAYS THAT 
-- SORRY, THESE UNCORROBORATED 
ACCUSATIONS HAVE BEEN 
UNEQUIVOCALLY AND REPEATEDLY 
REJECTED BY JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 
IT SAYS THAT NEITHER THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE NOR THE FBI 
COULD LOCATE ANY THIRD PARTIES 
WHO CAN ATTEST TO ANY OF THESE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
>> WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT 
NANCY CORDES WAS IN THE ROOM 
AND WE WILL TALK TO HER LATER. 
>> WHAT'S INTERESTING, THEY 
CAN'T SHARE THE DETAILS OF THIS 
CONFIDENTIAL INQUIRY BUT THAT 
IS THE ONLY HINT THAT CHUCK 
SCHUMER SAYS -- AT LEAST WHAT 
HE IS SAYING TO THE PUBLIC -- 
IS THAT WHAT SENATOR GRASSLEY 
SAYS IS PERHAPS NOT EVERYTHING 
THAT PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW. 
>> WE NEED TO STEP BACK AND 
CONSIDER HOW REMARKABLE THIS 
IS. 
IT'S A SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE, A TRADITIONAL 
BIPARTISAN COMMITTEE AND THE 
WAY THEY BEEN OPERATING IN TWO 
LANES IS REMARKABLE GIVEN THE 
SUBSTANCE OF WHAT THEY ARE 
DEALING WITH. 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A LIFETIME 
APPOINTMENT TO THE SUPREME COURT
AND WE WILL SEE THIS ALL DAY 
WITH REPUBLICANS COMING OUT AND 
SAYING ONE THING AND DEMOCRATS 
SAYING ANOTHER. 
RIGHT NOW, WE JUST HEARD THAT 
THE DEMOCRATS ARE VERY 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE SCHOOL. 
>> LEADER McCONNELL IS 
SPEAKING. 
LET'S LISTEN. 
>> WE DEMONSTRATE THE CAPACITY 
FOR SOUND JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT. 
THIS IS A NONPARTISAN TEST THAT 
MY FRIEND, THE DEMOCRATIC 
LEADER, AND OTHERS, USED TO 
CALL THE GOLD STANDARD. JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH PAST THAT WITH FLYING 
COLORS. 
TO BE CLEAR, THIS SEAL OF 
APPROVAL COMES FROM THE ADA 
STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE 
FEDERAL JUDICIARY WITH THE 
INDEPENDENT ENTITY WITHIN THE 
ORGANIZATION. 
EVEN AFTER THE PRESIDENT TRIED 
TO PLAY POLITICS WITH THE 
NOMINATION LAST WEEK, THE 
STANDING COMMITTEE REAFFIRMED 
ITS RATING YET AGAIN. 
UNANIMOUSLY QUALIFIED, JUDGE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
HOW DID WE END UP WHERE WE ARE 
TODAY? 
HOW DID WE GET HERE? 
WE HAVE A CHORUS OF EXPERT 
PRAISE AND PROFESSIONAL 
RESPECT, HOW DID WE GET TO WILD 
TALES OF VIOLENT GANGS, SEXUAL 
ASSAULT. 
BOATS IN RHODE ISLAND HARBORS 
AND THE POSSIBILITY, GET THIS, 
OF AN ARGUMENT IN A COLLEGE 
BAR? 
AN ARGUMENT IN A COLLEGE BAR? 
SEVERAL WEEKS AGO, A 
CONFIDENTIAL ALLEGATION OF 
MISCONDUCT FROM NEARLY FOUR 
YEARS AGO WAS LEAKED TO THE 
PRESS. 
SINCE THEN, OTHER ALLEGATIONS 
HAVE POURED FORTH AND MANY WERE 
JUST PATENTLY RIDICULOUS. 
A FEEDING FRENZY OF RIDICULOUS 
ACCUSATIONS. 
SOME CHEERED ON THE FEEDING 
FRENZY FOR POLITICAL PURPOSE 
LIST -- PURPOSES BUT CHUCK 
GRASSLEY AND HIS STAFF ROLLED 
UP THEIR SLEEVES AND WENT TO 
WORK. 
THEY PROMPTLY INVESTIGATED THE 
ALLEGATIONS THAT MATERIALIZED 
AT THE LAST MINUTE. 
CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY REOPENED THE 
PUBLIC HEARINGS SO DR. FORD AND 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH COULD SPEAK 
DIRECTLY TO THOSE CLAIMS UNDER 
OATH OATH. 
THAT WAS AFTER, BY THE WAY, HE 
OFFERED DR. FOR THE OPTION TO 
TELL HER STORY AT ANY PLACE OF 
HER CHOOSING EITHER HERE OR IN 
CALIFORNIA, EITHER IN PUBLIC OR 
IN PRIVATE AND EITHER WITH 
STAFF OR WITH MEMBERS AND ALL 
ACCORDING TO DR. FORD'S 
TESTIMONY, SEEMINGLY NEVER 
COMMUNICATED TO HER BY HER 
LAWYERS, DESPITE THE 
PROFESSIONAL REQUIREMENT. 
THE FBI COMPLETED A 
SUPPLEMENTAL BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATION AND DELIVER THE 
RESULTS IN THE SENATE. 
MR. PRESIDENT, THIS IS NOW THE 
SEVENTH TIME THE FBI HAS 
THOROUGHLY REVIEWED JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S BACKGROUND. 
SEVEN FBI INVESTIGATIONS. 
WHAT DID WE LEARN? 
WHAT DO THE FACTS AND EVIDENCE 
TELL US AFTER SEVEN FBI 
INVESTIGATIONS? 
THE FACT IS THAT THESE 
ALLEGATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN 
CORROBORATED. NONE OF THE 
ALLEGATIONS HAD BEEN 
CORROBORATED BY THE SEVENTH FBI 
INVESTIGATION. 
NOT IN THE NEW FBI AND NOT 
ANYWHERE. 
NONE OF THESE FBI 
INVESTIGATIONS HAVE BEEN 
CORROBORATED AS AFFIRMED BY THE 
SEVENTH AND LATEST FBI 
INVESTIGATION. 
AS CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY STATED 
THIS MORNING, NEITHER THE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE NOR THE FBI 
COULD LOCATE ANY THIRD PARTIES 
WHO CAN ATTEST TO ANY OF THESE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
NO BACKUP FROM ANY WITNESSES, 
INCLUDING THOSE SPECIFICALLY 
NAMED AS EYE WITNESSES BY THE 
PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT THE 
ALLEGATIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE. 
LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. 
NO BACKUP FROM ANY WITNESSES, 
INCLUDING THOSE SPECIFICALLY 
NAMED AS EYE WITNESSES BY THE 
PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT THESE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
IN ADDITION, ONE PERSON HAS 
COMPLETELY RECANTED THEIR HOLE 
WILD STORY. ANOTHER ACCUSER 
WENT ON TELEVISION AND 
BACKPEDALED FOR MANY OF THE 
RIDICULOUS CHARGES. 
THE FACTS DO NOT SUPPORT THE 
ALLEGATIONS LEVIED AT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S CHARACTER. 
INSTEAD, MANY OF THEM ACTUALLY 
SUPPORT JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
STRONG, UNEQUIVOCAL DENIAL. 
HE REPEATEDLY STATED TO 
INVESTIGATORS, UNDER PENALTY OF 
FELONY FOR THIS. 
HE FIRMLY RESTATED UNDER OATH 
LAST THURSDAY FOR THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
THIS ALIGNS WITH THE TESTIMONY 
OF HUNDREDS, LITERALLY HUNDREDS 
OF CHARACTER WITNESSES WHO'VE 
KNOWN HIM OVER THE YEARS. 
FOR GOODNESS SAKE'S, THIS IS 
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 
NOBODY IS SUPPOSED TO BE GUILTY 
UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT IN THIS 
COUNTRY. 
NOBODY IS SUPPOSED TO BE GUILTY 
UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT IN THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 
THE SENATE SHOULD NOT SET A 
FUNDAMENTALLY UN-AMERICAN 
PRECEDENT HERE. JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S RIGHT TO BASIC 
FAIRNESS DOES NOT DISAPPEAR 
JUST BECAUSE SOME DISAGREE WITH 
THE JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY. 
OUR SOCIETY IS NOT A PLACE 
WHERE UNCORROBORATED 
ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT FROM 
NEARLY 40 YEARS AGO, ALLEGATIONS
VIGOROUSLY DISPUTED, CAN 
NULLIFY THE CAREER OR DESTROY 
THEIR REPUTATION. 
IS THAT WHAT THE SENATE WOULD 
BE KNOWN FOR? 
THE NOMINATION COMES HERE AND 
WE DESTROY YOUR REPUTATION? 
THAT'S WHAT THE SENATE IS GOING 
TO PARTICIPATE IN? 
ABOVE THE PARTISAN NOISE AND 
BEYOND THIS SHAMEFUL SPECTACLE, 
WHICH IS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE
SENATE, WHAT WILL ENDURE ARE 
THE ACTUAL FACTS BEFORE US. 
THE ACTUAL FACTS. UPON 
REVIEWING THEM, ONLY ONE 
QUESTION IS LEFT FOR US TO 
ANSWER. 
IS JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH 
QUALIFIED TO SERVE ON THE 
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT? 
WELL, MR. PRESIDENT, THERE'S A 
GOOD REASON THE POLITICAL 
OPPONENTS WOULDN'T WANT TO 
LITIGATE THAT ISSUE. 
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. 
THERE'S A GOOD REASON WHY THEY 
LET THE POLITICS OF PERSONAL 
DESTRUCTION RUN AWAY AHEAD OF 
THE FACTS. 
IN AN EFFORT TO DODGE THAT VERY 
GOOD QUESTION, BECAUSE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH IS STUNNINGLY AND 
TOTALLY QUALIFIED FOR THIS JOB. 
WE ALREADY KNOW THIS. 
FOR STARTERS, HIS ACADEMIC AND 
LEGAL CREDENTIALS ARE SECOND TO 
NONE. 
FROM YALE WITH HONORS AND ONTO 
YALE LAW SCHOOL AND THEN CAME 
ú 
CLERKSHIPS IN THE NATION'S 
FEDERAL COURTS, ENDING UP WITH 
JUSTICE KENNEDY. HIS CAREER 
CONTINUED WITH WORK IN THE 
OFFICE OF INDEPENDENT COUNSEL 
AND THE OFFICE OF WHITE HOUSE 
COUNSEL AND THAT WAS ONLY THE 
BEGINNING. 
FOR THE LAST 12 YEARS, BRETT 
KAVANAUGH HAS SERVED ON WHAT IS 
WIDELY CONSIDERED THE SECOND 
HIGHEST COURT IN OUR LAND, THE 
D.C. CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS 
WRITTEN MORE THAN 300 JUDICIAL 
OPINIONS, SEVERAL ON THE BASIS 
OF LATER RULINGS BY THE SUPREME 
COURT, ITSELF. 
THE LITANY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
IS A FACT, A FACT. 
A MATTER OF PUBLIC RECORD. 
ALL THE ACCOUNTS OF JUDGE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, THE PERSON, THEY 
HAVE BEEN VOLUNTEERED BY THOSE 
WHO HAVE KNOWN HIM EVERY STEP 
OF THE WAY OVER THE YEARS. 
WE'VE HEARD FROM LITERALLY 
HUNDREDS OF CHARACTER WITNESSES 
WHO HAVE HEAPED PRAISE ON THE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH THEY KNOW, THE 
LOYAL FRIEND AND TEAMMATE, THE 
STANDOUT STUDENT AND THE 
TALENTED HARD-WORKING COLLIE, 
THE BRILLIANT LEGAL WRITER, THE 
RESPECTD ROLE MODEL AND 
MENTOR, PARTICULARLY THE WOMEN. 
THE DEVOTED HUSBAND, FATHER AND 
COACH. 
THESE LETTERS AND RECORDED 
TESTIMONY WERE OFFERED BY MEN 
AND WOMEN WITH NOTHING TO GAIN 
FOR THEMSELVES. THEY WERE JUST 
GLAD TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT A 
NOMINEE THAT THEY KNOW 
POSSESSES THE CHARACTER 
TEMPERAMENT AND QUALIFICATIONS 
FOR THIS IMPORTANT JOB. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S PROFESSORS AND
OTHERS WHO KNEW HIM AT YALE 
DESCRIBE A TRUE INTELLECTUAL, A 
LEADING THINKER, A WONDERFUL 
MENTOR AND LEADER AND ONE WENT 
SO FAR AS TO SAY IT'S HARD TO 
NAME ANYONE WITH JUDICIAL 
CREDENTIALS AS STRONG AS THOSE 
OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
HIS FORMER LAW CLERKS AND 
úOTHE 
HUMILITY. THEY SAY HE GIVES 
UNFLINCHING AND HONEST ADVICE 
AND LISTENS CAREFULLY TO THE 
VIEWS OF HIS COLLEAGUES AND 
CLERKS EVEN WHEN THEY DIFFER 
FROM HIS OWN. 
IN WASHINGTON, FOR THE 
POLITICAL PERSUASIONS, THEY 
HAVEN'T MINCED THEIR WORDS AND 
GAVE HIM UNQUESTIONINGLY 
QUALIFIED BY HIS EXTRAORDINARY 
INTELLECT AND TEMPERAMENT AND 
WARNED THE SENATE NOT TO MISS 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO, QUOTE, PUT 
SUCH A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR 
DECENCY AND CIVILITY ON OUR 
NATION'S HIGHEST COURT. 
MR. PRESIDENT, LET'S NOT LOSE 
SIGHT OF THE OPPORTUNITY BEFORE 
US. 
THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN RULED BY 
FEAR AND ANGER AND UNDERHANDED 
GAMESMANSHIP FOR TOO LONG. 
IT'S TIME TO STAND UP FOR THIS 
KIND OF THING. 
WE OWE IT TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE NOT TO BE INTIMIDATED BY 
THESE TACTICS. 
WE OWE IT TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE TO UNDERSCORE THAT YOU 
ARE INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN 
GUILTY. 
IT'S THE SENATE ON TRIAL HERE, 
MR. PRESIDENT. 
WHAT KIND OF IMAGE WILL BE 
CONVEY TO THE PUBLIC? 
CAN WE BE SCARED BY ALL THESE 
PEOPLE RAMPAGING THROUGH THE 
HALLS ACCOSTING MEMBERS AT 
AIRPORTS AND COMING TO THEIR 
HOMES? 
TRYING TO INTIMIDATE THE SENATE 
INTO DEFEATING A GOOD MAN? 
WE SHOULDN'T ALLOW THIS TO 
HAPPEN. 
IN THIS COUNTRY? 
SO, WE WILL NOT PRETEND THAT 
PARTISAN HISTRIONICS WOULD TAKE 
AWAY THE BASIC FAIRNESS THAT 
EVERY AMERICAN DESERVES. 
WE WILL NOT BE HOODWINKED BY 
THOSE WHO HAVE TRIED HARD TO 
SMEAR THIS GOOD MAN AND DRAG 
HIM THROUGH THE MUD. WHEN THAT 
DIDN'T WORK, THEY TURNED ON A 
DIME AND STARTED CLAIMING HIS 
REAL SIN WAS THAT HE SPOKE OF 
TOO FORCEFULLY IN DEFENSE OF 
HIS GOOD NAME AND HIS FAMILY. 
THEY DECIDED HE DIDN'T HAVE A 
JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT BECAUSE HE 
AGGRESSIVELY DEFENDED HIS GOOD 
NAME. 
IT WAS AGAINST THIS OUTRAGEOUS 
SMEAR CONDUCTED IN CONJUNCTION 
WITH SENATE DEMOCRATS. 
WHO AMONG US WOULD NOT HAVE 
BEEN OUTRAGED BY HAVING A 
LIFETIME RECORD DRUG THROUGH 
THE MUD WITH ACCUSATIONS THAT 
CANNOT BE PROVEN? 
AND A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO DECIDE 
ON THE PART OF SOME DEMOCRATS 
THAT THE PRESUMPTION OF 
INNOCENCE NO LONGER APPLIES IN 
THIS COUNTRY. 
WHAT KIND OF PERSON COULDN'T 
HAVE BEEN UPSET ABOUT THAT? 
THEY CLAIM HE SPOKE TOO 
FORCEFULLY IN DEFENSE OF 
HIMSELF? 
AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF SUCH 
OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIOR THAT CANNOT 
BE PROVEN? 
I ADMIRE HIM FOR STANDING UP 
FOR HIMSELF AND STANDING UP FOR 
HIS FAMILY. 
I'D BE SHOCKED IF IT WERE NOT 
DONE IN AN AGGRESSIVE FASHION. 
FOR GOODNESS SAKE. 
SO, LET'S RECLAIM THIS MOMENT 
FOR WHAT IT SHOULD BE, A CHANCE 
TO ELEVATE A STUNNINGLY TALENTED
AND IMPRESSIVE JURIST IN AN 
IMPORTANT OFFICE FOR WHICH HE 
IS SO WELL-QUALIFIED. 
SO COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY 
QUALIFIED. 
A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE 
OUR GREAT NATION PRECISELY THE 
KIND OF BRILLIANT, FAIR-MINDED 
AND COLLEGIAL SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE THAT THE COURT 
DESERVES. 
THIS, MR. PRESIDENT, IS THE GOOD
THAT SENATORS WILL HAVE AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO DO. 
WE HAVE A CHANCE TO DO GOOD 
HERE. 
AND, TO UNDERSCORE THE BASIC 
TENANT OF FAIRNESS IN OUR 
COUNTRY. 
SO, YESTERDAY EVENING, I FOUND 
CLOSURE ON THE NOMINATION AND I 
WILL BE PROUD TO VOTE TO 
ADVANCES NOMINATION TOMORROW. 
>>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
THE MAJORITY LEADER IN THE 
SENATE TALKING AND WE'VE HEARD 
PREVIOUSLY FROM CHUCK GRASSLEY 
AND FROM THE DEMOCRATS, THE 
REACTION TO THE FBI EXPANDED 
INVESTIGATION AND NANCY CORDES 
WAS IN THE ROOM AT THE TIME. 
NANCY, YOU ARE JOINING US FROM 
CAPITOL HILL. 
WE ARE HEARING ARGUMENTS WE 
EXPECT IT FROM BOTH SIDES OF 
THE AISLE IN REGARDS TO THIS 
FBI DOCUMENT AND WHETHER IT 
SHEDS LIGHT OR WHETHER IT 
DOESN'T. 
JUST REMIND US WHAT WE HEARD 
FROM CHUCK SCHUMER MOMENTS AGO. 
>> Reporter: IT WAS INTERESTING 
BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T TAKE ANY 
QUESTIONS FROM US BUT WAS 
TANTALIZINGLY SAYING THAT 
WITHOUT GOING INTO DETAILS, 
DEMOCRATS DON'T AGREE WITH THE 
CONCLUSION BY THE WHITE HOUSE 
AND CHUCK GRASSLEY, THE CHAIR 
OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE, THAT THERE IS 
ESSENTIALLY NOTHING TO SEE IN 
THE REPORT AND NOTHING IN THERE 
TO CORROBORATE CHRISTINE BLASEY 
FORD'S CLAIMS. 
LEADER SCHUMER SAID WE DISAGREE 
WITH SENATOR GRASSLEY STATEMENT 
THAT THERE IS NO HINT OF 
MISCONDUCT IN THIS FBI REPORT. 
NOW, THE CHALLENGE IS THAT 
BECAUSE THE SENATORS ARE 
PROHIBITED FROM SPEAKING 
PUBLICLY ABOUT WHAT IS 
CONTAINED IN THE FBI REPORT, WE 
REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS 
REFERRING TO AND IT'S DIFFICULT 
TO JUDGE WHAT HE IS SAYING AND 
WHAT GRASSLEY IS SAYING ABOUT 
THE CONCLUSIONS THAT ONE WOULD 
REACH IF THEY WERE ABLE TO READ 
THIS FBI REPORT. 
IT'S SORT OF UNDER LOCK AND KEY 
RIGHT NOW IN A ROOM IN THE 
CAPITAL BASEMENT WHERE SENATORS 
CAN ONLY FILE IN AND GET A 
BRIEFING FROM CERTAIN APPROVED 
STAFFERS. 
THEY ARE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE 
DOCUMENT BUT THEY CAN'T TAKE IT 
FROM THE ROOM. 
ALL OF THIS IS BEING DONE TO 
MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE 
ACCESS TO IT AND WE AREN'T ABLE 
TO SEE CERTAIN DETAILS FROM 
THAT REPORT AND NOT OTHERS. 
IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO 
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE FBI DID 
FIND IN THOSE 10 OR SO 
INTERVIEWS AGENTS COULD 
CONDUCT. 
>> NANCY, I WILL POINT OUT THAT 
CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS IS WITH US 
AT THE TABLE. 
REPORTERS HAVE BEEN STAKING OUT 
SENATORS AND AS ANNE-MARIE 
POINTED OUT, WE HEARD FROM THE 
MAJORITY LEADER AND THE 
MINORITY LEADER BUT WHAT PEOPLE 
WANT TO HEAR FROM IS THE THREE 
KEY SENATORS, SUSAN COLLINS, 
JEFF FLAKE AND LISA MURKOWSKI 
AND MAYBE FOLKS LIKE JOE 
MANCHIN. 
WHAT HAVE WE HEARD, IF 
ANYTHING, FROM THOSE SENATORS 
AS TO WHAT THEY'VE SEEN AND 
WHAT THEY'VE READ IN THE REPORT 
AND HOW THEY FEEL NOW THAT THE 
INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE? 
>> Reporter: WE'VE HEARD 
EXACTLY NOTHING. 
WE DID SEE SENATOR COLLINS GO 
INTO THE ROOM AND WHERE THE FBI 
REPORT IS BEING HELD. 
WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM 
HER OR OTHER SENATORS YOU 
MENTIONED SINCE THEN. 
THE REALITY IS THAT EVERY 
INTEREST IS GOING TO MAKE IT 
APPEAR THAT THEY ARE MAKING A 
VERY REASONED DECISION BASED ON 
WHAT THEY VIEW IN THE REPORT. 
IT DOESN'T BEHOOVE THEM TO WALK 
RIGHT OUT AND MAKE A STATEMENT 
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER ABOUT 
WHETHER THEY THINK THE FBI 
INFORMATION IS COMPELLING OR 
WHETHER THEY ARE MOVED BY IT 
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. 
THEY HAVE BASICALLY HELD OUT 
THIS LONG DESPITE THE REPEATED 
QUESTIONS FOR THEM ABOUT WHERE 
THEY STAND. 
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THEY 
PROBABLY WILL HOLD ON AT LEAST 
A DAY LONGER UNTIL THE SENATE 
IS SET TO TAKE THE PROCEDURAL 
VOTE THAT YOU JUST HEARD THE 
REPUBLICAN LEADER, MITCH 
McCONNELL, TALK ABOUT ON THE 
SENATE FLOOR, SETTING UP A 
FINAL CONFIRMATION VOTE ON 
SATURDAY. 
>> NANCY, YOU KNOW THE CONGRESS 
BETTER THAN ANYBODY. 
I WONDER WHAT YOU ARE MAKING OF 
WHAT THIS MEANS FOR MITCH 
McCONNELL? 
IT'S BEEN FASCINATING TO WATCH 
HIM ON THE SENATE FLOOR USING 
SOME PRETTY PASSIONATE 
RHETORIC. 
>> ACTUALLY, THE SHOT YOU SAW, 
IT WENT DOWN FOR A SHOT OF THE 
CAPITOL BUILDING. 
WE JUST LOST HER. 
>> WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
HOW ACTIVE THIS WAS AND HOW 
VERBOSE. 
>> MY QUESTION WAS, WHAT DOES 
THIS MEAN FOR HIM AND HOW HE 
CALCULATES THIS? 
>> NANCY IS BACK. 
FINISH YOUR THOUGHT. 
>> I WANTED TO KEEP YOU ON YOUR 
TOES. 
>> MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. 
>> THE WAY MITCH McCONNELL 
THINKS ABOUT THIS, THE SENATE 
MAJORITY LEADER, HE IS PAYING 
SO CLOSELY ATTENTION TO THIS 
FOR THE SENATE RACES. 
HE KNOWS THEM INSIDE AND OUT 
AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN IN TERMS 
OF HIS LEGACY FOR BEING ABLE TO 
GET ANOTHER JUSTICE THROUGH? 
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW HE 
FACTORS THIS IN AND WHAT IT 
MEANS FOR HIM? 
>> THERE IS A SENSE ON CAPITOL 
HILL THAT MITCH McCONNELL MAY 
BE ON THE VERGE OF PULLING OFF 
A KIND OF HAT TRICK JIU-JITSU 
MOVE WHERE IF HE IS ABLE TO 
KEEP ALL OF HIS REPUBLICAN 
CONFERENCE TO GATHER AND 
CONFIRM JUDGE KAVANAUGH, HE 
WOULD HAVE A MANAGED TO STEER 
THE SENATE THROUGH THIS VERY 
CONTENTIOUS PROCESS, AND KEEP 
HIS PARTY TOGETHER AND GET 
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMED AND AT THE 
SAME TIME, ENERGIZE A LOT OF 
REPUBLICAN VOTERS WHO WEREN'T 
ALL THAT FIRED UP, ACCORDING TO 
POLLS FOR THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS 
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT NOT 
MANY LEADERS ON EITHER SIDE 
WOULD BE ABLE TO PULL OFF. 
WE DON'T KNOW IF HE WILL MANAGE 
TO DO IT. 
KEEP IN MIND THIS IS THE SAME 
MITCH McCONNELL MANAGED TO GET 
A LOT OF SUBURBAN REPUBLICAN 
VOTERS AROUND CITIES LIKE 
PHILADELPHIA INTERESTED IN 
VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP, TWO 
YEARS AGO. 
WAS PARTLY BECAUSE HE MADE THE 
FUTURE OF THE SUPREME COURT A 
HUGE ISSE FOR VOTERS, 
PARTICULARLY CONSERVATIVES WHO 
CARED ABOUT THIS WHEN HE 
WITHHELD A SEAT THAT DEMOCRATS 
WERE TRYING TO GIVE TO MERRICK 
GARLAND. 
THEY BASICALLY KEPT GARLAND 
FROM HAVING A HEARING OR VOTE 
FOR 10 MONTHS AND THAT 
CONVINCED ENOUGH SUBURBAN 
REPUBLICAN VOTERS THAT THIS 
WOULD BE A KEY ISSUE IN THE 
ELECTIONS. 
EVEN IF THEY WEREN'T THAT FOND 
OF DONALD TRUMP, SOME OF THEM, 
ENOUGH OF THEM, WENT TO THE 
POLLS TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS FOR 
HIM. 
THIS IS SOMEONE ALWAYS PLAYING 
THE LONG GAME AND THE FACT THAT 
HE HAS BEEN SO FORCEFUL ALL 
ALONG HAS BEEN A STRATEGY TO 
KEEP THINGS ON TRACK AND NEVER 
SHOW WEAKNESS AND NEVER SHOW 
THE CONCERN THAT THINGS MIGHT 
FALL APART. 
NO MATTER WHAT DISCUSSIONS YOU 
HAVE, ALWAYS, IN PUBLIC, SHOW 
THAT YOU WILL BRING THIS TO A 
CLOSE AND BE SUCCESSFUL. 
>> NANCY, STANDBY. 
WE WANT TO BRIEFLY PLAY THE 
SOUNDBITE FROM REPUBLICAN 
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM WHO SAID 
HE'S READY TO VOTE ON JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION. 
HE MADE THE REMARK ON CAPITOL 
HILL AND LET'S PLAY THAT AND WE 
WILL HAVE A CHAT. 
>> THE FBI HAS INTERVIEWED 10 
WITNESSES. 
THEY FOLLOWED LEADS FROM 
INTERVIEWS THAT MADE SENSE TO 
ME. 
IT'S A COMPLETE REPORT, A 
BACKGROUND CHECK AND I'M 
CONFIDENT THE FBI DID A GOOD 
JOB AND THEY WERE NOT HINDERED 
IN ANY WAY. 
THE FOCUS OF THE BACKGROUND 
CHECK WAS ON CREDIBLE 
ALLEGATIONS BEFORE THE 
COMMITTEE AND I WAS LOOKING FOR 
CERTAIN THINGS TO BE ANSWERED 
BY WITNESSES AND I'M MORE 
CONFIDENT THAT WHAT THE 
COMMITTEE FOUND HAS HELD UP, 
AND THEN SOME. 
THE MAIN THING FOR ME IS THAT 
YOU NEED TO GO TO THE FBI AND 
YOU NEED TO ASK THEM IF THEY 
FELT LIKE THEY WERE ABLE TO DO 
THEIR JOB WITHOUT INTERFERENCE. 
I THINK THE ANSWER IS YES. 
THEY INTERVIEWED OVER 150 
PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF 
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S LIFE. 
TO THOSE WHO SUGGEST HE HAD A 
PROBLEM LIKE THIS FROM PRIOR 
INTERVIEWS, NO EVIDENCE OF 
THAT. 
IT'S ALL MANUFACTURED. 
THE SENATORS WHO REQUESTED THE 
SUPPLEMENTAL FBI BACKGROUND 
CHECK GOT WHAT THEY REQUESTED 
AND I AND READY TO VOTE. 
>> Reporter: ARE YOU CONFIDENT 
THE SENATORS -- >> YOU NEED TO 
TALK TO THEM. 
I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE 
SUPPLEMENTAL FBI BACKGROUND 
CHECK WAS DONE PROFESSIONALLY 
AND WITHOUT INTERFERENCE AND 
INVALIDATED -- IN MY VIEW -- 
WHERE WE ARE. 
YOU NEED TO TALK TO THEM. 
THE IDEA THAT THE FBI WAS 
LOOKING AT THE COMMITTEE WORK 
PRODUCT MADE SOME SENSE. I 
DIDN'T NEED IT, BUT IT'S DONE 
AND PUTS A STAMP ON IT THAT IS 
DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS BEFORE. 
YOU NEED TO GO TO THESE THREE 
WHO HAVE, IN GOOD FAITH, TRIED 
TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE 
AND WHAT IS BEST FOR THE 
COUNTRY. 
150 PLUS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
INTERVIEWED OVER A 20 SOMETHING 
YEAR PERIOD. 
NOT A CLOSE FRIEND, BUT 
PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP. 
THE BRETT KAVANAUGH I KNEW 
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IS THE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH I KNOW NOW AND 
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE 
EFFORT TO RUIN THIS MAN'S LIFE. 
I AM READY TO VOTE. 
>> YOU JUST HEARD FROM SENATOR 
LINDSEY GRAHAM WITH NO 
SURPRISES AT ALL. I 
WILL SAY FOR HIM TO SUGGEST HE 
DIDN'T NEED THE FBI REPORT 
COMPLETELY DISCOUNTS THE 
ALLEGATION OF SOMEONE WHO SAID 
SHE HAS SURVIVED BUT LET'S LOOK 
AT THE FLOOR WERE SENATOR CHUCK 
SCHUMER IS MAKING SOME 
COMMENTS. 
>> AGAIN, ARE YOU ACCUSING DR. 
FORD OF ENGAGING IN THE 
POLITICS OF PERSONAL 
DESTRUCTION? 
HE TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE BEING 
INTIMIDATED. 
AGAIN, MR. LEADER, ARE YOU 
ACCUSING DR. FORD OF 
INTIMIDATING THE SENATE BECAUSE 
SHE HAD THE COURAGE TO COME 
FORWARD? 
HE TALKS OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
ABOUT THE OUTRAGEOUS SMEAR. MR. 
LEADER, IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU 
CAME FORWARD AND CAME CLEAN. 
WHEN YOU SAY OUTRAGEOUS SMEAR, 
YOU REALLY ARE REFERRING TO 
WHAT DR. FORD SAID. 
YOU CAN'T SAY SO BECAUSE 
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT KIND OF 
RHETORIC WOULD BE OUTRAGEOUS. 
BUT, IT'S HER TESTIMONY THAT 
GOT THIS WHOLE THING GOING. 
HER TESTIMONY WAS REQUIRED BY 
ONE COURAGEOUS REPUBLICAN WHO 
SAID HE WOULDN'T RUSH THINGS 
THROUGH AS LEADER McCONNELL 
ATTEMPTED TO DO. 
THAT IS WHY THERE WAS A 
HEARING. 
IT'S NOT FOR DEMOCRATS, BUT I 
SAID YESTERDAY THAT THE LEADER 
IS TELLING ONE OF THE GREATEST 
MYSTERIES I'VE HEARD ON THE 
FLOOR, THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE 
DELAYED. 
AGAIN, MR. LEADER, WHAT POWER 
DO WE HAVE TO DELAY. 
ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU SET THE 
TIME AND PLACE OF HEARINGS OR 
THE COMMITTEE CHAIRS DO AND USE 
AT THE TIME AND PLACE OF WHEN 
WE VOTE WITH NO EFFECT FROM THE 
DEMOCRATS? 
NO INFLUENCE BY DEMOCRATS? 
IF YOU DELAY, IT'S BECAUSE 
YOU'VE DELAYED AND IF THERE 
HAVE BEEN DELAYS, IT IS BECAUSE 
YOU HAVE DELAYED BUT 
ULTIMATELY, DR. FORD CAME 
FORWARD AND WON AMERICA'S 
HEARTS. 
OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES WERE 
UPSET BECAUSE THAT MIGHT DERAIL 
THEIR HEADLONG RUSH TO PUT 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH ON THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
IT WAS LED BY JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
AT HIS RETURN TESTIMONY AND BY 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND BY 
LEADER McCONNELL. 
THEY'VE TRIED TO MISDIRECT THE 
WHOLE ISSUE AWAY FROM DR. FORD, 
WHO WAS THE CAUSE AND THE 
REASON WE ARE DEBATING ALL OF 
THIS AND TOWARDS OTHER MEN AND 
WOMEN, MANY THAT ARE DEMOCRATS, 
COINCIDENTLY. 
IT'S WRONG. OUR REPUBLICAN 
FRIENDS ARE DOING WHAT MY DEAR 
FRIEND THE LEADER IS DOING, AND 
IT'S DEMEANING TO DR. FORD. 
DEMEANING IS THE LAST THING 
DOCTOR FORD AND OTHERS WHO HAVE 
GONE THROUGH WHAT SHE HAS GONE 
THROUGH NEED NOW. 
OR, DESERVES NOW. 
SO, I WOULD SAY TO THE LEADER, 
IF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 
PARTISAN HISTRIONICS, IF YOU 
ARE TALKING ABOUT POLITICS OF 
PERSONAL DESTRUCTION, IF YOU 
ARE TALKING ABOUT BEING 
INTIMIDATED AND TALKING ABOUT 
OUTRAGEOUS SMEARS, YOU ARE 
REALLY ACCUSING DR. FORD OF ALL 
THOSE THINGS, NOT ANYONE ELSE. 
BECAUSE, SHE IS THE REASON WE 
ARE ALL HERE IN THIS TYPE OF 
DISCUSSION. 
NO DEMOCRAT IMPORTUNED HER TO 
COME. 
NO DEMOCRAT. SENATOR FEINSTEIN 
TRIED TO RESPECT HER WISHES AND 
NOT MAKE IT PUBLIC. 
THAT WAS NOT A POLITICAL 
INSTINCT, IT WAS A HUMAN 
INSTINCT. 
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN STAFF CALLED EACH WEEK
AND ASKED IF SHE WANTED TO GO 
PUBLIC NOW AND DR. FORD SAID NO 
AND DIANNE FEINSTEIN AND 
RESPECTED IT. 
BECAUSE SHE DID THAT, THE 
REPUBLICAN FRIENDS ACCUSE HER OF
MANIPULATING. 
MANIPULATING WHAT? 
DR. FORD'S DESIRE TO KEEP THIS 
PRIVATE? 
WE HEARD WHAT DR. FORD SAID. 
SHE WRESTLED WITH DECIDING 
WHETHER TO GO PUBLIC AND KNEW 
THE DAMAGE IT WOULD CREATE FOR 
HER FAMILY AND FOR HER LIFE, 
HER VERY LIFE. 
SHE DECIDED SHE HAD AN 
OBLIGATION TO COME FORWARD. 
SHE DECIDED SHE HAD TOO. 
I BELIEVE HER. A 
LARGE NUMBER OF AMERICANS 
BELIEVE HER. 
EVEN IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE HER, 
AND YOU CHOOSE TO BELIEVE JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, DON'T DEMEAN DR. FORD
. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE 
DOING. 
IT'S A SHAME, A LOW POINT IN A 
HEADLONG RUSH TO GET SOMEBODY 
WHO HAS VIEWS OUT OF TOUCH WITH 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, IN ALL 
LIKELIHOOD, THEY WOULD GREATLY 
LIMIT WOMEN'S HEALTH AND THE 
RIGHT TO CHOOSE, WHO WOULD 
GREATLY CONSTRAIN HEALTHCARE 
AND WOULD ALLOW THE PRESIDENT 
THIS OVERREACHING PRECEDENT TO 
OVERREACH WITH NO CONSTRAINT. 
DR. FORD SEEMS TO BE A CASUALTY 
ALONG THE WAY. 
IN TERMS OF THE NAME CALLING, 
THE NASTINESS, AND THE 
VICIOUSNESS. 
THEY DON'T SAY IT IS DR. FORD. 
BUT, MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT. 
IT IS HER THEY ARE TALKING 
ABOUT. 
T WAS ONLY SHE WHO BROUGHT 
THESE THINGS UP, NOT DEMOCRATS. 
DEMOCRATS DIDN'T PUT WORDS IN 
HER MOUTH. 
THESE CAME FROM THE HEART. 
NOW, I MAKE THREE FINAL POINTS 
ABOUT THE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE 
RELEASED LATE LAST NIGHT. 
FIRST, WE DEMOCRATS HAD MANY 
FEARS THAT THIS WOULD BE AN ALL 
TOO LIMITED PROCESS THAT WOULD 
CONSTRAIN THE FBI FROM GETTING 
THE FACTS. HAVING RECEIVED A 
THOROUGH BRIEFING A FEW MINUTES 
AGO, OUR FEARS HAVE BEEN 
REALIZED. 
OUR FEARS HAVE BEEN REALIZED 
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION. 
ACCORDING TO DR. FORD'S LAWYERS 
AND THE LAWYERS FOR MS. 
RAMIREZ, THERE WERE MANY 
WITNESSES THAT WISHED TO BE 
INTERVIEWED AND THEY SAID THEY 
WERE NOT INTERVIEWED. 
THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN. 
WHY NOT? 
WHAT LIMITS WERE PLACED ON THE 
FBI? 
IT WAS THAT THEY COULDN'T DO A 
FULL AND THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION. 
THE WORD IS IT WAS THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
IT WAS IMPORTUNED BY SOME 
SENATE STAFFERS HERE. 
WELL, THE WHITE HOUSE HAS TWO 
CHOICES. 
THEY CAN ADMIT IT OR IF THEY 
DENY IT, THEY SHOULD, AT THE 
VERY MINIMUM, MAKE THE 
DIRECTIVE THAT THEY SENT TO THE 
FBI PUBLIC. IF THE WHITE HOUSE 
DIDN'T LIMIT WHAT THEY FBI 
NORMALLY DOES WHEN THEY DO ONE 
OF THESE BACKGROUND CHECKS, IT 
SURE SEEMS THEY DID, GIVEN THE 
LIMITED NUMBER OF WITNESSES OR 
SO MANY WITNESSES THAT WEREN'T 
CALLED THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. 
MAKE IT PUBLIC. 
LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SEE 
WHETHER IT WAS TRULY LIMITED OR 
NOT. 
AND WHAT ELSE SHOULD BE MADE 
PUBLIC ARE THESE DOCUMENTS THAT 
WE ARE ALLOWED TO LOOK AT. 
FIRST, AGAIN, THE IDEA THAT 
THIS SHOULD BE FULL AND 
THOROUGH AND OPEN AND AVAILABLE
, IT'S ONCE AGAIN BELIED BY THE 
PETTINESS OF THE REPUBLICAN SIDE
AND THE WHITE HOUSE. 
THERE'S ONLY ONE DOCUMENT FOR 
100 MEMBERS TO SEE IN THE 
COURSE OF THE DAY. 
THAT IS VERY HARD TO DO. 
THERE'S A LOT OF DOCUMENTS AND 
ONLY ONE COPY OF THE DOCUMENTS. 
WHY AREN'T THERE 10 COPIES IN 
THAT ROOM? 
WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE? 
IT'S JUST A PATTERN. 
A PATTERN OF LIMITING ACCESS TO 
FACTS AND LIMITING ACCESS TO 
TRUTH AND LIMITING ACCESS TO 
WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OUGHT 
TO KNOW. 
SO, I REITERATE MY CALL, 
PARTICULARLY AFTER RECEIVING THE
BRIEFING ABOUT WHAT THE 
DOCUMENTS CONTAINED. 
THEY SHOULD BE MADE PUBLIC. 
OBVIOUSLY, THERE HAS TO BE 
APPROPRIATE REDACTIONS. 
AND, THERE SHOULD BE TO PROTECT 
THE PRIVACY OF THOSE WHO WERE 
INTERVIEWED. 
BUT, THERE IS NO REASON ON GODS 
GREEN GREEN EARTH THAT THOSE 
DOCUMENTS CAN'T BE MADE PUBLIC. 
LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DECIDE. 
LEADER McCONNELL SAID FROM THE 
BEGINNING TO THE EFFECT HE 
WOULD RUSH THIS THROUGH, 
STARTING WITH NOT RELEASING 
DOCUMENTS, FOLLOWED BY 
CONSTRAINTS FROM OUR SENATE 
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ON WHAT 
SHOULD BE LIMITATIONS ON THE 
FBI'S ABILITY TO DO THE NEW 
BACKGROUND CHECK ALL THE WAY TO 
THIS MORNING WITH ONE DOCUMENT 
IN THAT ROOM. 
THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE IN THE SENATE 
HAS ATTEMPTED TO RUSH THIS 
THROUGH REGARDLESS OF THE 
FACTS. 
IT'S WRONG. THE RELATIONSHIPS 
BETWEEN THIS, WHICH WE ALL WANT 
TO BE BETTER, IT HURTS WITH THE 
AGENCIES INVOLVED IN THE 
REPUTATION OF THE FBI AND ABOVE 
ALL, IT HURTS THE SUPREME COURT 
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, ONCE 
AGAIN. 
OF THIS PROCESSHAD BEEN OPEN 
AND FAIR, THE OUTCOME MAY HAVE 
BEEN DIFFRENT OR MAYBE IT 
WOULDN'T. 
WHO COULD TELL? 
AT LEAST THERE WOULD BE SOME 
RESPECT FOR THE PROCESS. 
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED AND THAT 
IS VERY BAD FOR THIS BODY, FOR 
THE SUPREME COURT AND FOR THESE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 
I YIELD TO THE FLOOR. 
>> THE CLERK WILL CALL THE 
ROLL. 
>>> WE JUST HEARD FROM CHUCK 
SCHUMER AND IT LOOKS LIKE 
SENATOR KENNEDY, JOHN KENNEDY, 
IS MAKING A STATEMENT TO THE 
PRESS. 
LET'S LISTEN IN. 
>> YOU WERE SURPRISED, WHY? 
I THINK THE DEMOCRATIC STRATEGY 
IS CLEAR. 
STALL AND RESTALL. 
I SAID THIS THE OTHER DAY. 
PUT DOWN THE SEARCH OF THE 
TRUTH, THIS IS SMASHMOUTH RAW 
POLITICS. 
THAT'S ALL IT IS AND I WISH I 
DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY THAT. 
I'M NOT SAYING SOME PEOPLE 
AREN'T IN GOOD FAITH. 
THEY ARE, I THINK. 
BUT, THERE ARE MANY -- THE 
MANTRA AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF 
THIS IS TO WIN, BABY. 
JUST WIN. 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO GETS 
HURT. 
DR. FORD, DOESN'T MATTER. 
RUN RIGHT OVER HER IN BREACH OF 
CONFIDENTIALITY AND RUIN HER 
FAMILY AND RUIN HER REPUTATION. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, HE'S 
EXPENDABLE, THEY THINK. 
IT DOESN'T MATTER. 
DESTROY HIS REPUTATION AND 
DESTROY HIS FAMILY. 
WHOEVER GETS IN THE WAY IS RUN 
OVER. 
THIS ISN'T ABOUT A SEARCH FOR 
THE TRUTH, IT IS WIN, BABY, WIN 
AT ANY COST AND I'VE BEEN HERE 
FOR 20 MONTHS, NOW. 
IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE REALLY 
SEEN THE DARK SIDE OF THIS 
PLACE. 
IT'S NOT PRETTY. 
NOT PRETTY. 
AMERICA DESERVES BETTER THAN 
THIS. 
ANYTHING ELSE? 
AND LET ME SAY ONE OTHER THING. 
AFTER THIS IS OVER, ONE WAY OR 
THE OTHER, IT WILL BE PEOPLE 
SPINNING ABOUT WHO WON AND WHO 
LOST. 
I ATTENDED EVERY MINUTE OF THE 
HEARING WITH DR. FORD AND JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH. 
THERE WERE NO WINNERS IN THAT 
ROOM. 
NON-. ALL I SAW WERE TWO HUMAN 
BEINGS IN PAIN. 
ESPECIALLY DR. FORD. 
WHOEVER FAILED IN THEIR 
MISSION, THE RESPONSIBILITY TO 
TELL DR. FORD THAT SHE HAD THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY PRIVATELY
, TO THE SENATE INVESTIGATORS 
AND IN HER HOME, THEY OUGHT TO 
HIDE HIS OR HER HEAD IN A BAG. 
THAT IS JUST UNCONSCIONABLE. 
WHOEVER BREACHED THE 
CONFIDENTIALITY OF DR. FORD AND 
LEAKED HER CONFIDENTIAL LETTER, 
THEY HAVE NO SOUL. 
>> OKAY. 
WE APPRECIATE IT. 
>>> SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY OF 
LOUISIANA IS MAKING SOME 
COMMENTS TO MEMBERS OF THE 
PRESS. 
ESSENTIALLY, WHAT WE ARE 
HEARING FROM THE REPUBLICANS ON 
MONDAY IS THAT THE FBI REPORT 
REVEALS NOTHING NEW AND THAT 
MEANS BRETT KAVANAUGH CAN BE 
AND SHOULD BE CONFIRMED 
IMMEDIATELY AND DEMOCRATS SAY 
THE PROCESS IS RIGGED AND WE 
DON'T HAVE TIME TO CONDUCT THE 
INVESTIGATION AND THERE WASN'T 
ENOUGH TIME TO TALK TO OTHER 
FOLKS. 
ON THE BUBBLE, WHAT THEY WOULD 
DO IT IS THAT WE WOULD SEE A 
NARRATIVE THIS IS WHAT THEY 
WOULD ASK FOR, THIS IS WHAT THE 
SENATORS WOULD ASK FOR. 
JEFF FLAKE, SUSAN COLLINS,WE 
GAVE IT TO THEM AND I WAS READY 
TO DO THIS LAST WEEK AND TWO 
WEEKS AGO BUT THEY WANTED TO 
CHECK INTO THIS AND WE LET THEM 
DO THIS. 
THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO SAY 
-- AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM CHUCK 
SCHUMER -- THAT THIS IS NOT 
POLITICS. 
JOHN KENNEDY SAID IT'S NOT 
POLITICS. 
THIS IS A WOMAN, LIKE MANY 
WOMEN, WHO CAME FORWARD ABOUT 
SOMETHING THAT IS HORRIFIC AND 
HAPPENED TO HER AND HAPPENED TO 
OTHER WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY. 
WHAT YOU ESSENTIALLY ARE DOING 
IS DISCOUNTING HER ALLEGATION 
BY SAYING THAT SHE SOMEHOW WAS 
A POLITICAL PAWN. 
SOMEHOW, SHE IS A DEMOCRATIC 
OPERATIVE WHO HAD BEEN IN PLACE 
TO TAKE DOWN BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
>> THAT IS WHY YOU HEAR 
REPUBLICANS FOCUSING OVER AND 
OVER AGAIN ON THE PROCESS AND 
THAT IS A WAY FOR THEM TO AT 
LEAST PUBLICLY SAY THAT WE FEEL 
FOR DR. FORD AND WE FEEL FOR 
KAVANAUGH AND THAT DEMOCRATS 
DID A DISSERVICE TO BOTH OF 
THEM, AS YOU HEARD KENNEDY SAY. 
IT WAS THE WAY THEY WENT ABOUT 
THIS WILL REAP -- WITH 
REPUBLICANS HAVING ADS IN 
SENATE RACES FOCUSING ON THE 
PROCESS AND THEY FEEL THAT IS 
THE WAY TO APPEAL TO PEOPLE. 
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THIS BACK 
AND FORTH BETWEEN REPUBLICANS 
AND DEMOCRATS ON THE SAME 
COMMITTEE WHO HAVE VIEWED THE 
SAME DOCUMENT, PRESENTING TWO 
DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF WHAT 
HAPPENED AND WHAT SHOULD 
HAPPEN. 
AT THE END OF THE DAY, 
REPUBLICANS CONTROL ALL OF THE 
MOVEMENT ON THE FLOOR AND THEY 
CONTROL THE SENATE. 
YOU SAW MITCH McCONNELL AS VERY 
EAGER TO VOTE WITH A LOT OF 
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE EAGER 
TO VOTE AND GET THIS BEHIND 
THEM. 
THEY ARE FUELED BY SHOWING THIS 
ENTHUSIASM AND ITS INCREASED 12 
POINTS ACCORDING TO THE NPR 
POLL RELEASED. 
AMONG REPUBLICANS, IT'S REALLY 
IMPORTANT BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH 
THEY ARE IN POWER, THEY HAVE 
NOT REALLY FOUND AN ISSUE THAT 
REALLY MOTIVATES THE VOTERS TO 
TURN OUT AND SAY THANKS. 
THEY HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING 
THAT MOTIVATES THEM TO TURN OUT 
AND BE ANGRY ABOUT THE OTHER 
SIDE AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO DO 
WHEN YOU ARE IN POWER BECAUSE 
YOU CONTROL EVERYTHING ON THIS 
ISSUE THEY FOUND IT AND THAT IS 
WHETHER THEY CAN SUSTAIN THAT, 
MOVING FORWARD. 
THE OTHER THING -- I'M 
INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT SUSAN 
COLLINS THINKS OF THIS REPORT 
AND WAGER -- AND WHETHER SHE 
THINKS IT WAS DONE FAIRLY OR IS 
ACCEPTING OF THE RESULTS. 
OF COURSE, SHE IS THE MOST 
IMPORTANT VOICE ON THIS AT THE 
MOMENT. 
>> ALSO, THINKING ABOUT THE RED 
STATE DEMOCRATS AND WHETHER OR 
NOT IT IS SAFE FOR THEM TO VOTE 
RIGHT NOW. 
INDIVIDUALLY, THEY ARE 
MAINTAINING THEIR SEAT. 
IF THERE IS OVERWHELMING 
SUPPORT, THEY DON'T REALLY 
FACTOR IN HOW THEY VOTE. 
I IMAGINE THAT NO ONE WANTS TO 
BE LIKE THE DECIDING VOTE. 
>> IT FACTORS INTO THEIR 
REELECTIONS, IF YOU ARE JOE 
MANCHIN. 
>> WE'RE SEEING POLLING WHERE 
IT SHOWS NORTH DAKOTA THAT 
SHOWS ALMOST A DOUBLE DIGIT 
LEAD FOR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. 
REMEMBER, THAT IS WHY WE PAY 
ATTENTION TO JOE MANCHIN, WHO 
ALSO VOTED FOR GORSUCH AND 
COMES FROM A STATE THAT DONALD 
TRUMP ONE OVERWHELMINGLY AND IS 
POPULAR. 
THIS IS A DIFFICULT POSITION 
AND ALSO WHY REPUBLICANS ARE 
EAGER TO HAVE A VOTE ON THIS 
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN 
CORNER THESE RED STATE 
DEMOCRATS AND EVEN IF THEY 
DON'T VOTE WITH THEM, THEY 
ANTICIPATE THAT THEY ARE ABLE 
TO CAPTURE THE VOTE AND RUN ADS 
IN PLACES LIKE NORTH DAKOTA, 
INDIANA AND WEST VIRGINIA, YOU 
NAME IT AND SAY THIS PERSON WAS 
AGAINST THE REPUBLICAN AGENDA. 
>> WE HAVE A STATEMENT FROM 
SUSAN COLLINS. 
WE WEREN'T ABLE TO GET HER ON 
CAMERA BUT SHE SAID, THEIR 
APPEARS TO BE A THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION BUT I'M GOING 
BACK LATER TODAY TO PERSONALLY 
READ THE INTERVIEWS. 
THAT IS REALLY ALL I HAVE TO 
SAY RIGHT NOW. 
>> IT SEEMS LIKE SHE IS TRYING 
TO GET TO A YES. 
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO 
CONSIDER. 
THE REASON REPUBLICANS HAVE 
UNITED AROUND DONALD TRUMP WAS 
MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE ABILITY 
TO APPOINT SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICES AND SHAPE THE BENCHES 
AROUND THE COUNTRY ON A FEDERAL 
LEVEL. 
SUSAN COLLINS HAS BEEN TALKING 
FAVORABLY BEFORE THE 
ALLEGATIONS CAME OUT, TALKING 
PRETTY FAVORABLY ABOUT 
KAVANAUGH. 
HER ONE STICKING POINT OR ONE OF
THEM, WAS THE ISSUE OF ROE V. 
WADE. 
SHE EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT 
HE WOULD HONOR PRESIDENT AND 
EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THE COURT 
WOULDN'T OVERTURN HEALTH CARE, 
AND ANOTHER KEY ISSUE FOR THESE 
FOLKS. 
SO, THE INVESTIGATION, AS WE 
TALKED ABOUT EARLIER, IT COULD 
PROVIDE A POLITICAL COVER. 
THE FBI PROBE COULD PROVIDE 
THAT FOR REPUBLICANS THAT 
WANTED TO GET TO A YES BUT WERE 
CONCERNED ABOUT THE BACKDROP OF 
THESE ALLEGATIONS. 
>> AS YOU SAID DURING THE 
CONVERSATIONS WHEN WE WEREN'T ON
CAMERA, THIS MAY ULTIMATELY -- 
AND I THINK NANCY POINTED OUT 
-- FOR LEADER McCONNELL, THIS 
ACTION HAVING THE FBI DO THE 
INVESTIGATION ULTIMATELY WAS 
COALESCING FOR REPUBLICANS. 
EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT A FAN OF 
DONALD TRUMP AND YOU ARE A 
REPUBLICAN, YOU CAME OUT IN 
SUPPORT OF BRETT KAVANAUGH 
BECAUSE YOU FELT HE WAS BEING 
UNFAIRLY TREATED, RAILROADED. 
HOWEVER YOU WANT TO 
CHARACTERIZE IT, THE QUESTION 
IS THAT IT IS A WIN FOR THE 
REPUBLICANS IF HE IS NOMINATED 
AND CONFIRMED. 
BUT, WHAT HAPPENS TO MODERATE 
WOMEN IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS 
AND WHAT HAPPENS TO MODERATE 
WOMEN GOING FORWARD AND WE KNOW 
THAT THE BASE IS STRONG AND WE 
KNOW DONALD TRUMP REMAINS 
POPULAR AMONG REPUBLICANS. 
WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE THAT ARE 
UNDECIDED AND DON'T LIKE THINGS 
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE? 
>> OUR CBS BATTLEGROUND 
TRACKING POLL SHOWED A 12-POINT 
DIFFERENCE IN THE GENDER GAP 
FAVORING DEMOCRATS IN TERMS OF 
THEIR VIEWS ON KAVANAUGH. 
WOMEN ARE PLAYING A CRITICAL 
ROLE IN THE ELECTION. 
THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE 
COMPETITIVE IN NOVEMBER, THEY 
COULD SWAY THE BALANCE OF POWER 
IN THE HOUSE. 
IF NOT, THE SENATE. 
SO, WOMEN HAVE BEEN THE FOCUS 
OF ALL OF THIS AND OF COURSE, 
IT COMES AGAINST THE BACKDROP 
OF THE #METOO MOVEMENT AND YOU 
ARE SEEING A TIME MAGAZINE 
COVER THIS WEEK WITH CHRISTINE 
BLASEY FORD ILLUSTRATED BY HER 
OWN WORDS, A VERY POWERFUL 
COVER. 
WE'VE SEEN WOMEN RUNNING FOR 
OFFICE IN RECORD NUMBERS AND 
THAT RECORD NUMBER HAS FAVORED 
DEMOCRATS MORE THAN 
REPUBLICANS. 
YOU SEE CANDIDATES REALLY 
PLAYING THAT UP ON THE CAMPAIGN 
TRAIL. 
AS WE KNOW, WOMEN ARE NOT A 
MONOLITHIC GROUP, OF COURSE IN 
DONALD TRUMP TALKS A LOT ABOUT 
HOW HE WON REPUBLICAN WOMEN. 
WHITE WOMEN. 
HE SAYS HE
>> REPUBLICANS ARE FACTORING IN 
THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
HAS SO ALIENATED SOME OF THE 
SWING VOTERS THAT THEY ARE 
ALREADY IN THE HOLE. 
THE KEY STRATEGY AT THIS POINT 
IS TO KEEP THE BASE EXCITED AND 
INCENTIVIZED TO TURN OUT AND 
VOTE. 
THAT IS THE FOCAL POINT RIGHT 
NOW AND THEY BELIEVE AT THIS 
POINT IN TIME, WE ARE STILL IN 
OCTOBER, A MONTH AWAY, THEY 
BELIEVE THIS WILL BE A GAME 
CHANGER IN TERMS OF MOMENTUM 
FOR THEM ON THE REPUBLICAN 
SIDE. 
>> EVERY TIME THE PRESIDENT 
MAKES FUN OF A VICTIM, LIKE HE 
DID CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, 
REPUBLICANS MUST BE BITING 
THEIR NAILS. 
YOU SAW A LOT OF THEM COME OUT 
AND SAY THEY THOUGHT IT WAS 
HORRIBLE. 
>> I WAS GOING TO SAY, IT IS 
HORRIBLE, BUT I AM STILL VOTING 
TO CONFIRM. 
>> YOU HEARD COLLINS, 
MURKOWSKI, FLAKE, ALL CONDEMNED 
THE PRESIDENTS LANGUAGE, BUT IF 
THEY VOTE TO CONFIRM HIM, HE 
WON'T FACE A POLITICAL 
úCONSEQU 
THE POLITICAL MAP IS BECOMING 
MORE COMPETITIVE, BUT IT DOES 
FAVOR REPUBLICANS AT THIS TIME, 
GIVEN THE STATES THAT ARE IN 
PLAY AND WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS 
POPULAR. 
ON THE HOUSE SIDE, THEY ARE 
COMPETING ON A DIFFERENT 
BATTLEFIELD. 
THEY ARE COMPLETING -- COMPETING
IN THE SUBURBS, CHANGING THE 
DEMOGRAPHICS WHERE IT -- WHERE 
WOMEN ARE PLAYING A KEY ROLE. 
THERE IS A CONCERN THAT HE 
FURTHER ALIENATES FOLKS IN 
THOSE KEY DISTRICTS. 
IT REALLY IS A TALE OF TWO 
ELECTIONS. 
>> ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE YOUR 
INSIGHT. 
I KNOW YOU WILL BE WITH US FOR 
THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. 
LET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND 
DIGEST EVERYTHING THAT HAS 
HAPPENED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF 
HOURS. 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF NEWS, 
INCLUDING THAT STORY OUT OF 
SOUTH CAROLINA WHERE WE HAVE 
BEEN GETTING NEW INFORMATION 
OVER THE COURSE OF THESE LAST 
COUPLE OF HOURS, AS TO WHAT 
HAPPENED IN A SITUATION WHERE 
ONE INDIVIDUAL AT THIS POINT 
APPEARS GUNNED DOWN. 
SEVEN POLICE OFFICERS WERE 
SHOT, ONE WAS KILLED. 
WE WILL CHECK IN WITH DAVID 
BEGNAUD AND HAVE A LOT MORE  
POLITICS OUT OF WASHINGTON. 
CHECK AROUND. 
-- STICK AROUND. 
>>> HI EVERYONE, I AM ANNE-
MARIE GREEN.  
>> AND I AM VLADIMIR DUTHIERS, 
THANKS FOR JOINING US.  
SENATORS ARE REVIEWING THE 
FBI'S NEW REPORT ON BRETT 
KAVANAUGH IN A SECURE ROOM. 
THE REPORT COMES AFTER 
INVESTIGATORS LOOKED AT THE 
SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS MADE 
AGAINST THE SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE. 
IT WAS DELIVERED TO THE SENATE 
OVERNIGHT AND NOW THAT REPORT 
IS IN HAND. 
A FINAL VOTE TO CONFIRM 
KAVANAUGH  COULD HAPPEN AS SOON 
AS SATURDAY. 
>> ACCORDING TO THE WALL STREET 
JOURNAL, THE WHITE HOUSE SAW NO 
CORROBORATION OF THE 
ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN 
DENIED BY THE NOMINEE. 
ATTORNEYS FOR ONE OF 
KAVANAUGH'S ACCUSERS, CHRISTINE 
BLASEY FORD, SAYS THERE CLIENT 
WAS NOT INTERVIEWED AND ACCUSED 
THE INVESTIGATORS OF BEING 
UNINTERESTED IN SEEKING THE 
TRUTH. 
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYS HE 
HAS READY TO VOTE ON JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION. 
HE MADE THE REMARK TO REPORTERS 
ON CAPITOL HILL A SHORT WHILE 
AGO. 
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN. 
>> THE FBI IS DONE. 
THEY INTERVIEWED 10 WITNESSES. 
THEY FOLLOWED LEADS FROM 
INTERVIEWS THAT MADE SENSE TO 
ME. 
IT IS A COMPLETE REPORT. 
THERE IS A BACKGROUND CHECK. 
úI 
GOOD JOB. 
THEY WERE NOT HINDERED IN ANY 
WAY. 
THE FOCUS OF THE BACKGROUND 
CHECK WAS ON CREDIBLE 
ALLEGATIONS BEFORE THE 
COMMITTEE. 
I WAS LOOKING FOR CERTAIN 
THINGS TO BE ANSWERED BY 
WITNESSES. 
I AM MORE CONFIDENT THAN EVER 
THAT WHAT THE COMMITTEE FOUND 
IS HELD UP, AND THEN SOME. 
THE MAIN THING FOR ME IS THAT 
YOU NEED TO GO TO THE FBI AND 
YOU NEED TO ASK THEM, DID THEY 
FEEL LIKE THEY WERE ABLE TO DO 
THEIR JOB WITHOUT INTERFERENCE? 
I THINK THE ANSWER IS, YES. 
THEY INTERVIEWED OVER 150 
PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF 
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S LIFE. 
TO THOSE WHO SUGGEST THAT HE 
HAD A PROBLEM LIKE THIS FROM 
PRIOR INTERVIEWS, THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE OF THAT. 
THAT IS ALL MANUFACTURED. 
THE SENATORS WHO REQUESTED THE 
SUPPLEMENTAL FBI BACKGROUND 
CHECK GOT WHAT THEY REQUESTED. 
AND I AM READY TO VOTE. 
>> Reporter: ARE YOU CONFIDENT 
THAT THE SENATORS YOU MENTIONED 
-- 
>> YOU NEED TO TALK TO THEM. 
I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE 
SUPPLEMENTAL FBI BACKGROUND 
CHECK WAS DONE PROFESSIONALLY. 
WAS DONE WITHOUT INTERFERENCE. 
AND IT VALIDATED, IN MY VIEW, 
WHERE WE ARE. 
BUT YOU NEED TO TALK TO THEM. 
THE IDEA OF THE FBI LOOKING AT 
THE COMMITTEE'S WORK PRODUCT 
MADE SOME SENSE. 
I DID NOT NEED IT, BUT IT IS 
DONE AND IT PUTS A STAMP ON IT. 
IT IS DIFFERENT THAN IT WAS 
BEFORE. 
WE NEED TO GO TO THESE THREE 
WHO IN GOOD FAITH TRIED TO FIND 
OUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE AND WHAT 
IS BEST FOR THE COUNTRY. 
150+ PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
INTERVIEWED. I HAVE PERSONALLY 
KNOWN HIM FOR 20 YEARS. 
NOT A CLOSE FRIEND, BUT A 
PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP. 
THE BRETT KAVANAUGH THAT I KNEW 
BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IS THE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH THAT I KNOW 
NOW. 
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS AN 
EFFORT TO RUIN THIS MAN'S LIFE. 
>> ALL RIGHT, YOU JUST HEARD 
FROM SENATOR GRAHAM. 
LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO CBS LEGAL 
ANALYST RICKY KLEEMAN. 
ALL ALONG WE HAVE BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT THIS OVER THE LAST COUPLE 
OF DAYS, AS TO THIS FBI INQUIRY,
WHICH IS NOT AN INVESTIGATION. 
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SUBPOENA 
POWER. 
THEY CAN'T COMPEL ANYONE TO 
COME FORWARD. 
>> THEY ARE TRYING TO COME TO A 
CONCLUSION, THEY ARE JUST 
PRESENTING INFORMATION. 
>> RIGHT. 
IT IS TO BE EXPECTED I GUESS 
THAT SOME DEMOCRATS WILL SAY 
THAT WHAT THEY SAW IN THE 
REPORT SUGGESTS SOMETHING THAT 
REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING IS NOT 
THERE. 
>> I THINK YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY 
RIGHT. 
I THINK THAT BOTH SIDES HAVE 
GONE TO THE BATTLEFIELD, IF YOU 
WILL, AND THAT THEY WENT IN 
BELIEVING ONE THING AND THEY 
ARE COMING OUT BELIEVING THE 
SAME THING. 
IF YOU GO INTO SOMETHING AND 
YOU ARE LOOKING FOR 
CONFIRMATION OF YOUR OWN 
BELIEFS, CERTAINLY THE 
REPUBLICANS ARE EASILY ABLE TO 
SAY, LOOK, DEMOCRATS WANTED 
THIS INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI. 
THEY GOT IT. 
IT SHOWS NOTHING THAT WE DIDN'T 
KNOW A WEEK AGO TODAY. 
THE DEMOCRATS ON THE OTHER HAND 
ARE SAYING, WAIT A MINUTE. 
THE INVESTIGATION WE GOT WAS 
NOT THE ONE WE THOUGHT WE WERE 
GOING TO GET. 
SO THEIR POSITION HAS NOT 
CHANGED. 
ULTIMATELY WE ARE COMING DOWN 
TO THE VOTES OF THREE SENATORS, 
COLLINS, MURKOWSKI, AND FLAKE, 
AND PERHAPS IN ADDITION TO JOE 
MANCHIN, ANOTHER SENATOR ON THE 
DEMOCRATIC SIDE, RUNNING IN A 
RED STATE. 
SO NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN A 
WEEK. 
IT IS JUST THAT THE STAKES SEEM 
TO HAVE GOTTEN HIGHER. 
>> THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS 
THAT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT 
THIS INVESTIGATION OR PROBE OR 
ENHANCED BACKGROUND CHECK 
REALLY WAS ABOUT. 
WE KNOW THAT THE WHITE HOUSE 
DETERMINED WHAT THE SCOPE OF IT 
WAS GOING TO BE. 
THERE WAS A SUGGESTION THAT IT 
WOULD BE LIMITED TO CHRISTINE 
BLASEY FORD'S ACCUSATIONS, BUT 
WE FOUND OUT THEY NEVER SPOKE 
TO HER OR JUDGE KAVANAUGH, BUT 
THEY SPOKE TO ANOTHER ACCUSER 
ABOUT HER ACCUSATIONS ABOUT HIM 
EXPOSING HIMSELF AT A PARTY 
WHILE THEY WERE STUDENTS AT 
YALE. 
THEN, ACCORDING TO HER, NEVER 
SPOKE TO ANY OF HER WITNESSES. 
THERE WERE NINE PEOPLE THE FBI 
SPOKE TO. 
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHO THEY WOULD 
BE, BECAUSE WE CAN'T REALLY 
FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY WERE 
LOOKING INTO. 
>> THE THEORY WOULD'VE BEEN 
THAT THEY WERE LOOKING INTO THE 
ACCUSATIONS OF DOCTOR FORD AND 
WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS 
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE, WHICH 
APPARENTLY THERE WAS NOT. 
I DON'T SEE WHY ANYONE EXPECTED 
THERE TO BE ON THE BASIS THAT 
THE WITNESSES WHO DOCTOR FORD 
HAD TALKED ABOUT WERE PEOPLE 
WHO DID NOT REMEMBER THE EVENT. 
THE FACT THAT THEY WENT ON TO 
THE SECOND ACCUSER, DEBORAH 
RAMIREZ, WHICH I THINK THEY 
SHOULD HAVE DONE, BUT THEY 
SHOULD HAVE GONE ON TO THE 
THIRD ACCUSER, JULIE SWETNICK. 
NO MATTER WHAT THE PRESIDENT OR 
OTHERS HAVE SAID ABOUT HER, 
JUST TO CLEAR THE AIR. 
THE BEST THING ABOUT AN FBI 
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION IS 
THAT IT SHOULD FIND NOTHING 
THAT WOULD PREVENT SOMEONE FROM 
BECOMING A SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE OR A FEDERAL COURT 
JUDGE, WHICH JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
ALREADY IS. 
IF ANYONE SHOULD WELCOME THE 
FBI INVESTIGATION, IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN JUDGE KAVANAUGH, IF 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH REALLY BELIEVED 
THAT IT WOULD SHOW THAT HE HAD 
NOTHING TO HIDE AND THAT HE WAS 
WELL QUALIFIED TO TAKE THIS JOB 
AND NO ONE WOULD SAY ANYTHING 
DIFFERENT THAN THAT, BY VIRTUE 
OF CORROBORATING ANY OF THESE 
WOMEN. 
BUT I ASSUME, THOUGH I HATE TO 
SAY THIS, I ASSUME WE ARE GOING 
TO FIND OUT A LOT ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENED IN THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION, BECAUSE NO 
MATTER WHAT EFFORTS THE 
INSTRUCTIONS ARE, TO BE ABLE TO 
KEEP THIS ALL CONFIDENTIAL, THE 
IDEA OF ONE COPY. 
THE IDEA THAT IT CAN'T BE 
SHARED. 
THE IDEA OF HAVING SENATORS 
READ IT, ONE BY ONE OR IN 
GROUPS, IN ORDER TO NOT HAVE 
ANYTHING ABOUT IT GO OUT INTO 
THE PUBLIC. 
I DO BELIEVE THAT I MAY WORK 
FOR CBS NEWS AS A LEGAL 
ANALYST, BUT I CERTAINLY 
BELIEVE, BOTH AS A LAWYER AND 
IN THE WORLD OF JOURNALISM, 
THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT 
SHOULD NOT BE LEAKED. 
I KNOW THAT MAYBE CONTRARY TO 
WHAT SOME MEDIA MAY WANT, BUT I 
DO HAVE A STRONG FEELING ABOUT 
LEAKS. 
YOU KNOW THIS WILL GET LEAKED. 
THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND 
ABOUT IT. 
>> ALL RIGHT, WE WILL CHECK IN 
WITH YOU IN JUST A BIT, BECAUSE 
I THINK WE HAVE SENATOR CORY 
BOOKER MAKING SOME COMMENTS 
ABOUT THIS. 
LET'S LISTEN. 
>> THE PERSON MAKING AN 
ALLEGATION HAS GIVEN YOU A LIST 
OF PEOPLE THAT EITHER SAW THAT 
WORK COULD CORROBORATE WHAT SHE 
SAID. 
DID YOU INTERVIEW ALL OF THOSE 
PEOPLE? 
IF THE ANSWER IS NO, WHAT KIND 
OF INVESTIGATION IS THIS? 
THEY ALWAYS HAD THE NUMBERS. 
TO RAM THIS THROUGH. 
CLEARLY THAT SEEMS LIKE WHAT 
THEY WILL NOW TRY TO DO AND I 
HOPE THAT PEOPLE OF GOOD 
CONSCIENCE ASK THE SAME 
QUESTIONS I AM ASKING, WHICH IS,
WHY DIDN'T YOU COMPLETE THIS 
INVESTIGATION? 
WHY DIDN'T YOU INTERVIEW 
RELATIVE TO -- INTERVIEW THE 
RELEVANT PEOPLE TO THIS? 
>> OKAY, SO SENATOR CORY BOOKER 
WAS BASICALLY ASKING THE PRESS, 
BECAUSE HE KNOWS IT WILL BE 
PLAYED ACROSS ALL MEDIA OUTLETS 
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS, 
THE QUESTION THAT HE WANTS OUT 
THERE. 
THAT IS, WHY ISN'T THIS 
INVESTIGATION MORE THOROUGH? 
TO USE THE LANGUAGE THE 
DEMOCRATS ARE USING. 
WHY DIDN'T THEY INTERVIEW MORE 
WITNESSES? 
WE KNOW THEY INTERVIEWED 
DEBORAH RAMIREZ, BUT THEY DID 
NOT INTERVIEW THE PEOPLE SHE 
SAYS COULD CORROBORATE HER 
VERSION OF THE ALLEGATION THAT 
SHE HAS MADE. 
WHY? 
>> WELL, WE DON'T KNOW WHY. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR 
INSTRUCTIONS WERE. 
THAT IS PART OF THE PROBLEM. 
THE FBI, WHICH I HAVE ENORMOUS 
RESPECT FOR. 
I GO BACK FOR THE 20 YEARS I 
PRACTICED LAW ON BOTH SIDES, AS 
A PROSECUTOR AND A DEFENDER, I 
HAVE ENORMOUS RESPECT FOR THE 
FBI AND ALSO FOR THE LENGTHY 
PERIOD OF TIME I HAVE BEEN 
COVERING CASES INVOLVING THEM. 
YES, WE HAVE SEEN THE FBI IN 
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, UNDER 
THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY 
CRITICISM, SOME OF IT FOR GOOD 
REASON AND OTHERS NOT SO GOOD, 
AND WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK, I 
BELIEVE, SOME POINT, 
CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS. 
CHRISTOPHER WRAY WILL HAVE TO 
COME DOWN AND EXPLAIN WHY HIS 
AGENTS DID WHAT THEY WERE TOLD, 
I ASSUME, AND DID NOT GO BEYOND 
THE SCOPE OF WHAT THEIR 
INSTRUCTIONS WERE. 
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER, ONE OF 
THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE FORGET 
IS THAT THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL 
INVESTIGATION. 
THIS IS A BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATION. 
THE TWO ARE VERY, VERY DIFFERENT
IN SCOPE. 
WHATEVER THE SCOPE IS IN THIS 
ONE, WE DON'T KNOW. 
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS VERY 
NARROW, DESPITE A LOT OF REPORTS
IN THE MEDIA THAT IT LOOKED 
LIKE IT WAS GOING TO BE BIG OR 
THAT CERTAINLY YOU AND I AND 
ALL OF OUR VIEWERS WERE 
LISTENING FROM TIME TO TIME AS 
THE PRESIDENT SAID THE FBI WAS 
UNFETTERED TO DO WHATEVER IT 
NEEDED TO DO. 
IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE FBI 
WAS VERY CIRCUMSCRIBED, HERE. 
THAT IS, IT WAS ONLY SUPPOSED 
TO SEE CERTAIN PEOPLE UP TO A 
CERTAIN POINT. 
I WANT TO MAKE ONE LAST POINT 
ON THIS. 
THERE ARE MANY, MANY PEOPLE, 
INCLUDING THE ATTORNEYS FOR 
DOCTOR FORD, WHO ARE IN THE 
WORLD OF SAYING, OF COURSE THIS 
WAS ALL ABOUT DOCTOR FORD'S 
ALLEGATIONS AND THEY DID NOT 
EVEN GO SEE HER. 
WELL, I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DID 
NOT GO SEE HER. 
SHE HAD TESTIFIED TO CONGRESS, 
AND TO THE WORLD, IF YOU WILL, 
FOR MANY HOURS LAST THURSDAY 
AND THERE WAS HER LETTER AND 
OTHER STATEMENTS. 
THEY HAD A LOT FROM DOCTOR FORD.
THE QUESTION REALLY WAS, TO ME, 
WHY DIDN'T THEY GO SEE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AFTER THEY GOT 
WHATEVER THEY GOT FROM OTHER 
WITNESSES. THAT THEY DID NEED 
TO GO VISIT BRETT KAVANAUGH AND 
INTERVIEW HIM AT THE END. 
THAT WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE TO 
ME. 
GOING BACK TO DOCTOR FORD, I 
UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DID NOT. 
>> SO WE KNOW SENATORS ARE NOT 
SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT THE 
CONTENTS OF THE DOCUMENT, BUT 
AS WE MOE FORWARD TOWARD THE 
SMOKE, THERE WILL BE A LOT OF 
SPEECHMAKING, PERHAPS A LITTLE 
GRANDSTANDING. 
WHAT SORT OF RISK WOULD 
SENATORS FACE IF, PERHAPS IN A 
PARTICULARLY PASSIONATE SPEECH, 
THEY RELEASED INFORMATION THAT 
WAS IN THIS DOCUMENT? 
>> THEY HAVE AN ETHICAL AND 
LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY TO NOT 
RELEASE WHAT IS IN THAT 
DOCUMENT. 
AND THEY KNOW THAT. 
DO I EXPECT SOME SENATORS TO BE 
PROSECUTED FOR LEAKING THIS 
INFORMATION? 
HIGHLY UNLIKELY. 
BUT THE REALITY IS THAT YOU 
OUGHT TO ACT ACCORDING TO YOUR 
ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES. 
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, RIKKI 
KLIEMAN, WE APPRECIATE YOU 
TALKING TO US. 
WE WILL PROBABLY  TAP INTO YOUR 
EXPERTISE IN THE FUTURE. 
THANK YOU. 
>> OKAY, I AM READY. 
>> THE FBI INVESTIGATION MAY BE 
OVER, BUT AS YOU POINTED OUT 
ANNE-MARIE, THERE WILL BE  A 
LOT OF GRANDSTANDING ON BOTH 
SIDES OF THE AISLE. 
I THINK FOR FOLKS OUT THERE WHO 
ARE NOT IN THE BUBBLE, THE 
MEDIA BUBBLE OR THE WASHINGTON 
BUBBLE, THE ONE THING I HOPE WE 
DO NOT LOSE SIGHT OF IS THAT 
THERE IS A WOMAN WHO SAYS 
SOMETHING REALLY TERRIBLE 
HAPPENED TO HER BACK IN 1982 
AND TWO SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY'S 
POINT, THERE IS A MAN WHO SAYS 
HE HAS BEEN WRONGLY ACCUSED, 
BUT HIS ENTIRE FAMILY HAS GONE 
THROUGH THIS ORDEAL WITH HIM. 
IT WILL REQUIRE FOLKS TO TAKE A 
STEP BACK AND REASSESS A LOT OF 
THINGS BUT I HOPE THAT IS NOT 
LOST IN ALL OF THIS. 
YOU KNOW, GAMESMANSHIP. 
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. 
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE HOUSE, THE 
MIDTERMS, ALL THAT STUFF. 
THE WHITE HOUSE DOES SAY THAT 
IT DOES HAVE THE VOTES. 
IT IS CONFIDENT THAT IT DOES 
HAVE THE VOTES TO CONFIRM BRETT 
KAVANAUGH TO THE SUPREME COURT, 
AFTER REVIEWING THAT FBI REPORT.
HOW DO WE KNOW THAT? 
THERE IS A TWEET. 
THE PRESIDENT IN A TWEET 
EARLIER TODAY WROTE THIS. 
THE HARSH, UNFAIR TREATMENT OF 
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH IS HAVING 
AN INCREDIBLE UPWARD IMPACT ON 
VOTERS. 
THE PEOPLE GET IT FAR BETTER 
THAN THE POLITICIANS. 
MORE IMPORTANTLY, THIS GREAT 
LIFE CANNOT BE RUINED BY MEAN 
AND DESPICABLE DEMOCRATS AND 
TOTALLY UNCORROBORATED 
ALLEGATIONS. 
>> THE SINGLE DOCUMENT WAS 
DELIVERED OVERNIGHT TO THE 
SENATE. 
THE FINAL VOTE IS PLANNED FOR 
SATURDAY. 
ALL 100 SENATORS AND A HANDFUL 
OF STAFF HAVE BEGUN TO REVIEW 
THE REPORT. 
WE HAVE MORE ON THE RESPONSE 
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. 
THE PRESS SECRETARY SAYS THAT 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS 
BEEN TALKING TO SENATORS WHO 
REMAIN ON THE FENCE. 
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT 
THOSE CONVERSATIONS? 
>> Reporter: HE SAYS THE WHITE 
HOUSE HAS BEEN IN VERY CLOSE 
CONTACT WITH THESE SENATORS, 
LOBBYING THEM, TRYING TO TALK 
TO THEM MORE ABOUT THE FACTS 
AND NOT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER 
NOISE THAT HAS IMPACTED THIS 
CONFIRMATION HEARING. 
THERE CERTAINLY IS A LOT OF 
THAT. 
AND RAJ SHAH, EVEN THOUGH HE 
EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT 
SENATORS CAN VOTE COMFORTABLY, 
THEY HAVEN'T TAKEN A TALLY OF 
THE VOTES SINCE THIS REPORT 
CAME OUT, SO THEY CAN'T SAY FOR 
SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE MAGIC 
NUMBER THEY NEED TO PUSH THIS 
JUDGE THROUGH. 
HE SAYS BASED ON THE FINDINGS 
OF THIS REPORT, THAT HE SEES NO 
REASON WHY THOSE GOP SENATORS 
WOULD NOT VOTE YES. 
WE PRESSED HIM ABOUT WHY? 
WHY ARE YOU SO CONFIDENT? 
WHAT DID THE FINDINGS TELL US 
AND WILL YOU SHARE THAT WITH 
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC? 
HE WAS VERY GUARDED TO SAY 
THERE ARE PRIVACY ACTS IN 
PLACE, RULES IN PLACE THAT 
PREVENT HIM FROM TALKING TOO 
MUCH AND CHARACTERIZING WHAT 
THE FBI HAS FOUND, BUT HE 
MAINTAINS, TAKE IT FROM HIM, 
THEY DID NOT FIND SOMETHING 
THAT SHOULD CAUSE WORRY FOR THE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING THIS HUGE 
DECISION. 
>> THAT IS THE LAST THING A 
FREE AND FAIR PRESS WILL EVER 
DO, JUST TAKE IT AT THE WORD OF 
A WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY. 
IS THIS CONSIDERED STANDARD NOT 
TO RELEASE THIS INFORMATION TO 
THE PUBLIC? 
>> Reporter: IT IS. 
EVEN THOUGH THIS BACKGROUND 
INFORMATION IS NOT MARKED AS 
TOP-SECRET OR CLASSIFIED, IT IS 
CUSTOMARY FOR IT TO REMAIN 
CONFIDENTIAL. 
SO, IN THE FUTURE, THIS PROCESS 
CAN CONTINUE. 
IT IS A LONG PROCESS. 
WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY OTHER 
NOMINEES, IN ORDER TO GET TO 
THE HEART OF WHAT KIND OF JUDGE 
THEY WOULD BE. 
HOW THEY WOULD SERVE. 
JUST BECAUSE IT IS NOT GOING TO 
OFFICIALLY BECOME PUBLIC DOES 
NOT MEAN WE DO NOT EXPECT TO 
SEE IT. 
SO, IF THERE ARE LEAKS, THAT IS 
CERTAINLY ONE WAY, THE ONLY WAY 
THAT WE WILL. 
THAT IS NOT OUT OF THE 
QUESTION. 
IN FACT, I PREDICT WE WILL BE 
SEEING THAT. 
THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A 
CONTENTIOUS PROCESS, THAT 
THOSE, ESPECIALLY IN FAVOR OF 
CAVANAGH, WILL WANT THE PUBLIC 
TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE FBI 
FOUND AND THOSE SENATORS, 
PERHAPS YOU END UP VOTING YES, 
WILL WANT TO JUSTIFY THEIR 
DECISION. 
>> THAT IS THE POINT. 
IT MAY NOT BE STANDARD 
PROCEDURE TO RELEASE IT TO THE 
PUBLIC, BUT WHOEVER LEAKS, IT 
IS GOING TO BE SELF-SERVING, SO 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD NEVER 
REALLY KNOW. 
>> THIS LIMITED EXPOSURE TO 
THIS DOCUMENT IS AN ATTEMPT TO 
LIMIT THE LEAKS, BUT SENATOR 
GRASSLEY ALREADY RELEASED A 
STATEMENT AND YOU KNOW SOMEONE 
WILL TRY TO ISSUE A REBUTTAL. 
I WILL GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF 
LINES OUT OF GRASSLEY'S 
STATEMENT, WHICH IS, THERE IS 
NOTHING IN IT WE DIDN'T ALREADY 
KNOW. 
THESE UNCORROBORATED 
ALLEGATIONS HAVE BEEN 
UNEQUIVOCALLY AND REPEATEDLY 
REJECTED BY JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 
NEITHER THE COMMITTEE NOR THE 
FBI COULD LOCATE ANY THIRD 
PARTIES WHO COULD ATTEST TO ANY 
OF THE ALLEGATIONS. 
SO, A LITTLE WINDOW INTO WHAT 
THAT DOCUMENT MIGHT SAY. 
I AM SURE THERE WILL BE AT 
LEAST ONE LEAK ON THE OTHER 
SIDE, RESPONDING. 
>> YOU THINK? 
>> Reporter: A LEAK AND ALSO 
PUSHBACK BY THE DEMOCRATS WHO 
SAY IT IS UNFAIR FOR YOU TO 
DRAW THIS CONCLUSION, BECAUSE 
THEY WILL ARGUE THIS 
INVESTIGATION WAS UNFAIR, 
BECAUSE IT WAS SO LIMITED IN 
TIME AND SCOPE. 
IN FACT THERE WAS A NEW ARTICLE 
THAT DROPPED IN THE NEW YORKER 
THAT SAID THERE WERE SEVERAL 
PEOPLE WHO CONTACTED THE FBI, 
BECAUSE THEY WANTED TO 
CORROBORATE THAT SECOND 
ACCUSERS STORY, BUT THEY WERE 
NEVER CONTACTED IN RETURN. 
SO THEY COULD NOT SHARE THE 
INFORMATION THAT THEY HAD. 
SO, I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL 
BE A MARK, BECAUSE THE 
DEMOCRATS WILL CONTINUE TO SAY, 
EVEN THOUGH YOU MIGHT NOT OF 
FOUND CORROBORATION, THAT IS 
BECAUSE THE PROCESS WAS UNFAIR 
AND YOU DID NOT LOOK FOR IT IN 
THE WAY WE WOULD'VE WANTED YOU 
TO. 
ONE THING ASIDE, ONE THING THAT 
ROZ SHAW DID ACKNOWLEDGE, HE 
DOES SAY THAT HE DOES BELIEVE 
THIS WILL HAVE A LASTING IMPACT 
ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S REPUTATION 
AND HIS SERVICE ON THE COURT. 
HE SAID IT WAS AN UGLY PROCESS 
AND HE WORRIES THIS COULD 
JEOPARDIZE OTHER NOMINEES IN 
THE FUTURE AND WHAT THEY MAY 
HAVE TO GO THROUGH. 
HE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT REGARDLESS 
OF THE OUTCOME, THIS WILL BE A 
CHAPTER IN HISTORY THAT REALLY 
DEFINES THE PRESIDENT'S LEGACY, 
IN TERMS OF SETTING THE COURT. 
>> YOU KNOW, -- 
>> AND THE PROCESS. 
>> THE PRESIDENT TWEETED ABOUT 
THE PROCESS AND SAID, THIS IS 
AN IMPORTANT TIME IN OUR 
COUNTRY. 
DUE PROCESS AND COMMON SENSE 
ARE NOW IN TRIAL. 
I KNOW THAT YOU AND OTHER -- 
ARE NOW ON TRIAL. 
I KNOW THAT YOU AND OTHER PRESS 
CORPS MEMBERS HAVE PRESSED 
SARAH SANDERS AND THE 
ADMINISTRATION TO UNDERSTAND 
WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD A 
DIFFERENT STANDARD WHEN HE WAS 
A PRIVATE CITIZEN, SPECIFICALLY 
WHEN IT CAME TO THE CENTRAL 
PARK FIVE, AND WHY HE SEEMS TO 
HAVE A MUCH DIFFERENT STANDARD 
AS PRESIDENT. 
I KNOW YOU WILL KEEP DIGGING ON 
THAT, BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS 
RELEVANT TO THE DISCUSSIONS WE 
ARE HAVING NOW. 
THIS IS NOT A COURT OF LAW. 
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SENATE 
WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH, THE 
STANDARDS ARE NOT THE SAME AS 
IT WOULD BE IN A COURT OF LAW, 
AND THE PRESIDENT IS TWEETING 
AS IF IT SHOULD BE, MIXING UP 
POLITICAL AND LEGAL TERMS ALL 
AT ONCE. 
THERE IS A HISTORY THERE THAT 
HAS TO BE EXAMINED. 
WEIJIA, WE APPRECIATE IT  AS 
ALWAYS. 
>> SURE, THANK YOU. 
>>> HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN 
ANOTHER AREA OF THE CAPITAL, 
THIS IS THE DC DISTRICT COURT. 
PROTESTERS HAVE AMASSED. 
WE SHOULD CALL THEM 
DEMONSTRATORS, BECAUSE THERE 
ARE MANY PEOPLE AGAINST THE 
APPOINTMENT OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
AND THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE THAT 
ARE SUPPORTERS IN THE CROWD. 
THEIR PLAN IS TO START HERE AND 
THEN MARCH TOWARD THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
WE HEARD, MAYBE 30 SECONDS AGO, 
SOME OF THEM YELLING SHAME TO 
SOMEONE. 
WE ALSO HEARD A HEATED BACK AND 
FORTH GOING ON BETWEEN A 
SUPPORTER OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
AND SOMEONE AGAINST HIM. 
>> THERE ARE A COUPLE OF 
PEOPLE, AS YOU POINTED OUT, 
THAT ARE SUPPORTERS OF JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH AND PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
I SAW HIM ON -- I SAW ONE MAN 
ARGUING WITH A TRUMP T-SHIRT 
ON. 
THE DISCUSSION APPEARED CORDIAL.
WE COULD NOT HEAR IT OVER OUR 
EARPIECES, BUT IT APPEARED 
CORDIAL, WHICH IS PART OF HOW 
DEBATES IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE 
ALWAYS OCCURRED. 
PEOPLE HAVE OPPOSING SIDES AND 
HOPEFULLY IT STAYS ORDERLY AND 
RESPECTFUL AND PEOPLE ARE 
RESPECTFUL OF EACH OTHER'S 
POINTS OF VIEW AND OPINIONS. 
THAT IS THE SCENE RIGHT NOW. 
AS YOU POINTED OUT, THEY WILL 
WALK TO THE SUPREME COURT. 
THAT IS THE PLAN AS THEY 
CONTINUE TO AMASS. 
RIGHT NOW THEY ARE OUTSIDE THE 
FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT. 
WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THIS 
DEMONSTRATION AS WE LOOK AHEAD 
TO THIS WEEKEND, WHERE WE 
BELIEVE A CONFIRMATION VOTE FOR 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, DEPENDING ON 
HOW THOSE KEY SENATORS -- 
COLLINS, FLAKE, MURKOWSKI -- 
HOW THEY ARE REACTING TO THIS 
NEW FBI REPORT THAT ONLY THE 
SENATORS AND KEY STAFF MEMBERS 
CAN HAVE ACCESS TO. 
WE KNOW SENATOR COLLINS HAS 
SAID IT IS VERY THOROUGH. 
>>> WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A 
BREAK. 
>>> THERE IS MOUNTING 
DEVASTATION IN INDONESIA, WHERE 
MORE THAN 1420 PEOPLE HAVE DIED 
FOLLOWING LAST FRIDAY'S 
EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI. 
MILITARY TROOPS ARE HELPING 
EVACUATE FAMILIES AND PROVIDE 
AID TO HARD-HIT AREAS. 
>> THOUSANDS ARE NOW HOMELESS 
AFTER THE QUAKE AND TSUNAMI 
DESTROYED MILES OF HOMES AND 
BUSINESSES. 
BEN TRACY HAS THE LATEST. 
>> Reporter: NEARLY 75,000 
PEOPLE HERE ARE NOW HOMELESS. 
THERE IS NO DRINKING WATER, NO 
ELECTRICITY, AND NO WHERE TO 
BUY FOOD. 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR 
HELP TO ARRIVE. 
THE INDONESIAN MILITARY IS 
FINALLY HERE WITH AN ARMY OF 
SUPPLIES. 
BOXES OF WATER, INSTANT NOODLES 
AND GIANT SEX FULL OF CLOTHES. 
ALL OF IT IS DESPERATELY NEEDED 
AT THE MANY MAKESHIFT HOMELESS 
CAMPS THAT HAVE SPRUNG UP ALL 
OVER THE DISASTER ZONE. 
THIS WOMAN HAS BEEN HERE WITH 
HER 1-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER FOR SIX 
DAYS. 
A TENT IS THEIR ONLY PROTECTION 
FROM 90 DEGREE HEAT. 
THEY HAVE HAD TO DRINK WATER 
FROM THE NEARBY RIVER, WHICH IS 
ALSO BEING USED AS A TOILET. 
>> Reporter: DO YOU HAVE ANY 
IDEA HOW LONG YOU WILL BE HERE? 
SHE SAYS, I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO 
GO. 
I NO LONGER HAVE A HOME. 
HER HOME WAS WIPED OUT BY THE 
TSUNAMI, TRIGGERED BY THE 7.5 
MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE LAST 
FRIDAY. 
THE SCARS ON HER FACE ARE FROM 
BEING ROLLED BY THE TSUNAMI 
WAVES. 
SHE SAYS, IT IS A MIRACLE THAT 
WE FOUND HER ALIVE. 
I THANK GOD THAT SHE HAS A NEW 
LIFE. 
WHILE WE WERE AT THE HOMELESS 
CAMP, WE ALSO SAW THIS MAN 
WALKING AROUND, WEARING A SIGN. 
IT BASICALLY SAYS, I AM LOOKING 
FOR MY WIFE AND SON. 
HE TOLD ME HE HAS NOT SEEN 
EITHER OF THEM SINCE THE 
EARTHQUAKE HAPPENED SIX DAYS 
AGO. 
HE IS HOLDING OUT HOPE THAT 
THEY MAY STILL BE ALIVE. 
BUT THIS IS WHAT HIS 
NEIGHBORHOOD NOW LOOKS LIKE. 
EVERY SINGLE HOME REDUCE THE 
PILES OF CHARRED DEBRIS. 
WE ARE TOLD MORE THAN 700 HOMES 
WERE DESTROYED HERE DURING THE 
EARTHQUAKE. 
THERE IS NOW SO MUCH DEBRIS 
HERE AND SO LITTLE TO MOVE IT 
WITH THAT IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE 
HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE FOR THEM 
TO FIND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
LIKELY BURIED HERE. 
SADLY THEY EXPECT TO FIND MANY 
MORE VICTIMS. 
THE CITY HOLD A MASS BURIAL 
EVERY DAY AND JUST DUG IT 
SECOND MASS GRAVE. 
BEN TRACY, CBS NEWS, INDONESIA.
