>> HELLO WEST VIRGINIA, HELLO. 
WHAT A GREAT SONG. 
HOW GOOD IS THAT SONG?  
    
I AM THRILLED TO BE BACK IN 
THIS INCREDIBLE STATE WITH 
THOUSANDS OF HARD WORKING 
AMERICAN PATRIOTS. 
THANK YOU, THANK YOU. 
THE PEOPLE OF WEST VIRGINIA 
LOVE OUR COUNTRY. 
THEY HONOR OUR HISTORY AND THEY 
ALWAYS RESPECT OUR GREAT 
AMERICAN FLAG.    
THIS IS TRULY AN AMAZING TIME 
FOR OUR NATION. 
OUR ECONOMY IS BOOMING LIKE 
NEVER BEFORE. 
REMEMBER I TOLD YOU.    
BY THE WAY YOUR STATE IS 
BOOMING LIKE NEVER BEFORE.    
POVERTY IS PLUMMETING, OUR 
STOCK MARKET IS SOARING, 
REACHING UNDER THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES ALL-TIME HIGH BY 
THE WAY -- REACHING UNDER THE 
ALL-TIME HIGHS. 
ALL-TIME HIGH. 
AND OUR GREAT COALMINERS ARE 
BACK TO WORK. 
THEY'RE BACK TO WORK. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID THAT 
WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN BACK TO 
WORK. 
NOT ONLY BACK TO WORK, BUT 
THEY'RE OPENING UP MINES ALL 
OVER THE PLACE. 
WE'RE OPENING UP STEEL MILLS 
AND THE STEEL MILLS NEED A CALL 
AND THOSE COALMINERS ARE 
WORKING AND THE STEEL WORKERS 
ARE WORKING AND OUR WHOLE 
COUNTRY IS WORKING. 
WE'RE TAKING CARE OF OUR 
VETERANS AND OUR MILITARY WILL 
SOON BE MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER 
BEFORE.    
AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN. 
AND AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN. 
I JUST LEFT THE UNITED NATIONS. 
BELIEVE ME, THEY RESPECT US NOW 
AGAIN. 
THEY ALL RESPECT US. 
WHAT ARE WE DOING? 
WE'RE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST 
FINALLY. 
BUT A LOT OF WHAT WE'VE DONE, 
SOME PEOPLE COULD SAY ALL OF 
WHAT WE'VE DONE IS AT STAKE IN 
NOVEMBER. 
ALWAYS FRAGILE. 
WE ARE JUST FIVE WEEKS AWAY 
FROM ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 
CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS IN OUR 
LIFETIMES. 
THIS IS ONE OF THE BIG, BIG, IN 
OTHER WORDS, THAT'S TRUE, I'M 
NOT RUNNING, BUT I'M REALLY 
RUNNING. 
THAT'S WHY I'M ALL OVER THE 
PLACE FIGHTING FOR GREAT 
CANDIDATES. 
I'M FIGHTING FOR GREAT 
CANDIDATES.    
YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. 
YOU SEE THIS HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE 
RADICAL GROUP OF DEMOCRATS. 
YOU SEE IT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. 
   
AND THEY'RE DETERMINED TO TAKE 
BACK POWER BY USING ANY MEANS 
NECESSARY. 
YOU SEE THE MEANNESS, THE 
NASTINESS. 
THEY DON'T CARE WHO THEY HURT.  
WHO THEY HAVE TO RUN OVER IN 
ORDER TO GET POWER AND CONTROL. 
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT IS POWER 
AND CONTROL. 
WE ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE IT TO 
THEM. 
WE WILL KEEP IT RUNNING THE WAY 
IT HAS BEEN RUNNING. 
WHILE REPUBLICANS ARE FIGHTING 
EVERY DAY FOR JOBS, SAFETY, 
OPPORTUNITY, LACK OF CRIME. 
WITH THEM IT'S CRIME, OPEN 
BORDERS. 
THEY HAVE BEEN ON A MISSION TO 
RESIST AND OBSTRUCTAND DESTROY 
AND YOU SEE THAT OVER THE LAST 
FOUR DAYS, YOU SEE IT. 
IT'S UP TO EACH OF YOU WITH 
YOUR FRESHES VOTE. 
IT IS THAT IN 2016. 
WE HAVE THE SAME THING 
HAPPENING, THE SAME THING. 
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE VERY, 
VERY SURPRISED. 
WHEN YOU WIN THE PRESIDENCY IN 
THEORY, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSE TO 
BE GREAT IN THE MIDTERM. 
BECAUSE I WON THE PRESIDENCY. 
>> THANK YOU. 
SO I WON THE PRESIDENCY, WHICH 
IS REALLY WE WON THE 
PRESIDENCY. 
AND WE HAVE THE GREATEST 
ECONOMY THAT THIS NATION HAS 
EVER SEEN. 
JOBS, EVERYTHING ELSE. 
SO WE WON AND WE HAVE SO MANY 
THINGS HAPPENING THAT ARE SO 
GOOD. 
SO WE SHOULD DO WELL IN THE 
MIDTERMS. 
I CANNOT IMAGINE. 
BUT DON'T BE COMPLACENT. 
THE ONE THING THAT COULD HAPPEN 
AND A BEAUTIFUL THING THAT'S 
GOING ON OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS 
IN THE SENATE WHEN YOU SEE THE 
ANGER, WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE THAT 
ARE ANGRY, MEAN, NASTY, 
UNTRUTHFUL. 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT RELEASES AND 
LEAKS AND THEN THEY SAY OH, I 
DIDN'T DO IT. 
I DIDN'T DO IT.    
REMEMBER? 
DIANNE FEINSTEIN, DID YOU LEAK? 
   
REMEMBER HER ANSWER. 
DID YOU LEAK THE DOCUMENT? 
WHAT?    
NO. 
NO, I DIDN'T LEAK. 
WELL, WAIT ONE MINUTE, DID WE 
LEAK? 
OH, NO, NO WE DIDN'T LEAK IT. 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THAT WAS 
REALLY BAD BODY LANGUAGE, WHO 
KNOWS, BUT THAT WAS THE WORST 
BODY LANGUAGE I'VE EVER SEEN. 
THE ENTIRE NATION HAS WITNESSED 
THE SHAMELESS CONDUCT OF THE 
DEMOCRAT PARTY. 
THEY'RE WILLING TO THROW AWAY 
EVERY STANDARD OF DECENCY, 
JUSTICE, FAIRNESS, AND DUE 
PROCESS, TO GET THEIR WAY. 
THEY DON'T CARE HOW THEY GET 
IT. 
YOU SEE IT HAPPENING BEFORE 
YOUR EYES. 
I THINK IT IS ACTUALLY AN 
INCREDIBLE THING THAT'S 
HAPPENING, AND I JUST HOPE YOU 
DON'T SIT HOME BECAUSE BAD 
THINGS WILL HAPPEN IF YOU SIT 
HOME. 
NOW THE STORY WILL BE ONE 
WACKO, TOMORROW, A MAJOR 
PROTEST IN THE GREAT STATE OF 
WEST VIRGINIA. 
HE OR SHE, I COULDN'T TELL FROM 
THE BACK. 
BUT LET'S SAY IT WAS SHE WAS 
VERY EASY TO GET OUT, RIGHT? 
UT THIS WEEK AMERICA ALSO SAW 
SOMETHING ELSE. 
ON THURSDAY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
SAW THE BRILLIANT AND REALLY 
INCREDIBLE CHARACTER, QUALITY 
AND COURAGE OF OUR NOMINEE FOR 
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT 
A VOTE TO CONFIRM BE JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH IS A VOTE TO CONFIRM 
ONE OF THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED 
LEGAL MINDS OF THEIR TIMES. 
A RECORD OF PUBLIC SERVICE. 
YOU KNOW, FOR TEN YEARS HE'S A 
YOUNG GUY. 
BUT FOR TEN YEARS THEY HAVE 
BEEN TALKING ABOUT HIM. 
LONGER THAN THAT. 
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT HIM, BUT I 
HEARD ABOUT HIM A LOT, ALL 
SAYING HE SHOULD BE ON THE 
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. 
THAT'S WHY I PUT HIM UP.  
AND I WILL TELL YOU, I WILL 
TELL YOU, I WILL TELL YOU HE 
HAS SUFFERED THE MEANNESS, THE 
ANGER.  
AND NOW WEST VIRGINIA, THEY DID 
A POLE, JUST CAME OUT. 
OVERALL TOTAL SUPPORT FOR JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, 58%.    
TOTAL OPPOSED, 28%.    
AND SO IT'S 58%, 28% OPPOSED. 
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD, RIGHT? 
I THINK THAT'S GOOD. 
THAT'S WEST VIRGINIA. 
REPUBLICAN 81% VERSES 8%, BUT 
THAT IS WHAT WE EXPECTED.    
WOW. 
WOMEN, 52% TO 35%.  
THAT'S NOT BAD.    
MEN, WEST VIRGINIA 65% TO 21%. 
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT? 
HEY, IT'S A POLL, BUT WE LOVE 
THOSE POLLS, DON'T WE? 
I LOVE POLLS. 
ONLY WHEN THEY ARE GOOD, WHEN 
THEY ARE NOT GOOD, I WON'T TALK 
ABOUT IT. 
BUT THEY WILL DO A LOT. 
YOU SEE THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA? 
THEY WILL DO A LOT. 
THEY DO A LOT OF PHONY POLLS. 
A LOT OF PHONY POLLS.  
AND THEY DO A LOT OF POLLS, 
SUPPRESSION POLLS. 
THEY WILL MAKE THEM BAD BECAUSE 
WE'RE DOING A LOT OF GOOD WORK, 
BUT THEY MAKE THEM BAD SO YOU 
GO TO A MOVIE INSTEAD OF 
VOTING. 
LET'S GO TO A MOVIE AND THEN 
WE'LL COME HOME AND WATCH THE 
RETURNS. 
BUT -- BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. 
IN 2016 NOBODY WENT TO A MOVIE, 
NOBODY.    
I THINK THE MOVIE THEATERS WERE 
VERY EMPTY THAT NIGHT, DON'T 
YOU THINK? 
SO SOME GREAT THINGS ARE 
HAPPENING. 
BUT A VOTE FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
IS A VOTE TO REJECT THE 
RUTHLESS AND OUTRAGEOUS TACTICS 
OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 
MEAN OBSTRUCTIONISTS, 
RESISTERS. 
FOR THE LAST 18 MONTHS, 
DEMOCRATS HAVE SPENT EVERY 
MINUTE TRYING TO OVERTURN THE 
RESULTS OF THE LAST ELECTION. 
WE HAD ONE OF THE GREAT. 
WE HAD ONE OF THE GREATS. 
EVERY DAY IT'S LIKE A JOB, LIKE 
A PART OF YOUR JOB DESCRIPTION. 
GET UP AND FIGHT THEM.    
GET UP AND FIGHT THEM.    
THEY TRY TO SHUT DOWN OUR 
GOVERNMENT. 
THEY'RE HOLDING UP 360 MEN AND 
WOMEN WHO WANT TO WORK FOR THE 
GOVERNMENT THEY ARE NOT 
APPROVING. 
AND HIGHLY QUALIFIED AND NOT 
EVEN CALLED NOMINEES. 
THEY ARE NOT EVEN 
CONTROVERSIAL. 
YOU KNOW THE WORD SLOW WALKING? 
THEY ARE SLOW WALKING.    
AND THEY LEFT THEIR JOBS.    
SCHUMER AND ALL THE GROUPS THAT 
YOU READ ABOUT.    
THEY ARE NOT ALLOWING THESE 
PEOPLE TO COME INTO GOVERNMENT 
AND I'M NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT 
A PEOPLE WITH A CERTAIN VIEW. 
BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE 
THAT ARE INCLUDING JUDGES WHERE 
THEY GO MAXIMUM 30 DAYS, 30 
DAYS. 
IF SOMEBODY WILL BE APPROVED, 
THEY TAKE THEM. 
WE'RE UP TO 365 PEOPLE AND IT 
HAS BEEN THAT WAY, THE LONGEST 
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY 
BY FAR. 
THE MOST PEOPLE IN THE HISTORY, 
THE LONGEST AND THE MOST IN 
HISTORY. 
HONESTLY THE DEMOCRATS ARE A 
DISPLACE, THEY ARE. 
THEY ARE A DISGRACE.    
AND THE NUMBER ONE ENABLER OF 
THE DEMOCRATS IS THE FAKE NEWS 
MEDIA RIGHT BACK THERE.    
I'LL TELL YOU.     
AND THEY REALLY DO, THEY SHOW 
YOU THE CHAOS AND THE 
RESENTMENT. 
THEY REPORT INCORRECT NEWS, 
PHONY NEWS. 
WHEN I SAY ABOUT MEDIA, I'M 
TALKING ABOUT THE FAKE NEWS 
MEDIA. 
THEY ARE TRULY AN ENEMY OF THE 
PEOPLE. 
FAKE NEWS, ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE. 
THEY REALLY ARE. 
THEY ARE SO BAD.    
YOU DON'T EVEN GET IT. 
YOU THINK THEY WOULD LIKE A 
STRONG MILITARY. 
NO CRIME, STRONG BORDERS.    
THEY DON'T. 
THEY DON'T.    
THIS NOVEMBER 6, YOU'LL HAVE A 
CHANCE TO REJECT THESE 
DISGRACEFUL POLITICAL HACKS. 
BUT YOU CAN ONLY DO IT, YOU 
NEED TO VOTE REPUBLICANS. 
I MEAN WE HAVE GOOD PEOPLE.    
I WANT TO GET ALONG WITH THEM, 
BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE IN MANY 
WAYS, JUST REALLY TOUGH. 
IT REALLY IS. 
THEY HAVE BEEN TAKING SO MUCH 
THAT POCAHONTAS IS CONSIDERED A 
CONSERVATIVE IN THE DEMOCRAT 
PARTY, LIKE A CONSERVATIVE 
PERSON.    
POCAHONTAS, ELIZABETH WARREN IS 
CONSIDERED LIKE A CONSERVATIVE 
PERSON. 
THESE PEOPLE, THEY HAVE GOTTEN 
CRAZY, LOCO.    
WE ARE JOINED TODAY BY MANY 
TERRIFIC REPUBLICAN LEADERS.  
INCLUDING A FRIEND OF MINE AND 
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, HE'S THE 
BIGGEST HUMAN BEING THAT I HAVE 
EVER SEEN.  
DO WE LIKE HIM? 
HE'S OUR GREAT GOVERNOR.    
THE HIGHEST. 
NOW LISTEN, THIS IS WEST 
VIRGINIA. 
HIGHEST EVER FIRST QUARTER 
SURPLUS HISTORY.    
$125 BILLION ABOVE ESTIMATE. 
REVENUE GROWTH BY MONTH JULY UP

THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP, 
THANK YOU.   
>> I'LL BE SHORT AND SWEET.    
NOBODY COULD LOVE THIS MAN MORE 
THAN I. EXCEPT YOU MAYBE.  
WHAT HE HAS DONE FOR WEST 
VIRGINIA IS OFF THE CHARTS. 
NOW WE NEED TO STEP UP TO THE 
PLATE. 
WE'VE GOT TO STEP UP AND 
DELIVER HIM PATRICK MORRISEY. 
WE HAVE TO DELIVER HIM AN 
ABSOLUTE SOLID REPUBLICAN 
CONGRESS. 
COME ON NOW.    
GET BEHIND HIM. 
GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU.     
>> BIG JIM.    
THAT IS -- THAT IS A BIG MAN 
AND HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB. 
HE REALLY IS. 
BUT LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS. 
FOR JULY UP 24.1% REVENUE 
GROWTH. 
THINK OF THAT. 
I'LL TELL YOU LOOK, YOU PEOPLE, 
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE GREAT TO ME. 
WE WON THIS STATE BY 42%. 
YOU FOE WHAT 42 POINTS IS? 
AND THAT'S IN ALL FAIRNESS, 
THAT'S AGAINST A DEMOCRAT. 
WE WON BY 42 POINTS. 
YOU TOOK ME IN, BUT I PRODUCED. 
I PRODUCED.   
I PRODUCED, THESE ARE GREAT 
PEOPLE AND THEY LOVE NOT ONLY 
THE BEAUTIFUL CLEAN COAL, BUT 
THEY LOVE LOTS OF OTHER THINGS 
THAT WE'RE DOING WELL. 
WEST VIRGINIA IS BACK.  
A LOT FASTER THAN EVEN I 
THOUGHT IT COULD HAPPEN. 
I GET HUGGED BACKSTAGE BY 
MINORS, GUYS WHO GRAB ME. 
I SAY HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO 
MAKE THE COMPUTER WIDGETS? 
NO, THEY HAVE NO INTEREST IN 
LITTLE COMPUTER PARTS. 
SO WE ALSO HAVE WITH US THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE MACK WARNER. 
THANKS, MACK.

SUPPORT BECAUSE HE'S BEEN 
TERRIFIC, REALLY DID A GREAT 
JOB AS A CONGRESSMAN, HE'S

BE A JUSTICE. 
EVAN JENKINS, THANK YOU. 
YOU NEED TO GO OUT AND VOTE FOR 
HIM.    
A WOMAN THAT EVERYBODY 
REPUBLICANS, SHE IS RUNNING 
AGAINST A TOTAL WACKO.  
YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT PERSON IN 
CONGRESS.

CRAZY.    
A PERSON THAT YOU KNOW VERY 
WELL, EVERYBODY IN WEST 
VIRGINIA LOVES CAROL MILLER.    
PENNSYLVANIA, THANKS.

I THINK YOU'RE IN GREAT SHAPE 
FROM WHAT I HEAR, I HOPE SO. 
GUY RASETHENALLER.    
THANK YOU, THANKS, GUY. 
WE ARE ALL SO THRILLED TO BE 
JOINED BY OHIO CONGRESSMAN, A 
FRIEND OF MINE FROM DAY ONE. 
HE SUPPORTED TRUMP WHEN IT 
WASN'T AS FASHIONABLE RIGHT AT 
THE BEGINNING. 
HE DIDN'T GO THROUGH NINE 
CANDIDATES AND THEN SAY HOW I'M 
GOING TO SUPPORT THIS GUY, BUT 
WE HAD A COUPLE OF THEM. 
THEY NEVER TELL ME THAT NOW. 
THEY TELL ME THEY SUPPORTED ME 
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. 
THIS GUY REALLY DID. 
BILL JOHNSON.

HERE TO SUPPORT. 
THE NEXT SENATOR FROM THE GREAT 
STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA. 
SOMEBODY THAT'S GOING TO GIVE 
US A VOTE FOR WHAT WE WANT 
EVERY SINGLE TIME. 
THERE WON'T BE ANY QUESTION 
ABOUT IT, PATRICK MORRISEY. 
PATRICK, PLEASE COME UP. 
PATRICK. 
    
>> WELL THANK YOU PRESIDENT 
DONALD TRUMP, THANK YOU 
GOVERNOR JUSTICE. 
THANKS TO THIS AMAZING CROWD 
FOR THIS VERY WARM WELCOME. 
    NOW I'LL TELL 
YOU, THIS GUY REALLY IS MAKING 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND WE 
KNOW HE'S ALSO MAKING WEST 
VIRGINIA GREAT AGAIN. 
NOW FOR FAR TOO LONG, BARACK 
OBAMA --     
HILLARY CLINTON. 
    
AND WASHINGTON LIBERAL JOE 
MANCHIN. 
    
ALL OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AND 
THE COASTAL ELITES, THEY 
ABANDONED OUR WEST VIRGINIA 
VALUES. 
THEY PRACTICED POLITICAL 
CORRECTNESS. 
THEY ADVANCED LIBERAL POLICIES. 
THEY DIDN'T PUT AMERICA FIRST. 
NO. 
BUT FORTUNATELY FOR ALL OF US 
THERE WAS ONE CANDIDATE, ONE 
MAN WILLING TO FIGHT BACK 
AGAINST POLITICAL CORRECTNESS 
AND PUT AMERICA FIRST. 
DONALD J. TRUMP! 
    
THIS ELECTION WEST VIRGINIA HAS 
A VERY BIG DECISION TO MAKE. 
YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE VALUES 
OF THOSE WHO ABANDONED WEST 
VIRGINIA, HILLARY CLINTON, 
BARACK OBAMA, OR JOE MANCHIN.   
   
OR YOU CAN STAND WITH SOMEONE 
WHO PUTS YOU FIRST, AMERICA 
FIRST, AND WEST VIRGINIA FIRST. 
    
THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION 
COULDN'T BE HIGHER. 
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MYSELF 
AND MY OPPONENT, DISHONEST 
WASHINGTON LIBERAL JOE MANCHIN, 
THEY COULDN'T BE SHARPER. 
GUYS, YOU HAVE A CHOICE. 
IF YOU VOTE FOR PATRICK 
MORRISEY, YOU'LL BE ELECTING A 
CONSERVATIVE FIGHTER WITH A 
RECORD RESULT WHO WILL ADVANCE 
THE TRUMP JOBS AGENDA! 
    
A VOTE FOR DISHONEST WASHINGTON 
LIBERAL JOE MANCHIN -- [ BOOING 
]  
>> HANG ON. 
YOU'RE GOING TO BE EMPOWERING 
THAT SAME GROUP OF RADICAL 
LIBERAL OBSTRUCTIONIST, THE ONE 
YOU SAW IN THE SENATE CIRCUS 
THIS PAST WEEK. 
NOW DISHONEST WASHINGTON 
LIBERAL, JOE MANCHIN, JOE'S GOT 
TO GO, AMEN, BROTHER.    
NOW DISHONEST WASHINGTON 
LIBERAL JOE MANCHIN HAS A 
HISTORY OF ABANDONING WEST 
VIRGINIA. 
HE ABANDONED YOUR GUN RIGHTS 
SUPPORTING OBAMA'S RADICAL GUN 
CONTROL.  
  
HE ABANDONED YOUR VALUES ON 
LIFE BACK ON PLANNED 
PARENTHOOD.  
  
HE ABANDONED YOUR PAYCHECKS 
WHEN HE SAID NO TO THE TRUMP 
TAX CUTS.  
  
HE ABANDONS YOU WHEN HE 
SUPPORTS AMNESTY AND WHEN HE 
OPPOSED TRUMP'S BORDER WALL. 
    BUT WE'RE GOING 
TO BUILD THAT WALL. 
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD THAT WALL. 
BUT IT GETS WORSE. 
JOE MANCHIN SUPPORTED HILLARY 
CLINTON EVEN AFTER, HANG ON, 
EVEN AFTER SHE MADE CLEAR SHE 
WANTED TO TAKE AWAY OUR COAL, 
OUR OIL, AND OUR GAS JOBS. 
SHAME ON JOE MANCHIN.  
   
AND THAT'S WHY LIBERAL JOE'S 
GOT TO GO.    
NOW WHEN I'M IN THE SENATE, 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A DIFFERENT 
APPROACH. 
WE'RE GOING TO PUT WEST 
VIRGINIA FIRST.    
WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT AGAINST 
ALL THOSE UNLAWFUL AND ILLEGAL 
REGULATIONS THAT HOLD BACK JOB 
CREATORS LIKE THE ONE I 
DEFEATED AS YOUR ATTORNEY 
GENERAL AND THE ONES THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS WITHDRAWING. 
WE'RE GOING TO IGNITE THE 
ECONOMY EVEN MORE. 
WE'LL SUPER CHARGE WEST 
VIRGINIA WHEN WE MAKE THE TRUMP 
TAX CUTS PERMANENT. 
    
AND WE'RE GOING TO REEMPOWER 
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF WEST 
VIRGINIA WITH TERM LIMITS TO 
HOLD WASHINGTON POLITICIANS 
ACCOUNTABLE.    
WE'LL STOP THE FUNDING OF 
PLANNED PARENTHOOD, YEAH, WE 
WILL. 
AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE BACK 
OUR WEST VIRGINIA VALUES AND 
END THE GRABS BY THE LIBERALS 
IN WASHINGTON. 
AND NOT INSIGNIFICANTLY. 
WE'LL ALL STAND FOR THE 
NATIONAL ANTHEM.     
    
>> THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.  
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP. 
WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF SUPPORT 
FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
IN FACT BECAUSE OF HIS LAST 
TRIP, WE'RE BASICALLY EVEN IN 
THE POLLS.    
BUT WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO 
DO AGAINST THE WILEY WAYS OF 
THE WASHINGTON'S POLITICIANS. 
I NEED YOU TO GET INVOLVED. 
I NEED YOU TO VOLUNTEER. 
I NEED YOU TO GO ONLINE AT 
PATRICKMORRISEY.COM, AND 
DONATE, AND HELP ME CLOSE THE 
GAP AGAINST THE LIBERAL ATM 
MACHINE OF CHUCK SCHUMER AND 
JOE MANCHIN.  
THIS RACE WILL LIKELY DECIDE 
THE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE 
SENATE.    
AMEN, BROTHER.    
BUT REMEMBER, THOSE RADICALS IN 
WASHINGTON, SCHUMER, PELOSI, 
MAX SEEN WATER -- MAXINE WATERS 
AND JOE MANCHIN, YES. 
THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE OUR 
PRESIDENT SUCCEED. 
THEY WANT TO OBSTRUCT JUST LIKE 
THEY DID THIS WEEK AGAINST 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE MUST 
CONFIRM JUDGE KAVANAUGH!    
IT'S TIME TO JOIN OUR TEAM 
TODAY BECAUSE JOE'S GOT TOGO. 
HE'S GOT TO GO. 
IS IT'S MY HONOR TO STAND WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO FIGHT FOR 
YOU. 
WE, UNLIKE JOE MANCHIN, HILLARY 
CLINTON AND THE RADICAL 
LIBERALS WILL NEVER ABANDON OUR 
AMERICAN AND OUR WEST VIRGINIA 
VALUES. 
THE ONE THING YOU'LL KNOW IS 
THAT TOGETHER THIS TEAM, WE'RE 
GOING TO CONTINUE MAKING 
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND WE 
WILL MAKE WEST VIRGINIA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
GOD BLESS YOU!    
>> THANK YOU, WOW. 
GOOD JOB, PATRICK.    
THANK YOU, PATRICK. 
REMEMBER THIS. 
A VOTE FOR PATRICK MORRISEY IS 
A VOTE TO STAND UP FOR WEST 
VIRGINIA VALUES, RIGHT?    
A VOTE FOR MORRISEY IS A VOTE 
FOR BE ME AND FOR OUR AGENDA TO 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN OR AS 
WE WILL SOON START SAYING, KEEP 
AMERICA GREAT, RIGHT? 
KEEP AMERICA GREAT.    
KEEP AMERICA GREAT. 
THAT'LL BE OUR NEW THEME VERY 
SOON, I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T 
WANT TO SWITCH YET. 
A LITTLE TOO SOON. 
WE'RE NOT EVEN INTO TWO YEARS, 
RIGHT? 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 
I CAN'T USE IT IN 2020.    
WE CAN'T BECAUSE BY THAT TIME 
IF WE GO EVEN LIKE HALF OF WHAT 
WE'VE DONE, SO WE'RE GOING TO 
HAVE THE NEW ONE. 
IT'LL BE KEEP AMERICA GREAT.    
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT 
ELECTION. 
IT WILL DECIDE WHICH PARTY 
CONTROLS THE UNITED STATES 
SENATE. 
A DEMOCRAT CONTROLLED SENATE 
WILL TRY TO TAKE AWAY YOUR 
SECOND AMENDMENT. 
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE IT AWAY.  
THEY WANT TO TAKE OVER AMERICAN 
HEALTH CARE AND DESTROY IT.    
THEY WANT TO MAKE US VENEZUELA, 
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. 
YOU'LL HAVE VENEZUELA'S BIG 
VERSION, ERASE AMERICA'S 
BORDERS. 
YOU KNOW WE FIGHT FOR BORDERS. 
HEY BY THE WAY I SEE THE SIGNS, 
FINISH THE WALL. 
WE ARE I THE PROCESS.    
JUST GOT ANOTHER BILLION, I 
WANT TO GET MORE, BUT IT'S 
COMING, IT'S COMING. 
WE BUILT A LOT OF THE WALL 
ALREADY AND FIXED A LOT OF 
WALL, BUT WE'RE GETTING IT.  
IT'S NOT THE EASIEST THING 
BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS KNOW IT'S 
THE THING WE REALLY WANT. 
IT'S VERY MUCH OF A SIGNATURE, 
A VERY BIG PART OF WHAT WE 
TALKED ABOUT. 
THEY GET IN THE WAY. 
I KNOW IT FOR A FACT. 
THEY SAID WE CAN'T -- WE'LL GET 
THINGS IS THAT ARE ACTUALLY 
MILITARY, $700 BILLION AND $716 
BILLION. 
WE GET THAT, A WALL IS A TINY 
THING BY COMPARISON, BUT THEY 
WANT TO FIGHT THAT WALL FOR 
POLITICAL PURPOSES. 
BUT WE'RE BUILDING IT AND I 
LOVE THE SIGNS, FINISH IT. 
WE'LL GET IT FINISHED.  
THEY WANT TO KILL AND THIS WILL 
HAPPEN AS SURE AS YOU'RE 
STANDING OR SITTING. 
I DON'T KNOW WHO IS A BETTER 
SEAT. 
YOU OR YOU?    
THIS IS A GUARANTEE. 
YOUR COAL MINES AND YOUR MINERS 
ARE WORKING. 
THEY WILL KILL WEST VIRGINIA 
COAL. 
THAT'S A GUARANTEE.    
AND THEY WANT TO TURN OFF 
FEDERAL COURTS INTO THE 
POLITICAL ARM OF THE DEMOCRAT 
RESISTANCE. 
YOU SEE IT. 
YOU SEE IT.    
NOW JOE MANCHIN VOTED NO ON TAX 
CUTS FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES. 
HE JUST VOTED NO. 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY? 
HE VOTED NO ON REMOVING OBAMA'S 
JOB KILLING REGULATIONS. 
BIT WAY WE'VE CUT MORE 
REGULATIONS. 
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE ALL THESE 
JOBS, RECORD SETTING JOBS. 
MORE REGULATIONS THAN ANY 
PRESIDENT EVER IN THE HISTORY 
OF OUR COUNTRY. 
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.    
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD. 
AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN THERE FOR 
TWO YEARS, BUT TIME IS FLYING, 
ISN'T IT? 
TIME IS FLYING. 
WE'VE CUT MORE THAN ANY 
ADMINISTRATION, WHETHER IT WAS 
FOUR YEARS, EIGHT YEARS, OR IN 
ONE CASE MUCH MORE THAN THAT. 
WE'VE CUT MORE. 
JOE ALSO VOTED TO ON REPEALING 
AND REPLACING OBAMACARE, WHICH 
WE ALMOST HAD DONE, BUT I'LL BE 
NICE NOW. 
IF WE DID, WE WOULD HAVE KILLED 
IT, BUT WE'RE GIVING YOU A LOT 
OF GREAT HEALTH CARE ANYWAY. 
IF YOU LOOKING AT THE PLANS, 
AND IT WILL BE THE WORSE PART 
OF OBAMA.    
THE BORDER DAMS, PELOSI 
>>> THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WILL 
STOP AT NOTHING BUT RUN YOUR 
LIVES, RUN DOWN YOUR VALUES, 
AND RANSACK OUR NATION'S 
WEALTH. 
WE HAVE NEVER DONE LIKE THIS. 
THEY WILL TURN IT AROUND, MAKE 
IT BAD SO FAST. 
GETTING MONEY FOR THE MILITARY. 
WE'RE SO TOUGH. 
AND TO DO THAT, WE HAD TO GIVE 
THEM MONEY FOR THINGS THEY 
DON'T WANT. 
WE WOULD NEVER WANT. 
NOW WE HAVE OUR MILITARY 
REBUILDING. 
WE HAVE TAKEN CARE OF OUR 
MILITARY. 
WE ORDERED MASSIVE NUMBERS OF 
FIGHTER JETS AND PLANES. 
SHIPS, ROCKETS, AND MISSILES. 
WE MAKE THE GREATEST MILITARY 
EQUIPMENT IN THE WORLD. 
WE HAVE ORDERED SO MUCH THAT 
OTHER COUNTRIES LOOK AT US AND 
THEY SAY, LET'S FORGET ABOUT 
THEM. 
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. 
WE DON'T WANT WARS. 
BUT THE ONLY WAY YOU DON'T HAVE 
WARS IS IF YOU HAVE A MILITARY 
THAT IS WHAT WE'RE DOING. 
WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF 
BUILDING THE STRONGEST MILITARY 
WE'VE EVER HAD BY FAR. 
THE NEW PLATFORM OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 
YOU NOTICE I SAY DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY. 
I HATE THE WAY IT SAYS. 
IT FLOWS NICER. 
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 
BUT YOU KNOW, THE REAL NAME IS 
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY. 
I HATE THE WAY IT SOUNDS AND 
THAT'S WHY I USE IT. 
IT'S THE REAL NAME. 
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY, SO WHEN YOU 
SEE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, IT'S 
WRONG. 
THERE'S NO NAME DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY. 
THAT'S A GREAT NAME. 
THEY SHOULD PROBABLY CHANGE THE 
NAME, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. 
CALL THEM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS RADICAL 
SOCIALISM, VENEZUELA, AND OPEN 
BORDERS. 
IT'S NOW CALLED, TO ME, YOU'VE 
NEVER HEARD THIS BEFORE. 
THE PARTY OF CRIME. 
IT'S A PARTY OF CRIME. 
IT'S WHAT IT IS. 
AND TO PAY FOR THEIR SOCIALISM, 
WHICH IS GOING TO DESTROY OUR 
COUNTRY, DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAID 
MEDICARE AND DESTROY SOCIAL 
SECURITY. 
THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN. 
DEMOCRATS WANT TO COMPLETELY 
DESTROY MEDICARE WITH SO-CALLED 
MEDICARE FOR ALL. 
YEAH, FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS 
BEFORE THE COUNTRY GOES OUT OF 
BUSINESS. 
ROBBING OUR SENIORS OF THE 
BENEFITS THEY PAID INTO FOR 
THEIR ENTIRE LIVES. 
GIVING IT TO PEOPLE THAT DON'T 
DESERVE IT. 
GIVING IT, BY THE WAY, TO 
ILLEGAL ALIENS WHO COME INTO 
OUR COUNTRY. 
OKAY. REPUBLICANS WANT TO 
PROTECT MEDICARE FOR OUR GREAT 
SENIORS WHO HAVE EARNED IT AND 
PAID FOR IT. 
AND I WILL ALWAYS FIGHT FOR AND 
ALWAYS PROTECT PATIENTS WITH 
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS. 
YOU HAVE TO DO IT. 
YOU HAVE TO DO IT. 
SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT'S NOT A 
REPUBLICAN THING TO DO. 
I DON'T CARE. 
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, ALL OF 
THE REPUBLICANS ARE COMING INTO 
THAT POSITION NOW. 
ALL OF THEM. 
AND WE'LL DO IT THE RIGHT WAY, 
TOO. 
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS ARE 
SAFE. 
OKAY. 
JUST REMEMBER THAT. 
PREEXISTING, TELL THAT TO THE 
FAKE NEWS MEDIA WHEN THEY 
WRITE. 
THE FAKERS. 
BUT WE ALL HAVE A GOOD TIME. 
THEY WILL ALL ENDORSE ME FOR 
THE NEXT ELECTION. 
HAVE YOU HEARD? 
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'T, AND SOME 
REASON I DIDN'T WIN, EVERY 
SINGLE MEDIA OUTLET GOES 
BANKRUPT. 
CAN YOU IMAGINE? 
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THEY HAD TO 
COVER CRAZY BERNIE? 
WHO WILL WATCH? 
OR ANY OF THEM. 
HOW ABOUT CORY BOOKER. 
DID YOU WATCH THE PERFORMANCE? 
HE RAN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY, INTO 
THE GROUND AND NOW HE WANTS TO 
BE PRESIDENT, RIGHT? 
WHAT WAS THE MOMENT HE SAID HE 
HAD? 
I DON'T THINK SO. 
I THINK WE TAKE KIRK DOUGLAS IN 
HIS PRIME. 
I THINK WE DID. 
NO, HE RAN NEWARK INTO THE 
GROUND. 
NOW HE'S ACTING HE'S SO 
WONDERFUL, GREAT, I DREAM OF 
THESE PEOPLE EVERY NIGHT. 
THE ONLY THING I WORRY ABOUT IS 
THAT SOME TOTAL UNKNOWN THAT NO 
ONE HEARD OF COMES ALONG. 
HONESTLY, WITH WHAT WE'VE DONE 
ON JOBS, ON OUR COUNTRY, ON OUR 
MILITARY, WE'RE GOING TO TALK 
ABOUT OUR VETERANS AND WHAT 
WE'VE DONE. 
IN YOUR CASE, ENERGY. 
ENERGY, LOOK WHAT WE'VE DONE ON 
ENERGY. 
WHO THE CAN BEAT US? 
WHO CAN BEAT US? 
WHO CAN BEAT US? 
ONE OF THESE PEOPLE SAID 
RECENTLY AND THEY HATED TO SAY 
IT. 
TRUMP HAS ACTUALLY FULFILLED 
MORE PROMISES THAN HE PROMISED. 
IT'S TRUE. 
LOOK WHAT WE'RE DOING. 
4.2% GDP. 
EVERY POINT IS $3.5 TRILLION 
AND 10 MILLION JOBS. 
WHEN I TOOK IT OVER, OUR 
COUNTRY WAS HEADED SOUTH. 
WE WERE GOING DOWN. 
WE WERE GOING DOWN. 
INSTEAD OF 4.2, YOU WOULD BE 
NEGATIVE 4.2. 
THAT'S THE WAY WE WERE HEADED. 
PERHAPS NOTHING IS MORE 
DANGEROUS THAN THE DEMOCRATS 
PUSH TO ABOLISH VERY BRAVE 
PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR US AND 
THAT LOVE US AND TAKE CARE OF 
US CALLED ICE. 
THEY WANT TO ABOLISH 
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT 
ENTIRELY. 
AND THEY WANT NO BORDERS. 
LET EVERYBODY JUST POUR INTO 
OUR COUNTRY. 
YOU HAVE SOME BAD DUDES COMING 
IN, BUT THEY ARE NOT COMING IN 
WITH US. 
WE SET RECORDS AT ARRESTS AT 
THE BORDERS. 
NOBODY EVEN CLOSE. 
AND THAT'S WITHOUT THE WALL IN 
THOSE SECTIONS WHERE WE HAVEN'T 
BEEN ABLE TO GET THE MONEY 
BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS WON'T 
APPROVE. 
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, WE HAVE 
VERY SMALL MARGINS. 
THEY SAY WE ARE THE MAJORITY? 
IF SMALL HAS A COLD, WE CAN'T 
TAKE A VOTE. 
IF SOMEBODY IS NOT FEELING 
WELL, WE SAY LET'S DELAY THE 
VOTE FOR THREE DAYS. 
WE DON'T HAVE A MAJORITY. 
IT'S SO CLOSE. 
IT'S SO CLOSE. 
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO GET MORE 
REPUBLICANS IN. 
WE WILL DO SOMETHING THAT 
NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE. 
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY SUPPORTS 
TOTALLY, THEY LOVE THEM, 
SANCTUARY CITIES, WHERE CRIME 
POURS IN AND THEY ARE 
PROTECTED. 
THAT UNLEASH VIOLENT PREDATORS 
LIKE MS13 INTO AMERICAN 
COMMUNITIES. 
LEAVING INNOCENT AMERICANS AT 
THE MERCY OF REALLY, BY THE 
WAY, REALLY RUTHLESS ANIMALS. 
REALLY RUTHLESS ANIMALS. 
NANCY PELOSI SAID, HOW DARE HE 
CALL A HUMAN BEING AN ANIMAL? 
I'M SORRY, NANCY. 
THEY DON'T LIKE GUNS, THEY LIKE 
TO USE KNIVES BECAUSE IT'S MORE 
PAINFUL AND IT TAKES A LONG 
TIME. 
THESE ARE REAL BAD PEOPLE. 
WE'RE BRINGING THEM OUT SO 
FAST. 
YOU KNOW WHO IS LEADING THE 
CHARGE? 
WHO LOVES DOING IT? 
ICE. 
WHO THE WANTS THAT JOB? 
ICE IS DOING THE JOB. 
RIGHT? 
RIGHT. ICE IS DOING THAT JOB. 
THESE ARE BRAVE PEOPLE. 
THEY GO INTO TOWNS IN LONG 
ISLAND WHERE I GREW UP. 
RIGHT NEXT TO THESE PLACES. 
I KNOW THEM ALL. 
IT USED TO BE, YOU LEAVE YOUR 
WINDOW OPEN, YOU LEAVE YOUR 
DOOR OPEN. 
YOU GO TO SLEEP. 
NOT ANYMORE. 
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THEY GO IN 
LIKE THEY ARE LIBERATING A 
COUNTRY. 
IT'S LIKE THIS IS THE UNITED 
STATES. 
AND ICE GOES IN AND MS13, THEY 
ARE AFRAID OF ICE. 
ICE IS MUCH TOUGHER THAN THEY 
ARE. 
THAT'S ALL THEY FEAR. 
AND THEY GO IN AND THEY GRAB 
THEM BY THEIR NECKS AND THROW 
THEM INTO A PADDY WAGON AND 
TAKE THEM TO JAIL OR THROW THEM 
OUT OF THE COUNTRY. 
IT'S VERY SIMPLE. 
AND THEY CLEAN OUT TOWNS. 
THEY CLEAN OUT TOWNS OF TRULY 
BAD PEOPLE. 
DANGEROUS PEOPLE. 
YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED. 
I GOT TO KNOW MOTHERS THAT HAVE 
DAUGHTERS, FATHERS THAT HAVE 
DAUGHTERS. 
IN MANY CASES DAUGHTERS AND IN 
MANY CASES SONS. 
BUT WHAT THEY DO TO THESE 
INCREDIBLE KIDS WALKING HOME 
FROM SCHOOL. 
GOING HOME WITH BOOKS TO STUDY, 
DO HOMEWORK AND THEY INTERCEPT 
THEM AND THEY ARE HORRIBLE. 
IT'S HORRIBLE. 
WE ARE GET TING THEM OUT. 
THE DEMOCRATS, IT'S LIKE THEY 
DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THAT 
THERE'S A PROBLEM. 
IT'S INCREDIBLE. 
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE AMERICA 
SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR LAW-
ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT CRIMINAL 
ALIENS. 
SO, REPUBLICANS, NOT DEMOCRATS, 
THEY WANT TO END ICE. 
THEY WANT TO END A LOT OF 
THINGS. 
OPEN BORDERS. 
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? 
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE THIS 
PLATFORM? 
WE WANT OPEN BORDERS, HIGH 
TAXES, WE WANT CRIME. 
BECAUSE BASICALLY, THEY ARE 
SAYING CRIME. 
SO THEY HAVE CRIME, HIGH TAXES, 
OPEN BORDERS, AND BY THE WAY, 
WE DON'T WANT TO FUND THE 
MILITARY. 
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HARD IT IS 
TO GET MONEY FOR THE MILITARY. 
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. 
THAT WAS LIKE A FULL TIME JOB. 
BUT WE GOT THAT MONEY. 
WE GOT A LOT OF MONEY. 
IF THE DEMOCRATS GOT 51 VOTES 
IN THE SENATE, THEY WOULD OPEN 
OUR NATION'S BORDERS. 
THEY WOULD STARVE OUR LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
THEY WOULD STARVE -- DO WE LOVE 
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT? 
SERIOUSLY. 
I GOT A TREMENDOUS PERCENTAGE 
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT VOTE, BUT I 
THINK I MIGHT HAVE -- DID I GET 
100%? 
WHO WOULDN'T VOTE FOR ME FROM 
LAW ENFORCEMENT? 
WE'VE DONE A LOT. 
WE HAVE GOTTEN THEM A LOT OF 
MATERIAL FROM THE MILITARY. 
WE HAD HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS OF SURPLUS MATERIAL. 
AND OUR PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION 
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES DID THEY 
WANT TO GIVE THIS TO LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, IT'S GREAT 
EQUIPMENT. 
IT KEEPS THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
SAFE, LIKE TRUCKS THAT ARE 
ARMORED AND THINGS LIKE THAT. 
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE IT. 
THEY THOUGHT IT PRESENTED A 
WRONG IMAGE. 
I GAVE IT. 
IT'S ALL OUT. 
THEY ARE ALL HAPPY. 
WE HAD IT. 
IT'S MILITARY. 
WE HAD IT SITTING IN STORAGE 
ROOMS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 
GETTING OLD AND PROBABLY 
COSTING US A LOT OF MONEY. 
WE GAVE IT OUT TO LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES LIKE 
US. 
IF YOU WANT TO SECURE OUR 
BORDER. 
IF YOU WANT TO STOP SANCTUARY 
CITIES, WHICH EVEN IN 
CALIFORNIA NOW, THEY DON'T WANT 
TO BE SANCTUARY CITIES ANYMORE. 
THEY WANT OUT. 
YOU SEE IT. 
THEY ARE REBELLING IN 
CALIFORNIA OF ALL PLACES. 
THEY ARE REBELLING. 
IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT AMERICAN 
COMMUNITIES FROM REALLY BAD, 
BAD CRIME, THEN YOU NEED TO 
VOTE REPUBLICAN. 
PATRICK MORRISEY, HAVE TO VOTE 
REPUBLICAN. 
THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT SECURITY 
AND IT'S ABOUT PROSPERITY. 
HERE ARE SOME OF OUR 
EXTRAORDINARY ACHIEVEMENTS. 
WE HAVE DONE THINGS THAT NOBODY 
CAN BELIEVE. 
IF I WOULD HAVE USED THESE 
NUMBERS DURING THE CAMPAIGN, 
THE FAKE NEWS WOULD HAVE SAID 
OH, IT'S SO RIDICULOUS. 
IT'S SO RIDICULOUS. 
HOW CAN HE SAY THAT? 
I USE MUCH LOWER NUMBERS THAN 
THEY SAID. 
ECONOMIC GROWTH LAST QUARTER 
WAS 4.1 AND IT WAS JUST 
ADJUSTED UPWARD, 4.2%. 
IT'S GOING A LOT HIGHER, FOLKS. 
IT'S GOING A LOT HIGHER. 
JOBLESS CLAIMS, THAT'S A 
BEAUTY. 
JOBLESS. 
THINK OF THAT. 
JOBLESS CLAIMS JUST FELL TO A 
NEARLY 50 YEAR LOW. 
IS THAT GOOD? 
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT? 
50 YEAR LOW. 
WE HAVE CREATED OVER 4 MILLION 
NEW JOBS SINCE THE ELECTION. 
4MILLION. 
NOBODY WOULD HAVE SAID THAT. 
IF I WOULD HAVE SAID, WE'LL 
CREATE IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS, 
THEY WOULD SAY, YOU HAVE TO BE 
KIDDING. 
LOOK AT THIS. 
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE. 
WE LIFTED ALMOST 4 MILLION 
AMERICANS OFF OF FOOD STAMPS. 
WOW. 
PRETTY GOOD. 
NOW NUMBER ONE, WE'RE TAKING 
CARE OF PEOPLE. 
NUMBER TWO, IT DOESN'T COST US 
ANYTHING. 
4MILLION PEOPLE, THAT'S A LOT 
OF MONEY. 
WE ADDED NEARLY, IT WILL SOON 
BE 600,000 NEW MANUFACTURING 
JOBS. 
WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE 
ADDING JOBS. 
WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE 
ADDING MANUFACTURING JOBS. 
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THE MOST 
INCREDIBLE OF EVERYTHING, IS WE 
ARE DOING THINGS WITH 
MANUFACTURING. 
COMPANIES ARE POURING BACK INTO 
OUR COUNTRY AND THEY ARE COMING 
BACK INTO YOUR STATE. 
THEY ARE GOING TO MICHIGAN. 
THEY ARE GOING TO OHIO RIGHT 
HERE. 
THEY ARE GOING TO PENNSYLVANIA 
AND NORTH CAROLINA AND SOUTH 
CAROLINA. 
I WAS WITH PRIME MINISTER, ABI, 
OF JAPAN. 
HE HAS MANY COMPANIES MOVING 
IN. 
I SAID LOOK, WE HAVE A BIG 
DEFICIT WITH YOU. 
WE TAKE CARE OF YOUR MILITARY 
AND WE HAVE A DEFICIT. 
THEY SAID WE ARE MOVING MANY 
COMPANIES INTO THE UNITED 
STATES. 
AND HE IS, AND HE HAS BEEN. 
AND IF YOU LOOK, JUST TAKE A 
LOOK. 
MANY COUNTRIES ARE DOING THAT. 
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE HAVING 
DEFICITS WITH EVERY COUNTRY. 
AND CHINA, WE'RE TAKING THEM ON 
VERY STRONGLY. 
FIRST TIME EVER. 
VERY STRONGLY. 
AND THEY EITHER OPEN IT UP TO 
MAKE IT FAIR AND DON'T CHARGE 
US WHAT THEY'RE DOING BECAUSE 
THAT'S NO GOOD OR WE JUST DON'T 
DO BUSINESS WITH THEM. 
IT'S A SIMPLE THING. 
AND IN FOUR MONTHS, THEY HAVE 
GONE WAY DOWN. 
I DON'T WANT THEM TO GO WAY 
DOWN. 
I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR CHINA. 
THEY HAVE NOT TREATED US WELL. 
WE LOST OVER THE YEARS, $500 
BILLION. 
400, 500. 
$523BILLION. 
WE REBUILT CHINA. 
HOW STUPID ARE WE? 
HOW STUPID ARE WE? 
WE BUILD A CAR AND WE SEND IT 
TO CHINA AND THEY CHARGE A 
TARIFF OR A TAX OF 25%. 
THEY BUILD A CAR AND THEY SEND 
IT TO THE U.S. AND IT IS 2.5%, 
BUT WE DON'T CHARGE THEM. 
THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY. 
AND I SAID WHY DON'T THEY HAVE 
TO PAY AT LEAST THE 2.5? 
NOBODY COULD TELL ME WHY. 
NOBODY. 
SO THINK OF IT. 
THEY CHARGE US 25%, RIGHT? 
WE CHARGE THEM NOTHING. 
OTHER THAN THAT, IT'S A VERY 
FAIR DEAL. 
HOW STUPID IS IT? 
SO THE STUPID DAYS ARE OVER, 
FOLKS. 
I'M SORRY. 
I LOVE SAUDI ARABIA. 
THEY ARE GREAT. 
KING SOLEMN. 
I SPOKE TO HIM THIS MORNING. 
I SAID TO HIM, KING, YOU HAVE 
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. 
WITHOUT US, WHO KNOWS WHAT IS 
GOING TO HAPPEN. 
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE 
ABLE TO KEEP THOSE AIRPLANES, 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? 
THEY WOULD BE ATTACKED. 
WITH US, THEY ARE SAFE. 
TOTALLY SAFE. 
úBUT WE DON'T GET 
BE GETTING. 
WE ARE SUBSIDIZING THEIR 
MILITARY. 
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION, WHY 
ARE WE SUBSIDIZING THE MILITARY 
OF THESE REALLY WEALTHY 
COUNTRIES? 
IT'S ONE THING WHERE COUNTRIES 
ARE IN DEEP TROUBLE AND DANGER 
AND IT COULD BE SOMETHING 
REALLY UGLY AND HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 
COULD BE KILLED. 
THAT'S ONE THING. 
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE WEALTHY 
COUNTRIES LIKE SAUDI ARABIA, 
LIKE JAPAN, LIKE SOUTH KOREA, 
WHY ARE WE SUBSIDIZING THEIR 
MILITARY? 
THEY WILL PAY US. 
THE PROBLEM IS, NOBODY EVER 
ASKED. 
NOBODY EVER ASKED. 
THEY DON'T ASK.
I MEAN, WITH SOUTH KOREA, WE 
ARE PAYING ABOUT 60% OF THEIR 
MILITARY COSTS. 
THEY BUY A MISSILE SYSTEM, BY 
THE WAY, WE'RE DOING GREAT WITH 
NORTH KOREA. 
I HAVE TO TELL YOU. 
WE'RE DOING GREAT. 
YOU KNOW, THESE DISHONEST 
PEOPLE BACK THERE. 
WHAT DID I DO? 
WAS I THERE THREE MONTHS AGO? 
FOR 80 YEARS, THEY HAVE BEEN 
WORKING WITH THIS. 
FOR 25 YEARS, THEY HAVE BEEN 
WORKING ON MISSILES AND 
NUCLEAR. 
THEY GOT NOWHERE. 
THEY WOULDN'T ANSWER OUR 
PRESIDENT'S PHONE CALLS. 
WHEN THEY CALLED, THEY TOLD HIM 
DON'T CALL US. 
AND YES, I AGREED, THE RHETORIC 
WAS UNBELIEVABLY HARSH AT THE 
BEGINNING. 
BUT WE HAVE A VERY GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP. 
WE WERE GOING TO WAR WITH NORTH 
KOREA. 
THAT WAS WHAT WAS GOING TO 
HAPPEN. 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN KILLED. 
PRESIDENT OBAMA TOLD ME WHEN I 
SAT JUST BEFORE TAKING OFFICE. 
HE SAID THE SINGLE BIGGEST 
PROBLEM THIS COUNTRY HAS IN 
NORTH KOREA. 
HE SAID HE WAS VERY CLOSE TO 
GOING TO WAR. 
BUT FORTUNATELY, HIS TIME WAS 
UP. 
HIS TIME WAS UP. 
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A WAR. 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN KILLED. 
I MEAN, 30 MILLION PEOPLE RIGHT 
OFF THE BORDER. 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN KILLED. 
YES, I CAME IN AND TOOK A VERY 
HARD POSITION. 
VERY HARD POSITION. 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? 
NOW WE HAVE THIS GREAT 
RELATIONSHIP AND LET'S SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS. 
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
IF YOU THINK -- SO THE FAKERS 
ARE SAYING THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT 
TO DO. 
I HAVE THE HOSTAGES BACK FOR 
NOTHING. 
OBAMA PAID $1.8 BILLION. 
I GOT THEM BACK FOR NOTHING. 
RIGHT? 
WE GOT THE REMAINS OF OUR GREAT 
HEROS BACK FOR MANY, MANY 
YEARS. 
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYMORE NUCLEAR 
TESTING. 
IN FACT, THEY ARE CLOSING UP A 
LOT OF THE SITES. 
YOU DON'T HAVE ROCKETS GOING 
UP. 
YOU DON'T HAVE MISSILES GOING 
UP. 
AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE. 
I LIKE HIM. 
HE LIKES ME. 
I GUESS THAT'S OKAY. 
AM I ALLOWED TO SAY THAT? 
AM I ALLOWED TO SAY THAT? 
WE'VE COME A LONG WAY SINCE EWE 
KNOW THE TERM, RIGHT? 
WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY. 
BUT WE COULD HAVE BEEN IN 
SOMETHING. 
I'M NOT SAYING WHAT'S GOING TO 
HAPPEN. 
WHO KNOWS, WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER 
MEETING, KIM WOULD HAVE ANOTHER 
MEETING, WE'LL HAVE A MEETING. 
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID? 
I HAD ONE OF THE ANCHORS SAY, 
WHY HAS PRESIDENT TRUMP GIVEN 
UP SO MUCH? 
I DIDN'T GIVE UP ANYTHING. 
REALLY. 
I DIDN'T GIVE UP ANYTHING. 
WHAT DID I GIVE UP? 
I GAVE UP NOTHING. 
WHY HAVE I GIVEN UP? 
THE ONLY THING I GAVE UP, I 
AGREED TO MEET. 
BOY, WE LOST A LOT, RIGHT? 
IN OTHER WORDS, I AGREED TO 
MEET. 
I GAVE UP NOTHING. 
THEY ARE JUST FAKERS. 
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. 
IT'S DRIVING THEM CRAZY. 
IT'S DRIVING THEM CRAZY. 
WE GAVE UP SO MUCH. 
NOW OBAMA WITH THE IRAN DEAL 
GAVE HIM $150 BILLION AND GAVE 
$1.8 BILLION IN CASH. 
IN CASH. 
IN CASH. 
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY THAT 
IS? 
AND NOBODY SAID HE GAVE UP TOO 
MUCH. 
EXCEPT ME. 
THAT'S WHY I ENDED THE DEAL. 
OKAY. 
I ENDED THE DEAL. 
GAVE IT TO THEM IN CASH. 
DO YOU EVER SEE WITH PROMOTION, 
WHERE YOU HAVE $100 BILLS. 
YOU HAVE A MILLION DOLLARS. 
IT'S LIKE TWICE THE SIZE OF 
THIS. 
THAT'S LIKE A MILLION BUCKS IN 
$100 BILLS. 
EXACTLY TWICE THE SIZE, CAN YOU 
IMAGINE $1.8 BILLION. 
WHERE THE DO YOU GET $1.8 
BILLION IN CASH. 
DON'T SAY IT WAS FOR THE 
HOSTAGES, OR MAYBE HE HAD 
SOMETHING ELSE IN MIND. 
WE ARE DOING GREAT. 
THAT WAS A BIG, BIG PROBLEM. 
AND YOU KNOW THE INTERESTING, 
WHEN I DID IT AND I WAS BEING 
TOUGH, AND SO DID HE. 
WE WERE GOING BACK AND FORTH, 
THEN WE FELL IN LOVE, OKAY? 
NO REALLY. 
HE WROTE ME BEAUTIFUL LETTERS 
AND THEY ARE GREAT LETTERS. 
WE FELL IN LOVE. 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? 
THEY'LL SAY, DONALD TRUMP SAID 
THEY FELL IN LOVE, HOW 
HORRIBLE. 
HOW HORRIBLE IS THAT. 
SO UNPRESIDENTIAL. 
AND I ALWAYS TELL YOU, IT'S SO 
EASY TO BE PRESIDENTIAL. 
INSTEAD OF HAVING 10,000 PEOPLE 
OUTSIDE TRYING TO GET INTO THIS 
PACKED ARENA, WE WOULD HAVE 200 
PEOPLE STANDING RIGHT THERE. 
OKAY. 
IT'S SO EASY TO BE 
PRESIDENTIAL. 
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS, THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE, 
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. 
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU ALL. 
YOU ARE GREAT AMERICANS. 
THOUSAND POINTS OF LIGHT. 
WHICH NOBODY HAS REALLY FIGURED 
OUT. 
AND THANK YOU, LADIES AND 
GENTLEMEN, HASN'T THAT BEEN 
EXCITING? 
HOW IS WEST VIRGINIA, IN THE 
MEANTIME, EVERYTHING IS GOING 
TO BE -- WE HAVE TO KEEP IT 
GOING THE WAY IT'S GOING. 
DO WE AGREE? 
DO WE AGREE? 
GET PATRICK IN THERE. 
WEHAVE TO KEEP IT GOING. 
BECAUSE WE HAVE SOMETHING GOING 
THAT NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN 
BEFORE. 
YOU KNOW, EVERY FOREIGN LEADER 
THAT COMES TO SEE ME IN THE 
WHITE HOUSE, WHICH I SEE A LOT. 
EVERY FOREIGN LEADER. 
I SEE A LOT, BECAUSE USUALLY 
THEY ARE TREATING US UNFAIRLY 
WITH MILITARY. 
WE ARE PAYING FOR THEIR 
MILITARY AND I SAY WHY? 
WE'RE REDOING ALL OF THAT. 
SAUDI ARABIA, YOU HAVE TO PAY 
FOR YOUR MILITARY. 
WE'LL BE GOOD. 
YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR YOUR 
MILITARY. 
SORRY. 
NOBODY EVER ASKED THE QUESTION. 
AND I HAVE GENERALS, YOU KNOW, 
IT'S CALLED THE MILITARY 
INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX. 
THEY ARE GREAT PEOPLE. 
THEY ARE WARRIORS, BUT NOT INTO 
THE WORLD OF FINANCE. 
I SAY GENERAL, HOW MUCH ARE 
THEY PAYING FOR MISSILES? 
SIR, WE ARE PAYING FOR IT. 
WHY? 
SIR, WE ARE PAYING BECAUSE THEY 
ARE OUR ALLIES. 
WHY ELSE? 
SIR, TRADE  WE LOST $100 
BILLION LAST YEAR. 
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? 
I'M TELLING YOU, BIG 
DIFFERENCE. 
AND YOU SEE GDP NUMBERS AT 4.2. 
WHEN WE STRAIGHTEN OUT THESE 
HORRIBLE TRADE DEALS AND 
HORRIBLE MILITARY DEALS, FORGET 
IT. 
OFF THE CHARTS. 
HOUSEHOLD INCOME AMONG HISPANIC 
AMERICANS HAS JUST SET A NEW 
RECORD HIGH. 
THINK OF THAT. 
INCOME. 
SINCE MY ELECTION, AND YOU'VE 
HEARD THIS MANY TIMES. 
I'M VERY PROUD OF IT. 
I USED TO GO AROUND, WHAT DO 
YOU HAVE TO LOSE? 
VOTE FOR ME INSTEAD OF A 
DEMOCRAT. 
VOTE FOR ME, AFRICAN AMERICAN, 
HISPANIC AMERICAN, ASIAN 
AMERICAN, HAVE ALL REACHED THE 
LOWEST LEVELS EVER RECORDED IN 
OUR HISTORY. 
RIGHT? 
RIGHT? 
THE POVERTY RATES FOR AFRICAN 
AMERICANS AND HISPANIC 
AMERICANS, IT'S BEEN 
INCREDIBLE. 
THEY HAVE ALL REACHED THEIR 
LOWEST LEVELS IN THE HISTORY OF 
OUR COUNTRY. 
THINK OF IT. 
WHO THE IS GOING TO BEAT ME? 
AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE THE 
LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN 
HISTORY. 
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY DO WELL? 
I THINK WE HAVE KANYE WEST. 
WE HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT. 
BIG JIM BROWN. 
HOW ABOUT BIG JIM BROWN. 
HOW GOOD WAS HE? 
IF HE WAS PLAYING TODAY, HE 
WOULD MAKE A TRILLION DOLLARS. 
AND HE WOULD STAND FOR THE 
FLAG, TOO, I TELL YOU. 
I KNOW HIM. 
GREAT. 
UNEMPLOYMENT FOR AMERICANS 
WITHOUT HIGH SCHOOL  DIPLOMAS. 
THAT'S A BIG THING. 
RECENTLY REACHED THE LOWEST 
RATE EVER RECORDED. 
THE WOMEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 
IN THE UNITED STATES RECENTLY 
REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE IN OVER 
65 YEARS. 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS 
PERSONAL TO YOU AND SOME OTHER 
STATES. 
WE REPEAL PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 
MORATORIUM. 
WE ENDED THE COAL CRUSHING 
STREAM PROTECTION RULE, WHICH 
WAS KILLING YOU. 
IT SOUNDS SO BEAUTIFUL. 
THE EPA IS SO-CALLED A KILLER. 
IT WAS A KILLER. 
IT WAS COSTING THIS COUNTRY A 
FORTUNE. 
IT WAS A TOTAL KILLER. 
HAS SUCH NICE NAMES, SUCH A 
NICE TITLE. 
IT PUT EVERYBODY OUT OF 
BUSINESS AND IT TOOK AWAY OUR 
STRENGTH. 
IT TOOK AWAY OUR WEALTH. 
I WENT THROUGH THE UNITED 
STATES FROM THE JOB KILLING 
VERY UNFAIR AND VERY, VERY 
EXPENSIVE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. 
A KILLER. 
THESE ARE KILLERS. 
THEY WERE PUTTING OUR COUNTRY 
OUT OF BUSINESS. 
WE HAVE ENDED THE WAR ON 
BEAUTIFUL CLEAN COAL. 
AND IN JUST THE LAST YEAR, OUR 
COAL EXPORTS HAVE SKYROCKETED. 
THIS IS EXPORTS TO OTHER 
COUNTRIES BY 60%. 
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? 
THE UNITED STATES IS NOW THE 
NUMBER ONE ENERGY PRODUCER IN 
THE WORLD. 
THAT HAPPENED JUST RECENTLY. 
A LOT OF MONEY IN THAT. 
WE'RE FIXING THE ONE SIDED 
TRADE DEALS THAT HAVE STOLEN 
AMERICAN JOBS. 
DRAINED AMERICAN WEALTH. 
IT'S BEEN A MASSIVE TRANSFER OF 
WEALTH OUT OF OUR COUNTRY. 
WE'RE BRINGING IT ALL BACK. 
THEY'RE ALL COMING BACK. 
WE'VE REACHED A DEAL TO REPLACE 
THE HORRIBLE NAFTA. 
ONE OF THE WORST TRADE DEALS 
EVER. 
WITH A BRAND-NEW U.S., MEXICO 
TRADE DEAL AND WE'LL SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS WITH CANADA, IF THEY 
COME ALONG. 
THEY HAVE TO BE FAIR. 
THEY HAVE RIGHT NOW, THEY HAVE 
TARIFFS. 
OVER 300% ON DAIRY PRODUCTS. 
THAT'S LIKE A BARRIER. 
THEY HAVE TO BE FAIR. 
WE MADE THE DEAL WITH MEXICO 
AND IT'S A GREAT DEAL FOR BOTH 
COUNTRIES. 
NAFTA WAS THE WORST DEAL. 
JUST THIS WEEK, I SIGNED A 
GROUND BREAKING NEW TRADE DEAL 
WITH SOUTH KOREA THAT WILL 
DRAMATICALLY INCREASE EXPORTS 
OF AMERICAN MADE GOODS. 
I SAID YOU HAVE TO OPEN UP YOUR 
COUNTRY. 
NOW THE DEMOCRATS WILL LOOK AT 
ANY OF THESE DEALS. 
THEY WON'T READ THEM. 
THEY WON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 
THEM. 
I GUESS I WOULD DO IT IF I WAS 
THEM AS WELL. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK? 
IT'S NO GOOD. 
IT'S TERRIBLE. 
HAVE YOU READ IT? 
THESE DEALS ARE UNBELIEVABLE. 
THESE DEALS ARE SO GOOD FOR US. 
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE 
COMPANIES LEAVING OUR COUNTRY, 
FIRING EVERYBODY, AND THEN 
SELLING THEIR PRODUCT BACK INTO 
THE UNITED STATES WITH NO 
TAXES. 
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE. 
AND THANKS TO OUR VERY STRONG 
POSITION ON TARIFFS, BECAUSE I 
WANT THEM TO NEGOTIATE WITH US. 
WE HAVE SAVED AMERICAN ALUMINUM 
AND AMERICAN STEEL COMPANIES. 
THEY ARE THRIVING. 
AMERICAN STEEL IS BUILDING 
PLANTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. 
STEEL WORKERS ARE BACK, AND THE 
MINERS ARE SUPPLYING THE METAL 
COAL. 
WE DON'T NEED FOREIGN STEEL. 
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE'RE IN A 
CONFLICT? 
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? 
GET OUR STEEL FROM SOME FOREIGN 
COUNTRY? 
WE NEED STEEL. 
WE NEED ALUMINUM. 
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS YOU 
NEED. 
WE'RE HIRING A LOT OF PEOPLE. 
YOU KNOW WHAT? 
OUR TREASURY IS GETTING LOADED 
UP WITH MONEY. 
BECAUSE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
WILL BE FLOWING IN BECAUSE WE 
CHARGE 25 WHEN THEY DUMP. 
WHEN THEY DUMP STEEL, WHAT THEY 
WANT TO DO IS PUT OUR STEEL 
COMPANIES OUT OF BUSINESS. 
THEN THEY SELL US STEEL AT 
PRICES THAT ARE SO HIGH NOBODY 
WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THAT. 
NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THE 
JOBS CREATED. 
AND NOBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT 
ALL THE MONEY THAT IS FLOWING 
IN TO THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA. 
THEY DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT 
IT. 
AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE AGAINST 
IT ARE USUALLY HAVING, YOU 
KNOW, YOU GO TO THESE OTHER 
COUNTRIES. 
THEY HAVE COMPANIES THERE. 
AND MANY OF THESE PEOPLE, WE 
LIKE FREE TRADE. 
SO I'LL SAY, EVEN TO 
CONGRESSMAN AND SENATORS, LET 
ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. 
SO WE HAVE A COUNTRY, TAKE 
INDIA. 
GOOD RELATIONSHIP. 
THEY WANT TO MAKE A DEAL NOW 
BECAUSE THEY DON'T ME TO DO 
WHAT I HAVE TO DO. 
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE A DEAL 
WITH ANYBODY ELSE. 
I SAID, SO TAKE INDIA. 
YOU TALK ABOUT FREE TRADE. 
SO LET'S SAY THEY CHARGE US 60% 
TARIFF ON A PRODUCT. 
AND FOR THE SAME PRODUCT, WHEN 
THEY SENT IT IN, WE CHARGED 
THEM NOTHING. 
SO NOW I WANT TO CHARGE THEM 
25% OR 20 OR 10 OR SOMETHING. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK? 
THAT'S NOT FREE TRADE. 
WE DON'T LIKE IT. 
I SAID WHERE ARE THESE PEOPLE 
COMING FROM? 
WHERE ARE THEY COMING FROM? 
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW DIFFICULT 
THAT IS. 
WHERE ARE THEY COMING FROM? 
SO, INDIA, JUST TO USE AS AN 
EXAMPLE. 
I COULD GIVE YOU OTHERS THAT 
ARE BRUTAL. 
JUST BRUTAL WHAT THEY DO TO US. 
HOW THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 
STUPIDITY. 
WE NEVER HAD PEOPLE NEGOTIATED. 
THEY DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. 
TAKE INDIA. 
THEY CHARGE US 60%. 
WE CHARGE THEM NOTHING. 
WHEN I SAY I'M GOING TO PUT A 
25% TARIFF ON JUST TO MAKE IT A 
LITTLE BIT FAIRER, THEY SAY 
THAT'S NOT FREE TRADE. 
I SAID WHERE DO YOU COME FROM? 
REMEMBER THIS. 
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE 
FIGHTING ME IN WHAT I'M DOING 
HAVE OWNERSHIP OF COMPANIES IN 
THESE OTHER COUNTRIES. 
REMEMBER THAT, PLEASE. 
OKAY. 
REMEMBER THAT. 
OR THEY ARE REPRESENTED BY 
LOBBIES. 
SO THE STEEL PEOPLE LOVE ME. 
THE COAL PEOPLE LOVE ME. 
MANY PEOPLE LOVE ME. 
YOU KNOW WHO LOVES ME? 
OUR COUNTRY HAS NEVER DONE 
BETTER. 
THAT'S WHO LOVES ME. 
CRAZY. 
SO TO GIVE OUR WORKERS AND 
BUSINESSES JUST IN FINISHING 
UP, A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD 
REPUBLICANS PASSED THE BIGGEST 
PACKAGE OF TAX CUTS AND REFORMS 
IN AMERICAN HISTORY. 
WE PASSED SOMETHING ELSE THAT I 
LOVE. 
RIGHT TO TRY. 
YOU KNOW WHAT RIGHT TO TRY IS? 
SOMEBODY IS TERMINALLY ILL. 
WE HAVE A PIPELINE OF SOME OF 
THE GREATEST PRODUCTS AND WE 
COULDN'T USE THEM. 
THE PERSON WILL DIE IN FOUR 
MONTHS, WE COULDN'T USE THEM. 
FOR 45 YEARS, THEY HAVE BEEN 
TRYING TO GET THIS PASSED. 
NOT THAT EASY. 
I GOT IT PASSED. 
RIGHT TO TRY. 
SOMEONE IS TERMINALLY ILL, THEY 
HAVE TO SIGN THE CLAUSE AND 
THINGS AND NOW THEY DON'T HAVE 
TO TRAVEL TO PARTS OF THE 
WORLD. 
WE PASS VETERANS CHOICE, GIVING 
OUR VETERANS THE RIGHT TO SEEK 
A PRIVATE DOCTOR IF THEY ARE 
STANDING IN LINE FOR FOUR 
WEEKS. 
THEY COULDN'T GET IT PASSED. 
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 45 
YEARS. 
THEY COULDN'T GET IT PASSED. 
VETERANS ARE OUR GREATEST 
PEOPLE. 
ANY VETERANS HERE? 
VETERANS. 
IT WAS VERY TOUGH. 
45 YEARS. 
WE GOT IT PASSED. 
SO NOW INSTEAD OF WAITING IN 
LINE FOR THREE WEEKS AND DYING 
IN MANY CASES, BELIEVE IT OR 
NOT, THEY WAIT SO LONG TO SEE A 
DOCTOR, THEY END UP BECOMING 
TERMINAL. 
THEY END UP DYING. 
THEY NOW GO OUT AND SEE A 
DOCTOR, WE PAY THE BILL, IT'S 
GREAT. 
WE PASSED IT. 
WE ALSO PASS A LANDMARK 
ACCOUNTABILITY ACT SO ALL THESE 
BAD PLAYERS IN THE VA, WE FIRE 
THEM SO FAST. 
THEY COULD DO ANYTHING. 
I JUST SIGNED LEGISLATION TO 
COMPLETELY, COMPLETELY REBUILD 
ALL OF OUR MILITARY. 
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT AND YOU 
KNOW WHAT? 
IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO ME. 
SO IMPORTANT TO ME. 
SO IMPORTANT. 
WE HAVE TANKS. 
WE HAVE SHIPS. 
WE HAVE EVERYTHING. 
SO IMPORTANT. 
AND THE PENTAGON IS WORKING 
RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK TO CREATE 
A 6th BRANCH OF THE UNITED 
STATES ARMED FORCES CALLED THE 
SPACE FORCE. 
RIGHT? 
SPACE FORCE. 
I WENT THROUGH THE UNITED 
STATES FROM THE HORRIBLE, ONE 
SIDED IRAN DEAL, AND IRAN IS 
NOT THE SAME COUNTRY RIGHT NOW, 
FOLKS. 
AND THEY BETTER NOT DO NUCLEAR. 
THEY BETTER NOT. 
IT'S NOT THE SAME COUNTRY. 
WE HAVE ALL RECOGNIZED THE TRUE 
CAPITAL OF ISRAEL. 
RECENTLY, WHEN I OPENED THE 
AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. 
AND I JUST COME FROM A 
TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL TRIP. 
I'VE DONE A LOT OF TRIPS FROM 
THE UNITED NATIONS TO SAUDI 
ARABIA TO CHINA, TO UK, 
EUROPEAN UNION, ALL OVER THE 
WORLD, AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE 
MEANS A LOT OF JOBS AND A LOT 
OF INCOME COMING INTO OUR 
COUNTRY NAY NOBODY EVER DID 
BEFORE. 
NOBODY EVER DID IT. %
I MADE CLEAR WE WILL NEVER 
SACRIFICE AMERICA'S SOVEREIGNTY 
TO AN ELECTED, UNACCOUNTABLE, 
FOREIGN BUREAUCRAT. 
I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT. 
WE REJECT THE IDEOLOGY OF 
GLOBALISM AND WE EMBRACE THE 
DOCTRINE OF, LET'S PUT IT THIS 
WAY, WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY. 
THAT'S OUR DOCTRINE. 
YOU CAN CALL IT PATRIOTISM, BUT 
IT'S REALLY THE DOCTRINE OF WE 
LOVE OUR COUNTRY. 
FOR YEARS, YOU WATCHED AS YOUR 
LEADERS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. 
NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS 
STANDING UP FOR AMERICA. 
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR YOUR 
VALUES. 
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR WEST 
VIRGINIA. 
WE ARE STANDING PROUDLY FOR OUR 
NATIONAL ANTHEM.
TO CONTINUE OUR MOMENTUM, TO 
PROTECT YOUR FAMILY, YOUR 
BORDERS, YOUR CONSTITUTION, AND 
YOUR COUNTRY, YOU NEED TO GET 
YOUR FRIENDS, GET YOUR FAMILY, 
GET YOUR COWORKERS, AND GET OUT 
AND VOTE FOR PATRICK MORRISEY. 
GET OUT AND VOTE REPUBLICAN. 
AND IF YOU AREN'T REGISTERED, 
REGISTER RIGHT NOW. 
YOU HAVE TO REGISTER HERE. 
AND THE DEADLINE TO REGISTER IS 
OCTOBER 16. 
HATE TO BREAK UP THIS BY SAYING 
THAT, BUT THOSE ARE THE FACTS. 
REGISTER. 
OCTOBER 16, LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE 
YOU HELPED BUILD THIS COUNTRY. 
AND TOGETHER, WE ARE TAKING 
BACK OUR COUNTRY AND RETURNING 
POWER TO WHERE IT BELONGS, TO 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
THIS GREAT STATE WAS BUILT BY 
TOUGH PIONEER MEN AND STRONG 
PIONEER WOMEN. 
THESE BRAVE WEST VIRGINIA 
PATRIOTS VENTURED OUT INTO THE 
WILDERNESS AND UP INTO THE 
MOUNTAINS TO BUILD A BEAUTIFUL 
HOME. 
A LIFE, AND A DREAM. 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 
MONEY. 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF 
LUXURY. 
BUT THEY ALL HAD ONE THING IN 
COMMON. 
THEY LOVED THEIR FAMILIES. 
THEY LOVE THEIR COUNTRY. 
AND THEY LOVE THEIR GOD. 
TRUE. 
WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF 
THESE COURAGEOUS AMERICANS. 
YOUR ANCESTORS DID NOT POUR OUT 
THEIR BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS, 
SO THAT WE COULD SIT AT HOME 
WHILE OTHERS TRY TO ERASE THEIR 
LEGACY AND DESTROY OUR PROUD 
AMERICAN HERITAGE. 
THAT'S WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
TRYING TO DO WITH THEIR CRAZY 
POLICIES. 
JUST LIKE THE PIONEERS AND 
PATRIOTS WHO CAME BEFORE US. 
WE ARE GOING TO WORK. 
WE ARE GOING TO FIGHT. 
WE ARE GOING TO WIN FOR OUR 
FAMILIES, FOR OUR FLAG, AND FOR 
OUR FREEDOM. 
THE REVOLUTION THAT YOU BEGAN 
IN 2016, AND IT WAS A 
REVOLUTION AND EVEN THESE 
PEOPLE WILL ADMIT THAT. 
THAT WAS A REVOLUTION LIKE THEY 
HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. 
THAT WAS A REVOLUTION THAT WAS 
-- THEY CAME FROM THE HILLS AND 
 
THEY CAME FROM EVERYWHERE. 
AND AT THE END OF THAT EVENING, 
THEY SAID, I HATE TO TELL YOU 
THIS, A LOT OF BAD THINGS ARE 
HAPPENING TONIGHT FOR THE 
DEMOCRATS. 
THAT WAS ONE OF THE GREAT 
EVENINGS. 
NOT BECAUSE OF ME, BUT BECAUSE 
OF YOU. 
THAT WAS ONE OF THE GREAT 
EVENINGS IN THE HISTORY OF OUR 
COUNTRY. 
AND IT'S FAR FROM OVER. 
IT'S ONLY JUST BEGINNING. 
WE WILL NOT BEND. 
WE WILL NOT BREAK. 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE IN. 
WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP. 
WE WILL NEVER BACK DOWN. 
WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER. 
AND WE WILL ALWAYS FIGHT ON TO 
VICTORY, VICTORY, VICTORY. 
BECAUSE WE ARE AMERICA. 
AND OUR HEARTS BLEED RED, 
WHITE, AND BLUE. 
WE ARE ONE PEOPLE. 
ONE FAMILY. 
AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER 
GOD. 
AND TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE 
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG 
AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE 
AGAIN. 
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
THANK YOU WEST VIRGINIA. 
THANK YOU.

>>> THIS WEEK'S INSTALLMENT OF 
LONDON CALLING, THE BRITISH 
GOVERNMENT IS APOLOGIZING FOR A 
BLOOD CONTAMINATION SCANDAL 
THAT LED TO  DISEASE AND 
DEATHS. 
SIMON TAKES A LOOK BACK AT WHAT 
HAPPENED. 
>>  Reporter: THIS IS A 
TERRIBLE STORY THAT DECADES AGO 
CAUSED THE DEATHS OF UP TO 
3,000 BRITISH PEOPLE AND MAYBE 
TENS AND THOUSANDS MORE IN THE 
FUTURE. 
THIS IS FACTOR 8. IT'S PRODUCED 
FROM HUMAN BLOOD AND IT HELPS 
THE BLOOD TO CLOT. 
BACK IN THE 1970s, THE BRITISH 
GOVERNMENT BEGAN IMPORTING IT. 
MAINLY FROM AMERICA. 
IT WAS USED TO SAVE THE LIVES 
OF HEMOPHILIACS AND THOSE GIVEN 
BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS AFTER 
ACCIDENTS OR CHILDBIRTH. 
IT WAS A PROBLEM. 
A TERRIFYING PROBLEM. 
MUCH OF THE BLOOD THAT PRODUCED 
FACTOR VIII WAS INFECTED WITH 
HIV OR AIDS. 
DRUG ADDICTS WERE PAID TO 
DONATE. 
THE FIGURES ARE STAGGERING. 
BECAUSE AS ALL THE BLOOD WAS 
MIXED TOGETHER, IT ONLY TOOK 
ONE INFECTED DONOR TO 
CONTAMINATE A HUGE BATCH. 
BY THE MID 1980s, FACTOR VIII 
WAS HEAT TREATED. 
BUT FOR THOUSANDS OF BRITISH 
VICTIMS, THIS WAS TOO LATE. 
THIS WEEK, A PUBLIC INQUIRY 
OPENED AMID ACCUSATIONS OF A 
POLITICAL COVERUP. 
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE INQUIRY 
SAID THAT THERE MAY BE 25,000 
PEOPLE ALIVE TODAY WHO DON'T 
EVEN REALIZE THAT THEY HAVE 
HEPATITIS C OR HIV. 
THINK OF THAT. 
HUGE NUMBERS OF SPOUSES, 
CHILDREN, AND EVEN 
GRANDCHILDREN INFECTED ENTIRELY 
INNOCENTLY BY THEIR RELATIVES. 
ALL CAUSED BY THE TAINTED 
FACTOR VIII THAT CONTINUES TO 
KILL. 
AS LONDON CALLING FOR THIS 
WEEK, THIS IS SIMON BATES FOR 
CBS NEWS IN LONDON. 
>>> THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
MADE A STARTLING ADMISSION 
ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE LAST 
MONTH. 
THE WASHINGTON POST FOUND A 
WARNING HIDDEN IN A 500 PAGE 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT 
FROM THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY 
TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION. 
IT SAID THE TEMPERATURE OF THE 
PLANET WILL RISE 7 DEGREES BY 
THE YEAR 20100. 
A CHANGE COULD LEAVE PARTS OF 
MIAMI UNDER WATER. 
THE REPORT SAYS IT'S TOO LATE 
TO STOP IT. 
WITH MEASURES LIKE INCREASED 
FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS, THE 
PRESIDENT REPEATEDLY EXPRESSED 
SKEPTICISM THAT CLIMATE CHANGE 
IS REAL. 
HE CALLED IT A HOAX. 
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS NOT 
COMMENTED. 
>>> A NEW STARTUP THINKS IT 
FOUND THE WAY TO SAVE A 
FALTERING JOURNALISM INDUSTRY. 
MANY NEWSPAPERS SEEN FINANCIAL 
TROUBLES IN THE INTERNET AGE. 
ONE COMPANY'S PLAN WOULD HAVE 
NORMAL PEOPLE BUYING SHARES IN 
NEWSROOMS. 
>>  TO SEE A CORPORATE OWNER 
DECIMATE THE NEWS STAFF OF THE 
DAILY NEWS IS BACK FOR NEW YORK 
CITY. 
>>  THERE'S NOTHING UNUSUAL 
ABOUT NEW YORK'S MAYOR, BILL DE 
BLASIO BEING INTERVIEWED. 
HOW THIS KIND OF JOURNALISM IS 
BEING FUNDED. 
BY A FIRM CALLED CIVIL MEDIA 
COMPANY, WHOSE CEO IS MATTHEW 
AISLES. 
>>  WE'VE HAD 28 YEARS OR MORE 
OF  DIGITAL MEDIA BEING RUN BY 
GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK THAT DO NOT 
CARE ABOUT JOURNALISM AND HAVE 
BUSINESS MODELS ABOUT SERVING 
YOU ADS. 
IT'S HARMING  JOURNALISM IN A 
SERIOUS WAY. 
>>  FROM CHICAGO TO SINGAPORE. 
AS THE FOOTPRINT OF TRADITIONAL 
NEWSPAPERS IS SHRINKING, 
CIVIL'S FOOTPRINT IS GROWING. 
THE GOAL IS A MARKETPLACE FOR 
NEWS OWNED AND OPERATED BY 
JOURNALISTS AND CITIZENS FUNDED 
IN PART BY CRYPTO CRUSH SI. 
>>   CRYPTO CURRENCY. 
>>  TOKEN HOLDERS WILL HAVE A 
VOTE ON WHO CAN PUBLISH. 
>>  THE INFORMATION IS ARCHIVED 
USING BLOCK CHAIN. 
TO CENTRALIZE AND PUBLICLY 
OWNED ONLINE STORAGE. 
A WAY TO KEEP FACTS IN THE OPEN 
AND HACKERS OUT. 
>>  THE IMMUTABLE NATURE MAKES 
IT NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE FOR 
ANYONE, INCLUDING GOVERNMENTS, 
CORPORATIONS, BILLIONAIRES, TO 
HACK THE BLOCK CHAIN AND CHANGE 
SOME FACT OR RECORD OR 
INFORMATION IN THE PAST. 
SOMETIMES JUNIOR  JOURNALISM IS 
USED BY BLOCK CHAIN, WE CAN 
IMPRINT INTO A PERMANENT AND 
IMMUTABLE ARCHIVE. 
>>  THIS IS ONE OF CIVIL'S 
FIRST TEST TUBES. 
A GROUP OF SEVEN REPORTERS AND 
THREE EDITORS IN DENVER, 
COLORADO, WHO ALL ONCE WORKED 
AT THE DENVER POST, SHARED 
PRIZES FOR COVERAGE THERE. 
BUT ALL LEFT AMID CUTBACKS AND 
LAYOFFS MANDATED BY ITS HEDGE 
FUND OWNERS WHOSE DEMAND FOR 
HIGHER PROFITS DECIMATED THE 
NEWSROOM. 
NOW THEY CREATE THE COLORADO 
SUN, NEARLY THREE WEEKS OLD 
WITH SEED MONEY FROM CIVIL. 
LORI IS EDITOR OF THE SUN. 
>>  WE BEGAN THOSE 
CONVERSATIONS. 
IT WAS EXCITING TO BE DREAMING 
OF BUILDING SOMETHING NEW 
RATHER THAN TO BE COLLABORATING 
IN THE DESTRUCTION OF A PROUD 
NEWSPAPER. 
>>  I GET DREAMING, BUT MONEY 
COUNTS. 
DID THEY HELP YOU WITH THE 
MONEY AS WELL? 
>>  YES, MONEY DOES COUNT. 
CIVIL HAS BEEN VERY GENEROUS 
WITH US SO FAR. 
THEY PROVIDED ENOUGH RUNWAY TO 
GET UP AND MAKE OUR CASE TO THE 
PEOPLE OF COLORADO, BECAUSE AT 
THE END OF THE DAY, WE'RE NOT 
GOING TO BE ABLE TO COUNT ON 
CIVIL TO FINANCE US FOR EVER 
AND EVER. 
>>  THE SUN HAS REPORTED ON HOW 
COLORADO'S GOVERNOR FORMED A 
PACK, AS A POSSIBLE RUN FOR 
PRESIDENT. 
A CLIMBER REMAKING HIS LIFE 
AFTER A DEVASTATING FALL AND A 
DOZEN SURGERIES. 
AND A PIECE ON THE SOUTH PLATT 
RIVER REPORTED BY KEVIN 
SIMPSON. 
ON THIS DAY, HE WAS DOING 
INTERVIEWS FOR HIS STORY, MUCH 
LIKE HE DID AS A VETERAN 
REPORTER FOR THE DENVER POST, 
WHERE HE SPENT 33 YEARS AND 
BATTLED CANCER. 
THERE ARE A FEW DIFFERENCES. 
HE WORKS FROM A HOME OFFICE, 
NOT A NEWSROOM. 
AND ANOTHER BIG CHANGE, THE JOB 
IS FUN AGAIN. 
>>  HAS THIS ENERGIZED, 
REENERGIZED YOU TO BE A 
JOURNALIST? 
>>  IT ABSOLUTELY HAS. 
IT'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
WORKING FOR SOMEBODY ELSE AND 
WORKING FOR YOURSELF. 
THIS IS OUR BABY. 
IT WILL RISE OR FALL ON OUR 
EFFORTS AND THAT IS ENERGIZING. 
IT'S ALSO A LITTLE FRIGHTENING. 
BUT OVERALL, IT'S A GREAT 
FEELING. 
>>  JOURNALISM IS EXPENSIVE. 
AND THE SUN INSISTS ON PAYING 
REPORTERS REAL SALARIES. 
>>  YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL 
PASSIONATE ABOUT JOURNALISM, 
BUT WE ALL HAVE LIVES AND 
MORTGAGES AND RENT TO PAY AND 
KIDS IN COLLEGE AND ALL OF 
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. 
WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE IN THAT 
THE COLORADO SUN HAS BEEN ABLE 
TO PROVIDE ALL OF US WITH 
SALARIES THAT ARE COMPARABLE TO 
WHAT WE WERE MAKING AT THE 
DENVER POST OR IN SOME CASES 
EVEN MORE THAN WE EARNED AT THE 
DENVER POST. 
>>  TO PAY ITS WAY AS CIVIL 
FUNDING TAPERS OFF, IT WILL 
DEPEND ON COMMUNITY AND 
CORPORATE SPONSORS. 
>>  FOR NOW, WE REALLY ARE 
USING MORE OF A NATIONAL PUBLIC 
RADIO, PUBLIC TELEVISION MODEL, 
WHICH IS TO SAY TO A COMPANY, 
WE AREN'T GOING TO HELP YOU 
SELL MATTRESSES OR THE FOURTH 
OF JULY OR WASHINGTON'S DAY OR 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 
BUT IF YOU BELIEVE IN OUR 
MISSION AND YOU BELIEVE IN OUR 
COMPANY, THEN WE WOULD BE HAPPY 
TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT. 
>>  JOURNALISTS HAVE BECOME 
ACCUSTOMED TO REPORTING BAD 
NEWS ABOUT THEIR STRUGGLING 
PROFESSION. 
IF CIVIL WORKS IN COLORADO AND 
ELSEWHERE, IT MAY BE A RARE 
MOMENT FOR REPORTERS THESE 
DAYS, A STORY ABOUT JOURNALISM 
WITH A HAPPY ENDING.
