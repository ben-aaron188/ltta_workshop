to the raucous moment on the House floor
yesterday after House Republicans voted
down a democratic effort to increase
election security funding take a look to
defend our Constitution gentleman's time
has expired
all enemies foreign and domestic
gentleman's time has expired you have
the opportunity to do that today do so
yes on this amendment for your country
this now a member of the Foreign Affairs
and Judiciary Committee's Democratic
congressman Ted Deutsch a Florida
congressman what what happened with that
vote yesterday and why did Republicans
vote against a bill to fund election
security and will the Republicans say
well we have our own version of that
bill that will protect election security
just as much as the Democrats
well thanks Jeff first of all no they're
not going to say they have their own
bill that there's no good answer
for the fact that every Republican in
the House of Representatives voted
yesterday against additional funding for
election security and a vote that took
place at the end of a week when the
president started the week by showing
that he was with Putin and instead of
with America and a week after just a
week after the indictment came down that
showed the extent of this hacking and
what the Russians were trying to do what
the response of the pathetic response I
must say to this language that would
have added funding to go to our state's
to help prevent cyberattacks from the
Russians the response from a lot of my
Republican colleagues was we shouldn't
be doing that if we want to protect our
elections we ought to pass more voter ID
laws it's tone-deaf it's unpatriotic it
is inexplicable and I heard you a little
earlier Joe you're right good luck going
home and trying to explain to your
constituents why the week that we saw
the president on stage with Putin the
week we discussed their efforts to
attack our democracy and the way they
did attack our democracy we want nothing
to do with preventing it from happening
again we've been we've been talking a
lot this morning about what the
Democrats message could and should be
this coming fall and in 2020 you know we
see with her polling that a lot of
Republicans now seemed if favored
dealing with Vladimir Putin they approve
of the president's performance this week
why do you think this is so important
why do you think is this an issue you
guys can actually run on well it's sure
and we're not going to run on election
secure
and funding for it but but in the the
big picture look what's the message
people want to be they're proud
Americans want to be proud of their
government they're not proud of this
government and that's not true just four
Republican four Democrats four
Republicans - it's true because of the
way
the president talks about women the
numbers that the discussion about
millennial women who's surprised that
millennial women don't like a president
given the way he talks about women it's
true as they look at that the
president's standing on stage people
want to be proud and know that the
president is standing up for our
national security not standing on stage
looking like someone who's a pawn for
Vladimir Putin sure I want to ask you
something course I felt I actually
emotionally felt something on the USA
USA it was what I was talking about
before and what the message needs to be
it's a vote for democracy it's a vote
for freedom and I want to bring him
we've back to what Patrick said I
couldn't agree with him more it's about
the women and if you do an air that says
to a young millennial woman this is what
your grandmother fought for fight for
your own granddaughter and what we stand
for and it's up to you to protect us no
so it's not about voting but it's that
emotion that happened in Congress
yesterday if you can gin that up in the
base and you don't trash Trump and you
don't talk about how he treats women
it's just about who we are it's the vote
of a lifetime that's what I saw
happening with the Congress yes I know
people are cynical about politics and I
understand that a lot of people will
watch that and think it's just for show
but there is this sense of patriotism
you saw it some of my Republican
colleagues realized what was going on
and jumped to their feet it's impossible
not to want to stand up right now at
this moment for our democracy I agree
with you standing for our democracy
making sure that our votes will be
protected really matters but also Doni
those the same women also care about the
fact that this president is tearing kids
from their parents at the border that
resonates with they care about the fact
that that the administration is
hell-bent on taking away health care
coverage for people with pre-existing
conditions
all of that matters to them but it all
comes from this deep places of
patriotism and frustration I bet they're
not there you talked about people being
cynical there are people that might look
at that video and say well this is
grandstanding from Democrats who just
wanted to make a show because they
couldn't actually pass the bill
what is the plan now going forward as
president Trump supporters are following
him they're saying Vladimir Putin should
be someone that we're close to what are
Democrats going to do now if you don't
have the votes to pass legislation well
it's first of all it's really important
to point out I don't know I I think that
assertion that Republicans are falling
in line behind the President on his
relationship with Vladimir Putin not
from what I've seen and if you look at
the tweet series I'm talking about I'm
sorry I was talking about the Trump
supporters oh sure and and I saw though
we all saw those polls a lot of Trump
supporters think that the president is
right on I'm not going to try to
convince everyone that that when the
president stands on stage and seems to
care more about Vladimir Putin and be
there to do his bidding instead of
standing up for Americans national
security I can't convince everyone I
know that the overwhelming majority if
people watched the president on stage
and were horrified by what they saw I'm
going to continue we're going to
continue to talk to those people and
talk about what we need to do to to
address this issue we're gonna look back
on this summer I'm convinced we're gonna
look back on this summer in history and
the way the president did the work of
Vladimir Putin not just standing next to
him but he attacked the g7 he went to
NATO and attacked NATO he stood up and
attacked our allies specifically the he
attacked the EU
that's what Vladimir Putin wants him to
do it's not about having a good
relationship with Russia it's not even
just about sanctions we've imposed
sanctions we dragged the president
kicking and screaming to do it but we've
imposed sanctions but when we impose
sanctions and then the president goes
into a closed-door meeting with Vladimir
Putin has what some conversation that we
have no idea that the Director of
National Intelligence has no idea what
it was about
that's something that everyone is
nervous about everyone understands the
threat that it it provides all right
congressman Ted Deutsch thank you so
much for being with us and of course the
congressman would like us to let
everybody in his district know no
relation to Donny yeah a lot of child
psychologists have said publicly they
say this amounts to child abuse is this
child abuse being imposed enforced by
the American government I think that we
have 2,000 children who need our care in
terms of being righted with their
parents and we're working very hard on
doing that that's the Secretary of
Homeland Security a Kristen Nilson
speaking with NBC's Peter Alexander and
Aspen up next we're gonna be bringing in
Jacob Soboroff who's early reporting on
the government's child separation policy
pulled back the curtain on the crisis
and you heard the secretary say there
2,000 children are still separated from
their parents we'll dig more into that
