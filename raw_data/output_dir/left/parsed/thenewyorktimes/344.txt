“There is now nowhere left
for you to hide, Larry.”
More than 160 women say Larry
Nassar sexually abused them.
It’s one of the worst
sexual abuse scandals
in the history of sports.
And it went on for 
more than two decades.
How did he get away with it?
“My real interest, of course,
with dance and gymnastics
is my role with U.S.A. Gymnastics.”
Nassar had celebrity-like
status in the elite gymnastics
and sports medicine world.
U.S.A. Gymnastics gave him
countless awards.
He was inducted into Michigan
State University’s
hall of fame and governors appointed
him to state licensing boards.
He even secured a patent
for an ankle brace he invented.
Nassar’s patients felt honored
to be treated by 
the best of the best.
Nassar typically carried out
his abuse under the guise
of a medical treatment.
He hijacked a rare
pelvic therapy,
that involves
vaginal penetration,
and used it to treat
all sorts of ailments.
He ignored protocol, such as
using a glove, asking consent
or having a medical
chaperone present.
“And when I was 14 years old,
I tore my hamstring in my right leg.
This was when he started
performing the procedure
that we are all
now familiar with.”
“The next visit was for my shoulder,
which I then found out
my hips were out of alignment,
which then made my spine
and my pelvic bone
out of alignment as well.
And this is when Larry decided
that it was medically acceptable
to violate a 16-year-old girl.”
When confronted by parents, coaches,
and eventually investigators,
Nassar said patients may have
misunderstood his therapy.
Medical colleagues
deferred to his expertise
After a 2014 investigation
cleared his name,
Nassar was just reminded
to follow procedures.
In the training camps
of elite gymnastics,
where coaches are 
notoriously hard on athletes,
Nassar manipulated girls
into believing he
was a trusted friend, advocate
and even their protector.
“You have to protect your athletes.
You have to let them know
that we care.
You have to, not let them know,
but let them feel it.
Let them understand it.
Let them breathe it.”
”He put my picture up
on his wall with Olympians.
I thought I mattered
to Larry.”
“You had me so wrapped
around your finger,
and I still trusted you
so much.
Even when I was a sophomore
in college,
and you were the only
person I called
to help me make the
decision to end my
gymnastics career due
to my injuries.
Nassar won over family members
by offering a free treatment,
a quick diagnosis, or often
the pretense of transparency.
“At the end of the
appointment in your basement,
I remember asking, ‘Do
I owe you anything?’
Now it seems kind of sick.
You got what you wanted.”
He frequently molested
young girls with parents
in the room, using a
draped towel or practiced
positioning to conceal where
his fingers were massaging.
“What kind of a person
has the audacity
to sexually assault a child
in front of their mother?”
It’s still unclear
who knew what when,
but for decades
Nassar’s employers
focused on their
reputations and failed
to safeguard the young
women in their care.
When U.S.A. Gymnastics got a
complaint about Nassar in 2016,
the organization paid
the gymnast $1.25 million
to stop her from
speaking about the abuse.
Complaints about
Nassar’s treatments
reached officials at
Michigan State University
as early as 1997,
The Detroit News has
reported. That’s 20
years before the prized
doctor was terminated.
MSU has said that no
one at the University
believed that Nassar
committed sexual abuse prior
to the newspaper reports
in the summer of 2016.
Nassar’s victims say that if
the university had investigated
the first complaint,
scores of young girls
may have escaped
the doctor’s abuse.
“Larry Nassar did not
arise in isolation.
Rather we saw the worst sexual
assault scandal in history
unfold because a predator was
left in power for decades.
Despite warning signs,
despite red flags, despite
direct reports of assault.”
