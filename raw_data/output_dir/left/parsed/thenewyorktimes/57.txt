Two Russians have been accused
of an assassination attempt
using a nerve agent
called Novichok.
The target was
Sergei Skripal,
a former Russian spy
living in Britain.
He’s filmed here
in a local shop,
days before he was targeted.
He and his daughter Yulia
fell seriously ill from
exposure to Novichok, 
but survived.
Security footage allowed police 
to track the two suspected hit men
as they entered Britain and scoped
out their target over two days.
March 2:
They fly from Moscow to
London’s Gatwick Airport.
They check into a
hotel in East London.
March 3:
They take public
transport to Salisbury
where Mr. Skripal lived.
They stake out their target
for several hours.
March 4:
They return to
Salisbury by train.
Minutes later,
a camera films them
walking past this gas station
just a short walk
to Mr. Skripal’s home.
This was moments before
their attack, police say.
They’re transporting the nerve
agent in a perfume bottle.
It’s then sprayed on 
the front door handle
of Mr. Skripal’s house.
Soon after, the men
are seen returning
to Salisbury train station.
They’re last seen that evening
at Heathrow Airport.
At 10:30 p.m. they leave
London for Moscow.
By then, Mr. Skripal and
his daughter had been found
unresponsive on a park bench.
They were hospitalized
and eventually recovered.
Months later,
two Salisbury residents
found the discarded
perfume bottle
and were also hospitalized.
Dawn Sturgess died from
exposure and her partner,
Charlie Rowley,
became seriously ill.
Police believe the two hit men
traveled under aliases
and have asked Russia
for help identifying them.
