this week on Vice we go to North Korea
but we'll be there uncovering the news
culture
expose the absurdity of the modern
condition serve us well Drake check up
game
she's a casual
we hear advice have been fascinated by
North Korea for a long time in fact
we've done three documentaries about the
Hermit Kingdom all of which have been
harshly critical of the resume you have
to go to the house of the people the
library of the commode
you have to see the soccer team of the
video but the one thing that we didn't
do was meet any of the actual people of
North Korea it's not very busy for that
reason I'm personally never allowed to
go back to the DPRK but we wanted to get
inside the country again to see
firsthand how its faring under its new
very young and very mysterious leader
Kim jong-un one of the biggest
challenges in dealing with North Korea
on any level is that we have virtually
no diplomatic relations with them in
fact over the past 65 plus years only a
handful of Americans have ever met the
country's leaders the most prominent of
which was Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright during a visit to the country
when she brought Kim jong-il a
basketball signed by Michael Jordan now
she did this because despite his public
disdain for America Kim jong-il
privately loved the Chicago Bulls his
passion for the 90 0 Bulls was passed on
to his son Kim jong-un and banking on
the dynasties inherent love for
basketball we worked through official
and back channels to propose a goodwill
game of basketball with North Korea's
national team if they accepted we would
bring three members of the Harlem
Globetrotters were the most natural
ambassadors of goodwill in the game and
a real live Chicago Bull much to our
surprise it worked
the DPRK actually invited our delegates
to come to North Korea and participate
in a very very rare quote-unquote
foreign sports exchange program the
timing however turned out to be very
tricky because in December of 2012 North
Korea launched the quang ninh song three
satellite into the school
stirring fears that the country's
missile program could soon be advanced
enough to carry a nuclear weapon as far
as the United States and just so we
didn't forget exactly what these
missiles would be carrying they
conducted a third nuclear test to make
sure we got the message
this of course said the international
community on edge so in the midst of
heightened tensions and heated rhetoric
we headed to Pyongyang to see if we
could actually engage with the North
Koreans to the cultural vehicle of
basketball second you land in North
Korea
you realize you're no longer in control
of anything
government mongers direct your every
step you're told where to go what to do
and most importantly what to film and as
other Westerners have found out the hard
way if you flaunt these restrictions you
could wind up in North Korean Jail one
of the worst places on earth
since our instincts are usually to shoot
the exact opposite of what people want
us to I was more than a bit freaked out
having the Harlem Globetrotters along
with us on this trip was extremely
comforting because they were some of the
most positive guys we've ever met and I
needed that comfort pretty much right
away because as soon as we entered the
hotel lobby we were welcomed by a banner
celebrating the recent nuclear test
at first we thought the banner might
have been put there for us but when I
opened up the curtains for my first look
at yang I saw a line of buses leaving
the hotel and then I turned on the TV
some touch to unit a nuclear scientist
from the February caused a stir staying
at this hotel right now they were
brought here I've I have kind of a
reward or some sort of celebration
settling so we weren't even there for a
few hours and this international nuclear
controversy with huge geopolitical
ramifications was playing out in our
hotel lobby
he just always has to hold that out for
practice from the start we were under
very close supervision they were
watching us and what we were shooting at
all times I mean it has a schedule we
have a lot of blinders whose full-time
jobs it is to make sure they want to
make sure that we stay on this guy's
also army to people they're waiting for
you yes you're onto the bus we were
always surrounded by guides and
translators and officials many of whom
we'd been warned were actually secret
police we'd agreed that along with the
exhibition game we post a basketball
camp with what we thought would be a
bunch of kids in a high school gym
somewhere instead we were ushered into a
massive 10,000 seat stadium we'd also be
working with the best under 18 players
in the country my name is Anthony
Blake's
also known as buckets I'm number 15 with
the world-famous Harlem Globetrotters
we're gonna show you guys some great
things today and I'll hopefully give you
an opportunity to learn something new as
well as make some new friends with us on
my whistle first guy goes so they have
to compete for the rebound
as we were leaving we spotted North
Korea's most famous basketball player
Lee Myung Han who had come out to watch
the drills Rhee was at one time the
tallest man in basketball who was super
excited about our visit and he gathered
us together for a chat in the country
that's known to suffer from malnutrition
and the stunted growth that goes along
with it
Rhee is truly an exception in fact his
height actually attracted the interest
of American Scouts but due to trade
sanctions he was unable to pursue his
dreams of playing in the NBA and
although loyal to North Korea when he
was once asked how he felt about not
being able to play in the NBA he replied
I'm not interested in money or politics
as a sportsman I just want to try
as one of the trade-offs for allowing us
to visit through this sports exchange we
agreed to go on their state sanctioned
tour and like the beginning of any tour
of North Korea our first stop was an
obligatory visit to the Sun Palace where
the country's last two leaders lion
State North Korea is the last the
socialist-slash-communist cult of
personality utopian States and much like
Stalin in the Soviet Union or Mao and
China their leaders are not only revered
as political figures but flat-out
worshipped as gods Kim il-sung was
installed by the Soviets as the first
supreme leader in 1948 and in fact he's
still president of the DPRK today even
though he's been dead since 1994 Nelson
was succeeded by his son Kim jong-il who
inherited his father's godlike
excellence and he was perfect at
everything not only was he the greatest
at military strategy and City Planning
but also at filmmaking furniture design
and even animal husbandry when Kim
jong-il died in 2011 leadership was
passed to his son kim jeong-hoon about
whom the world knows very very little
these state sanctioned tours of North
Korea tend to be exactly the same year
in year out but because of our
basketball mission and our documentary
they created a new hand-tailored
propaganda tour they were going to show
us how great the quality of life North
Korea really was so instead of taking us
to places like the most militarized
border on earth the DMZ they took us to
the North Korean version of Sea World
immediately we knew we were stepping
into something completely different a
huge crowd was already seated and
waiting patiently for us to arrive
even here we will remind it North
Korea's nuclear prowess
and interestingly Kim taehoon was not
just trying to date if the mastermind
behind all penises and bombs he was also
the choreographer of the dolphin show
not only is Kim jong-eun great with
dolphins
he's now personally responsible for
inspecting advising and directing all
aspects of North Korean life
I am W infinity take the different
provinces and it doesn't
any machine we see with a red placard
like that
are there ever arguments over who gets
to use the marshals equipment
what do you think is the most popular
sport oh we came on the right mission
money at the end of the day we were
invited to indulge ourselves in a North
Korean shopping spree the wall was
clearly a showpiece designed to project
an abundance of delicacies in a country
that doesn't even have enough food to
feed its people the stores rammed with
Western products and a very very
attentive sales staff Doritos ruffles
and I think much again good info I'm
person ago if don't I love coke do you
like her tear at the credit card
oh no it would have felt just like a
store at home if it weren't for the fact
that a we were the only customers there
and Z I couldn't actually buy anything
as we drove back to the hotel I noticed
that in spite of the country's
well-documented chronic power shortages
this city was extremely well lit which
made me think were even the lights part
of the tour as well that might sound
crazy but when you look at satellite
photos of the region North Korea is
completely dark
the next morning we were driven to the
International friendship exhibition and
the only cars that we saw on the long
three-hour drive there were our own the
International friendship exhibition is
basically this castle vault built into
the side of a mountain that holds every
gift ever given to the leadership of
North Korea they had gifts from the
likes of Moammar Ghadafi Leonid Brezhnev
the Sandinistas and of course Madeleine
Albright whose gift of a Michael Jordan
sign basketball was the inspiration for
this trip a trip by the way that was
getting progressively weirder as we saw
in our next stops the Kim il-sung
University and grand people's study
house after the prerequisite display
nuclear and missile technology they gave
us a tour demonstrating North Korea's
openness to the outside world
this is the golden chance to have
conversations because natures how long
have you okay well I have been playing
basketball since I was a small child I
have been playing basketball for about
five days now next they took us to a
computer lab where students were using
the Internet
and your first thought is okay this
looks like any lab in a university back
home but then it dawns on you that it's
completely silent no one is doing
anything
there was no typing no mouse clicking
nothing
we saw one guy looking at the Google
homepage but he wasn't searching for
anything he was just staring blankly at
the screen the one person we saw there
who actually looked like he knew how to
use a computer was of course the one
person they wanted us to meet
very nice features well sorry to disturb
you while you're working
yes I was looking for my papers it's a
forest in there and Jones this is a
pastor in theory this is done in
collaboration with some foreign
scientists in your own
considering North Korea's reputation for
complete and total suppression of
information this stop was clearly
designed to convince us that they had
access to the Internet just like the
rest of the world which we knew wasn't
true and that left us wondering was
anything we were seeing real it felt
like we were walking through a real live
Truman Show created just for us
everywhere we went and everything he saw
was constructed to convey the exact
opposite of what we know about North
Korea I honestly felt like I was losing
my mind but nothing could have prepared
us for what was about to happen next
so we're here just a quick pickup game
super casual really relaxed with few
Harlem Globetrotters
but North Koreans and myself Dennis
Rodman is came gentlemen watch a moose
run out why the team captain you are
like him and then you can if you pick
one player I'm the equipment manager
okay we pick teams playground style so
each team had both Americans and
let's do it team on three I'm starting
what you did on
after the halftime show
the Globetrotters went out and did what
they do
usually or less all boats for Yasuda
Raghav Raja Ram Gouda Yama
shoe hola Miguel Kissimmee down then
really intense and actually started to
get outside
with no overtime game actually ended in
a tie
before we even knew what was going on
dennis was standing and giving a speech
first of all I would like to say thank
you one toe comes out on another ha
bleep stand up you guys have been very
very kind to me and to my compadres from
America and one thing always Selma cut
this really short I'm very very
privileged to be here and for you guys
to recept us as one of you is an honor
I'm sorry that you know my country in
your country are not on good terms but
for me and the country you have a France
to life sir
thank you your friend for life because I
can Giga watt seem attended a so you got
a Sangha Hamidah Khurana toten hosen
immonen to each in women to noon come
here and we'll move to England who
travel single Amida come down
we're in a complete and total days the
two hours of screaming and emotion the
tie game at the final buzzer and of
course the surprise visit by kim jungeun
it was truly a surreal experience all of
a sudden we were ushered off the court
and into the locker room and told to
change right away we were bused across
the city but no one knew where we were
going no one not even our minders we
were told to leave our cameras behind
and brought into this large marble
building and escorted through a ton of
security and then we turned a corner to
see Kim jong-eun
Martin intervention occasionally so some
entertaining hulago Olympian s or with
another penguin an e-book MBA agents
from Sweden area margin and Montana a
totodile shelf need there we were
face-to-face with Kim jong-eun for a
dinner celebration and with that we were
somehow the first Americans to meet
North Korea's new leader sidelines for
the game is one thing but standing right
beside him was completely and totally
insane
it was like being in an alternate
universe so here's what happened at
first introductory speeches were given
the theme of which was pretty much drink
then the curtains went up and out came
this all-girl band dressed in white with
electric violins and there inexplicably
plain
then things started to get really crazy
at one point Dennis took the mic and
sang my way while our interpreter played
the sax then they pointed at me and it
was my turn the tote so I thanked him
gentleman for his hospitality and said
that we'd like to return the favor if he
ever wanted to come to America and have
dinner with us which thankfully got a
big laugh
clearly the booths loosened everyone up
what we kept hearing from these
ministers party officials and nuclear
negotiators and then even from Kim
jong-un himself was that they hoped our
visit would be able to reduce some of
the psychological barriers between the
u.s. and North Korea they even went on
the claim that we'd made history now
that's a pretty bold statement but it is
in fact historic in the years since the
Korean War North Korean and American
athletes have competed against each
other on a handful of occasions but
they'd never played on the same team and
that sentiment of collaboration was
echoed by kim jong hoon
when he gave the final toast of
anonymous William Kazan and yo-yo Carson
idea to now Raymond areas karate a
Romantic period Iran and Iran have
nauseous
so you've got the average North Korean
people who are taught from birth that
America is this evil imperial power
hell-bent on their destruction waking up
the next day to see their Dear Leader
aka God hanging out with a bunch of
Americans saying he hopes that we can
all get along now of course it's
possible that's just more propaganda but
we did start to think that maybe just
maybe we may have had at least some
impact we realized that bringing a crew
of basketball players to North Korea
isn't going to lead to the country
dismantling its nuclear program shutting
down his labor camps or even toning down
its anti-american rhetoric but during
our time there we did accomplish
something we just stopped buses the
first time we've been able to do that
just found a cord on the side of the
street and we're actually able to stop
at it the Globetrotters they're gonna
see if they can get involved and it's
actually really awesome to see through
basketball we managed to bridge the
divide between our countries open a
dialog and make a connection with real
people
if only for a moment
do we like to try spin
everything else
amazing it was great it was amazing one
little kid just said welcome to all
country
ah cool mountains of ice are just
falling into the sea we're in for
trouble indeed this is where the Soviets
tested all their weapons this is the
epicenter of it include bomb the last
six months you have 9000 I easy that's
an IUD
once you get someone in they can never
leave even police helicopters don't dare
fly over here because two years ago one
was shot down by an anti-aircraft gun
fun place to live
okay let's get out of here
