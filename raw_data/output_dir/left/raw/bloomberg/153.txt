REPORT, A LITTLE PREVIEW THAT

105
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:52,792

00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,147
HARD OR EASY TO GET RIGHT NOW?

114
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:19,218
THE LOWER IT GOES THAT IS THE

115
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,019
MORE THEY THINK JOBS ARE EASIER

116
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,187
TO GET.

117
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,322
WE HAVE JUST THAT THE BEST LEVEL

118
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:26,859
SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS.

119
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:27,793

121
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:31,564
YOU CAN SEE HOW NICELY DIRECTION

122
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:32,265
HE TRACKS WITH THE U.S.

123
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,166
EMPLOYMENT RATE, SO WE WILL SEE

124
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,336
IF WE CONTINUE TO SEE A DECLINE

125
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:41,307
IN THE U.S. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AS

126
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,041

>> MY CHART STICKS WITH THE

130
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,318
MACRO SEEN, BUT LOOKING AT

131
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:55,822
CYCLICALS VERSUS DEFENSIVE.

132
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,623
I WANTED TO LOOK AT IT GLOBALLY.

133
00:05:57,623 --> 00:06:00,192
HERE I HAVE THE FTSE CYCLICAL

134
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:03,296
INDEX AND WHITE AND THE FTSE

135
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:07,533
DEFENSIVE INDEX.

136
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,835
CYCLICAL SHARES ARE

137
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:10,603
OUTPERFORMING DEFENSIVE FOR A

138
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,605
SECOND STRAIGHT MONTH.

139
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,941
GLOBAL ECONOMIC DATA HAS BEATEN

140
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,476
FORECASTS SINCE JULY, BUT STILL

141
00:06:17,476 --> 00:06:18,844
THE WORLD SHOWING THE SLOWEST

142
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:21,747
GROWTH RATE IN SEVEN YEARS, BUT

143
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:22,481
STILL SEEING THIS ROTATION

144
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:22,882
GLOBALLY.

145
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:27,720
THESE INDEX HAVE MEMBERS FROM

146
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,155
JAPAN, KOREA, SWITZERLAND.

147
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:29,922
IT IS REALLY LOOKING GLOBAL

148
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,091
HERE.

149
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:32,825
SINCE THE END OF JUNE, THE

150
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:37,830
CYCLICAL INDEX HAS JUMPED 9.5%,

151
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,366
WHERE AS THE DEFENSIVE ONE HAS

152
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,801
DROPPED TO 0.7%, SO THAT REALLY

153
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:42,769
TELLS THE STORY.

154
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:48,174
MATT: THESE GUYS ARE BEATING

155
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:48,908
THIS ROTATION THING TO DEATH.

156
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:56,115
JOE: OLIVER RENICK IS ONSET.

157
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,950
EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THIS

158
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,087
SHIFT.

159
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,157
THAT'S SO OLD NEWS.

160
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,427
WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING?

161
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,194
DO PEOPLE SEE THIS TREND IS

162
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:08,794
HAVING ROOM TO RUN?

163
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:11,631
OLIVER: PERHAPS.

164
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,100
IT DEPENDS ON WHY YOU THINK IT

165
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:20,772
IS HAPPENING TO BEGIN WITH.

166
00:07:20,772 --> 00:07:21,474
THIS ONE IS POTENTIALLY

167
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,241
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF

168
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,743
THE FEW AREAS OF THE MARKET THAT

169
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,880
HAS SURVIVED, WEAKER THE PAST

170
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,117
MONTH, BUT THROUGH THE FIRST SIX

171
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,487
MONTHS, IT WAS THE ONLY PART OF

172
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,321
THE STOCK MARKET GETTING HIGHER

173
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,956
LEVELS AND HIGHER VALUATIONS, SO

174
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:42,261
IF YOU THINK THIS IS A RESULT OF

175
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,062
SPECULATION INTEREST RATES WILL

176
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:43,829
MOVE HIGHER AND DIVIDEND PAYING

177
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:44,864
COMPANIES WILL NOT BE THE HOT

178
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:48,801
COMMODITY TO GO AFTER, THEN THAT

179
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,436
COULD BE ONE EXPLANATION, BUT IF

180
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:54,040
YOU LOOK AT THE BOND MARKETS, IT

181
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,274
IS VERY INTERESTING, 30 YEAR

182
00:07:55,274 --> 00:08:01,714
SWAPS, NOW BELOW TREASURIES, SO

183
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:02,581
YOU BASICALLY HAVE A MARKET THAT

184
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:05,317
INDICATES EXPECTATIONS OF LOWER

185
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:05,985
RATES IN THE LONGER TERM

186
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:06,519
DURATION BONDS.

187
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,087
IF THAT IS THE CASE, THAT MUST

188
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:11,858
NOT BE AN INTEREST RATE FEW ON

189
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:12,692
WHAT IS HAPPENING AND DIVIDEND

190
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:13,493
SOCKS.

191
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,395
EITHER THE MARKETS ARE WRONG, OR

192
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:19,465
THESE TYPES OF COMPANIES ARE

193
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,400
DOING LESS WELL BECAUSE OF SOME

194
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,437
OTHER REASON.

195
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,906
MAYBE IT IS A VALUATION STORY, A

196
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:27,606
SECTOR ROTATION, CORPORATE

197
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:29,475

199
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:41,986

200
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:42,722
LIKE THE DIVIDENDS THEY ARE

201
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:46,592
PAYING, BUT EARNINGS MISSED THE

202
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,628
STREETS EXPECTATIONS BY 30% LAST

204
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:55,300
CUT THOSE DIVIDENDS.

205
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,135
PAYOUTS FROM TELECOMS, STAPLES,

206
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,204
AND UTILITIES, ALL THESE

207
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,038
DEFENSIVE SECTORS, BUT IT THEY

208
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,539
DON'T EARN MONEY, THEY CAN'T

209
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:02,675
CONTINUE TO PAY YOU THIS UNLESS

210
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,210
THEY BORROW.

211
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:04,944
THAT COULD BE ONE OF THE

212
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:05,377
CONCERNS.

213
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:10,883
OLIVER: THIS COMES INTO A LARGER

214
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,618
PICTURE IN THE EQUITY MARKET,

215
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,454
WHICH IS HIGH PAYOUT RATIOS,

216
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:16,288
PROFITS WEAKENING, BUT DIVIDENDS

217
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:17,089
HAVE NOT BEEN CUT.

218
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:19,625
WE ARE SEEING SOME OF THAT IN

219
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,861
MORE DISTRESSED AREAS, BUT WHICH

220
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,196
SECTORS ARE THE ONES THAT WILL

221
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:24,964
HAVE TO CUT DIVIDENDS IF THEY

222
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,165
NEED TO.

223
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,533
THERE ARE DIFFERENT METRICS YOU

224
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,168
CAN LOOK AT SHOWING COMPANY

225
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,936
STRETCHED IN TERMS OF THEIR CASH

226
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:31,737
LEVELS AND MOVING DOWN THE PAST

00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,773
COUPLE OF QUARTERS, DEBT LEVELS

228
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,174
GETTING HIGH, THE FIRST THING TO

229
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,842
GO IS NOT THE DIVIDEND, BUT

230
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:40,880
THESE OTHER SHAREHOLDER

231
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,215
ACTIVITIES, BUYBACKS, ETC., THAT

232
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:43,949
HAVE STRETCH THE COMPANY THIN.

233
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:45,985
IF WE DON'T SEE THAT QUICK

234
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,187
TURNAROUND AND EARNINGS, WHICH

235
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:48,988
KEEPS GETTING PUSHED UP QUARTER

236
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,557
AND QUARTER, GUESS WHAT?

237
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:55,828
NOW IT'S NEGATIVE EARNINGS.

238
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,695
THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT, TO FOCUS

239
00:09:56,695 --> 00:09:58,063
ON WHETHER THEY CAN KEEP UP TO

240
00:09:58,063 --> 00:09:58,531
BEGIN WITH.

241
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:01,433

00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:03,369
MULTIPLES.

243
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,437
WE HAVE DO HAVE A CHART TO SHOW

244
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:07,206
THEM ELEVATED HISTORICALLY AND

245
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,943
ALMOST ACROSS ALL METRICS.

246
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:11,744
THEY REMAIN BELOW THE REST OF

247
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:12,378
THE DEVELOPED WORLD.

248
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:16,448
I HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE TELL ME

249
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:17,483
THAT EUROPE IS ATTRACTIVE VERSUS

250
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:20,653
THE U.S., JAPAN IS ATTRACTIVE,

251
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,320
BUT ARE USING SOMETHING

252
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:21,754
DIFFERENT?

253
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,557
OLIVER: THIS IS AN INTERESTING

254
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:27,793
THING, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE S&P,

255
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,661
NO MATTER WHAT METRIC, YOU WILL

256
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:35,835
FIND THE MARKET IS EITHER HIGHLY

257
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:36,635
VALUED RELATIVE TO HISTORY OR IN

258
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:41,073
ONE OF THE TOP PERCENTILES.

259
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,408
THEY WILL SHOW AN OVERVALUED

260
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,443
STOCK MARKET, BUT YOU HAVE TO

261
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:45,911
REMEMBER THERE IS A LOGICAL

262
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:46,679
EXPLANATION FOR WHY VALUATIONS

263
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,348
ARE HIGH.

264
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,149
THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS SORT OF

265
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,184
THE BEST HOUSE ON THE BLOCK.

266
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:52,885
THERE IS A MATHEMATICAL

267
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,587
CONSIDERATION YOU HAVE TO TAKE

268
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,120
INTO ACCOUNT.

269
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,657
IF YOU LOOK AT TE, THEY HAVE NOT

270
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:00,292
BEEN GREAT, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT

271
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,595
EUROPE, THEY HAVE GOTTEN

272
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:03,062
DEMOLISHED.

273
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,064
IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE WORLD,

274
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,298
THE DENOMINATOR KEEPS GETTING

275
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,032
LOWER AND LOWER AND THOSE

276
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:09,035
VALUATIONS ARE VERY HIGH.

277
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:14,106
THE FTSE IS TRADING 50 TIMES.

278
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:17,743
IF YOU LOOK AT MARKET RELATIVE

279
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:18,677
VIBRATION COME THE S&P TRADING

280
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:21,914
AT 20-22 TIMES, LOWER THAN ITS

281
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:24,817
PEERS IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD.

282
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,821
SO IT IS INTERESTING TO TRY TO

283
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:29,622
FIGURE OUT WHETHER VALUATIONS IN

284
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,391
THE U.S. ARE HIGH BASED ON OUR

285
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,193
OWN HISTORY, BUT AROUND THE

286
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:34,994
WORLD, THEY COULD BE ATTRACTIVE.

287
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:38,130
JOE: THIS CHART I HAVE BEEN

291
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:52,311
STOCKS ARE MOVING AND LOCKSTEP

292
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,480

00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,285

298
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,359

IT'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING,

301
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:11,563
SO YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHERE

302
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:12,998
YOU ARE GOING TO PUT IT HERE AND

303
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:16,568
IF YOU WANT TO GO INTO A RISKIER

304
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:17,303

MARKETS.

306
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:19,672
YOU WANT TO BE SOMEWHERE WHERE

307
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,974
YOU GET SOME KIND OF RETURN,

308
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:25,444
THEN GO TO THE U.S.

309
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,514
THAT PUSHES STOCKS UP, BOND

310
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,549
YIELDS DOWN, BUT WHETHER THE

311
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:31,317
CORRELATION CAN STAY IN TACT

312
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:31,884

00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:18,270
UP, BACK AROUND 13, A SUPPORT

377
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,440
LEVEL.

378
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,344
IT DID BELOW, AND NOW BACK UP.

379
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:29,314
AS YOU HEAD INTO SEASONALITY IN

380
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:34,052
SEPTEMBER, BREXIT, YOU HAVE A

381
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:39,558
CHANCE TO SEE VIX SPIKE UP, BOND

382
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:44,263
YIELDS CREEP UP GLOBALLY, AND

383
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,364
THESE BOND PROXY STOCKS,

384
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,999
UTILITIES, DIVIDEND STOCKS,

385
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:52,271
SMALL OUTFLOWS, UNDERPERFORMING,

386
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,872
AND SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

387
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:54,673
HAVE SUPPORTED THE EQUITY MARKET

388
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:55,140
ARE NOT THERE.

389
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,776
>> THAT IS LIKE THE THEME OF THE

390
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:58,477
WEEK FOR US HERE.

391
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:02,948
>> THE DEATH OF THE SAFETY

392
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:03,782
STOCKS.

393
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,484
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

394
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:08,654
IT COULDN'T IT BE THAT THE

395
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,589
ECONOMY IS IMPROVING AND THINKS

396
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,390
OF BETTER SO WE NO LONGER NEED

397
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:11,757
TO HIDE?

398
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:18,697
>> THERE IS SOME RELEVANT --

399
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:19,264
ELEMENT TO THAT.

400
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,399
YOU ARE SEEING A RUSH INTO BETA,

401
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,602
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE CHOSE THIS

402
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,336
AS THE LAST BASTION IN THE

403
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,938
EQUITY MARKET.

404
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:26,672
THEY DID NOT WANT TO OWN

405
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:28,774
EQUITIES, BUT NOT THE DIVIDEND

406
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,809
STOCKS.

407
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,978
AS YIELDS GO HIGHER AND THEY GET

408
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:33,812
NERVOUS, I THINK THEY WILL WANT

409
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:36,782
TO GO OUT OF THAT.

410
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,984
I THINK THE NEXT EXODUS IS OUT

411
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,854
OF THE STOCK MARKET COMPLETELY.

412
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:47,092
IF THEY GIVE UP THAT, THEY ARE

413
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:47,893
SELLING THE EQUITY MARKETS, AND

414
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:48,593
THAT WILL CREATE PRESSURE.

415
00:18:48,593 --> 00:18:51,964
>> WE TALKED ABOUT THIS HUNT FOR

416
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,533
YIELD, AND ONE THING YOU TALK

417
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,300
ABOUT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES

418
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,135
PRESENTED BY THE INCREASING

419
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,170
LIBOR.

420
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,074
A GREAT COLUMN ABOUT HOW THE FED

421
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,109
ACTUALLY HAS NOT PAID A LOT OF

422
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:04,876
ATTENTION TO THE PROSPECTS OF

423
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:07,045
THIS RISING, SO HOW ARE YOU

424
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:07,546
PLAYING THIS?

425
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:12,317
>> WE LIKE THE LEVERAGED LOAN

426
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,051
SPACE, THE HIGH-YIELD BOND

427
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,154
EQUIVALENT, SO FLOATING RATES.

428
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,557
YOU ARE STARTING TO CREEP ABOVE

429
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:22,627
75, AN INCREASE IN RATES,

430
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:23,862
STEPPING UP THE CAPITAL

431
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,197
STRUCTURE, SO I PREFERRED THAT

432
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:25,797
ELEMENT OF SAFETY.

433
00:19:25,797 --> 00:19:29,801
WITHIN THAT, THERE ARE CLOSE IN

434
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:33,872
THE FUNDS, ETF'S, SO YOU HAVE

435
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:39,177
SOME UPSIDE IF YIELDS DO RISE,

436
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:41,046
AND A LOT OF PROTECTION BECAUSE

437
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:44,516
THE LIBOR MOVE IS ISOLATED.

438
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,151
WERE ALSO LOOKING AT FLOATING

439
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,619
RATE IN BONDS, CITIBANK CAME OUT

440
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,353
WITH A SEVEN-YEAR FLOATER.

441
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,057
THERE ARE CORPORATE FLOATERS,

442
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:56,295
ETF FLT, SO YOU'RE NOT GIVING UP

443
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,430
MUCH TO AVOID INTEREST RATE

444
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:04,035
RISK.

445
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:04,870
THAT TRADE-OFF MAKES SENSE TO

446
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,203
ME.

447
00:20:05,203 --> 00:20:10,742
JOE: DOES THIS ADVANTAGE PEOPLE

448
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:11,743
LOOKING FOR DIVERSIFICATION AND

449
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:12,277
PORTFOLIOS.

450
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:15,814
I'M LOOKING AT THE DEGREE TO

451
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:16,815
WHICH EQUITIES AND TREASURIES

452
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:19,952
SEEM TO BE MOVING IN LOCKSTEP.

453
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:20,619
THERE SEEMS TO BE NO

454
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,853
DIVERSIFICATION.

455
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:22,754
FRIDAY WAS ONE OF THE WORST DAYS

456
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,290
IN A LONG TIME FOR THE

457
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:29,361
MULTI-STRATEGY INDICES THAT WAS

458
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,931
A STRONG VERY.

459
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:33,899
DOES THE STRATEGY YOU REPRESENT

460
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,566
OFFER ALTERNATIVES?

461
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:38,971
>> IT WILL BEHAVE MORE

462
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,672
UNCORRELATED. MOVING INTO LIBOR

463
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,841
AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS

464
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,643
RISE, WHICH IS TECHNICAL AND

465
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,478
WONKY, BUT WILL BE MAINSTREAM

466
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:50,715
AND HIT PEOPLE IF THEY SEE THEIR

467
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:51,616
MORTGAGES GO UP, SO IT'S A GREAT

468
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:53,852
WAY TO GET YIELD AND DIVERSIFY

469
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,854
AWAY FROM FIXED INCOME.

470
00:20:55,854 --> 00:21:00,025
MATT: WE ARE LOOKING FOR A GAIN

471
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,294
OF 180,000.

472
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:03,094
WE GOT A BLOWOUT NUMBER LAST

473
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:04,930
MONTH.

474
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,265
IF WE GET A BLOWOUT NUMBER THIS

475
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:07,966
MONTH, DOES THE FED GO IN

476
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:08,366
SEPTEMBER?

477
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:14,172
>> I THINK THERE IS A DECENT

478
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:14,940
CHANCE TO GO EVEN IF WE GET A

479
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,109
DECENT NUMBER.

480
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,377
THE AUGUST REPORT IS TYPICALLY

481
00:21:19,377 --> 00:21:20,912
DISAPPOINTING, SO IF WE, IN

482
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,214
LINE, THAT WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH.

483
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:25,550
WHERE I DIFFER IS THAT THE FED

484
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,419
SPENT SO MUCH TIME PUTTING JUNE

485
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,289
ON THE TABLE, THEN DIDN'T RAISE.

486
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,457
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IS COMING INTO

487
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,291
JUNE, WE HAD BAD DATA AFTER BAD

488
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,426
DATA.

489
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:39,498
IT WAS MORE THAN THAT.

490
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,398
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE THE

491
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:45,270
EXACT OFFICE -- OPPOSITE.

492
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,073
THERE ARE SIGNS OF INFLATION,

493
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,975
JOBS THERE, SO I WOULD NOT BE

494
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:50,742
SURPRISED TO SEE A SEPTEMBER

495
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:51,443
HIKE IF WE GET A GOOD JOBS

496
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:51,843
REPORT.

497
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,246
JOE: THAT WAS PETER CHEER.

498
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:59,618
MATT: COMING UP, THERE'S RETURN

499
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:00,185
TO THE MARKET.

500
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:05,524
WE HAVE THE CHART YOU CAN'T

501
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:05,991
MISS, NEXT.

502
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:06,525
THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

503
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:06,858
♪

504
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:35,474
MATT: "WHAT'D YOU MISS?"

505
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,309
WHY MATT MILLER.

506
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:41,346
THE YUAN BEARS HAVE RETURNED.

507
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:44,483
I FORGET MY CHART NUMBER.

508
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,551
3123, THANK YOU.

509
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:52,790
THAT IS WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR.

510
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,625
I HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT LOOKS

511
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:58,730
AT THE YUAN BEARS.

512
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,564
THIS ONE SHOWS YOU THE THREE

513
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:02,233
MONTH IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND THE

514
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:04,503
SPOT PRICE AND BLUE.

515
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,005
AS THE LINE GOES UP, THE YUAN

516
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,609
GETS WEAKER.

517
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,777
THREE MONTH VOLATILITY IN AUGUST

518
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:13,545
HAS CLIMBED AT A FASTER RATE

519
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,882
THAN ANY MONTH SINCE JANUARY.

520
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,717
BECAUSE OF THAT, YOU CAN SEE

521
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:22,420
TRADERS THINK THE YUAN COULD GET

522
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,723
WILDER.

523
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,958
YOU COULD LOOK AT THE FACT THAT

524
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:27,692
PUTS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

525
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,961
CALLS RIGHT NOW.

526
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:30,829
THE FORWARD CONTRACTS TRADED AT

527
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,364
A DISCOUNT TO THE SPOT PRICE.

528
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:35,567
ALL THESE THINGS INDICATE THAT

529
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,402
EVERYONE EXPECTS THE YUAN TO

530
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:37,802
WEAKEN.

531
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:42,874
JOE: THERE IS A VOLATILITY

532
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:43,241
PICKUP.

533
00:25:43,241 --> 00:25:46,811
THE S&P 500 OR MARKETS DON'T

534
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:49,381
RESPOND TO THE WEAKENING

535
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,181
CURRENCY, BUT DO RESPOND TO A

536
00:25:50,181 --> 00:26:00,124
SPIKE IN VOLATILITY.

537
00:26:00,124 --> 00:26:02,027
SPEAKING OF THE CHINA STORY, I

538
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,929
WANT TO LOOK AT MY FAVORITE DATA

539
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:05,697
POINT, WHICH COMES OUT LATER

540
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:06,397
THIS WEEK, MACCALLUM GAMING

541
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:07,999
REVENUE.

542
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:14,105
-- MACAU GAMING REVENUE.

543
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,474
YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE, ONLY DOWN

544
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:21,446
BY 7.1%, COMPARED TO WHERE WE

545
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:23,181
WERE, WE ARE ONE POINT DOWN ON

546
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:31,122
GDP, 23% DOWN GDP LAST YEAR, SO

547
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,692
THIS IS QUITE A COMEBACK.

548
00:26:33,692 --> 00:26:34,459
THE BLUE BAR CHART IS GAMING

549
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:35,727
REVENUE.

550
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,528
WE WILL GET THAT LATER THIS

551
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,596
WEEK.

552
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:41,566
THAT HAS ALSO BEEN IMPROVING.

553
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,434
ANIMAL SPIRITS AND THE HEALTH OF

554
00:26:43,434 --> 00:26:45,904
THE EMERGING MARKETS, YOU CAN

555
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:46,738
SEE HOW THAT TRACKS THE GENERAL

556
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,473
SHAPE OF EMERGING MARKETS, SO

557
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:49,174
DEEP AND I ON THOSE GAMING

558
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,508
REVENUE NUMBERS.

559
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:54,712
-- AN EYE ON THOSE GAMING

560
00:26:54,712 --> 00:26:55,246
REVENUE NUMBERS.

561
00:26:55,246 --> 00:27:02,320

00:36:41,933 --> 00:36:43,901
THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO

750
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,938
GO IN INCREMENTAL STEPS.

751
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:47,805
THERE ARE TWO BILLS THAT NEED TO

752
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:52,743
BE SUBMITTED TO CONGRESS, AN

753
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:53,544
AMENDMENT TO CAP THE GROWTH OF

754
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,781
PRIMARY SPENDING.

755
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,849
THE HOPE IS THAT WILL CLEAR

756
00:36:58,849 --> 00:36:59,583
CONGRESS WITH NOT TOO MANY

757
00:36:59,583 --> 00:37:03,054
LOOPHOLES.

758
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:03,821
THE SECOND ONE IS A STRONG

759
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:05,756
SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM THAT

760
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:10,027
IMPROVES THE CHURCH A TREE FOR

761
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:10,828
THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM.

762
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:16,000
MORE THAN THAT, WE NEED THE

763
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,834
GOVERNMENT TO STOP ACCOMMODATING

764
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:17,668
DEMANDS FOR ADDITIONAL SPENDING

765
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:18,302

766
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:23,040
JOE: IF YOU LOOK IN THE

772
00:37:32,716 --> 00:37:37,621
EXTREMELY HIGH.

773
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:38,489
THE YEARS HAVE NOT BEEN KIND TO

00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,092

780
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,506
IT'S A CRUDE WAY OF SHOWING HOW

781
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:56,207
PAINFUL THE SITUATION IS.

782
00:37:56,207 --> 00:38:01,011

RELATED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS.

785
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:07,318
YOU END UP WITH INFLATION AND

786
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:11,589
DOUBLE DIGITS IN 2015.

787
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:12,423
THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATION THAT

788
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,259
EXPANDED WAY TOO MUCH.

789
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:18,195
THE FEAR THAT ON THIS PATH WE

790
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:23,167
WILL GO INTO FISCAL

791
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:27,371

808
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,623
SENSITIVE AND UNPOPULAR, BUT
