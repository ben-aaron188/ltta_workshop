WHAT JUMPS OUT AT YOU?

193
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:10,216

194
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,250

195
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,220
FIRM, A LITTLE SELLOFF TODAY,

196
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,290
BUT WHILE WE HAVE BEEN STUCK IN

197
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,393
THIS FLAT NARROW TRADING RANGE,

198
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,294
THERE HAS REALLY BEEN A ROTATION

199
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:23,963
GOING ON OVER THE PAST MONTH

200
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:30,436

201
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,438
TECHNOLOGY, FINANCIALS,

202
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,205

CONSUMER STAPLES, HIGH DIVIDEND

205
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,445
STOCKS, SO IT BEGS THE QUESTION.

206
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,580
IS THIS A ROTATION FROM ONE

207
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:50,756
LEADERSHIP TO ANOTHER?

208
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,092
THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE ALL

209
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:53,859

00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,561

211
00:09:55,561 --> 00:10:01,400
MATT: SINCE 1958, S&P 500

212
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,437
DIVIDEND YIELD IS THE HIGHEST IT

213
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:06,405
HAS BEEN RELATIVE TO THE 10 YEAR

214
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:09,708
YIELD SINCE 1958, THAT WAS

215
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:14,012
BEFORE ANY OF US WERE BORN.

216
00:10:14,012 --> 00:10:17,783

218

219
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:31,630

220
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,766

221
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:38,037
I HAVE BEEN A PESSIMIST.

222
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:38,804
I FELT THESE HIGH VALUATIONS

223
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,040
WOULD MAKE IT TOUGH FOR THE

224
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,774
MARKET TO KEEP RALLYING FROM

225
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,143
HERE.

226
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:44,977
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT YOU

227
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,646
CAN LOOK AT AND SAY THE ECONOMY

228
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,715
IS IMPROVING.

229
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,084
ONE OF THE THINGS IS THE ATLANTA

230
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:52,651
FED GDP FORECAST.

231
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:54,687
SCARLET: IT SHOT UP RECENTLY.

232
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:59,859
>> YEAH, 3.6% NOW.

233
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:04,964
GROWTH IN THE SECOND QUARTER WAS

234
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:05,731
HAMSTRUNG A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE

235
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,434
OF INVENTORIES.

236
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,268
SO MAYBE THIS IS A BOUNCE BACK

237
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:12,972
FROM THAT.

238
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,608
IT IS SURPRISING TO SEE THAT

239
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:16,408
STRONG GROWTH FORECAST FROM THE

240
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:16,842
ATLANTA FED.

241
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:21,213

242
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:21,981
ATLANTA GDP FED AS A PREDICTOR

243
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:22,448

244
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:25,150
>> THE CONSENSUS WE TRACK IS

245
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,921
LESS THAN HALF OF THAT, SO WE

246
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:29,722
WILL HAVE TO SEE WHO IS RIGHT,

247
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:30,756
BUT THE LATEST REPORTS BEING

248
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:35,094

249
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:35,828

250
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:40,666
MATT: SINCE IT IS PART OF THE

251
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,500
FEDERAL RESERVE BANK SYSTEM, DO

252
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,368

253
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:46,538
SCARLET: DO THEY HAVE TO ATTACH

00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:47,172
MORE WEIGHT TO IT?

255
00:11:47,172 --> 00:11:51,710

256
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,013
AS IT COMES IN RATHER THAN A

257
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,981

IT HAS SHOWN A MORE PLASTIC VIEW

260
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,022

00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:03,756

262
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:08,427
SCARLET: THIS IS MORE AN

263
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,462
INDICATOR OF THE OVERALL ECONOMY

264
00:12:10,462 --> 00:12:11,330
BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT JOB

265
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:11,830

266
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,264

267
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:15,401
THIS REPORT YESTERDAY IS

268
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,469

270

271
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,581
TO ME IT IS A REASON TO BE VERY

272
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:32,051
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE ECONOMY,

273
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,919
NOT JUST HOMEBUILDERS, BUT THE

274
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,820

275
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,689
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HOME

276
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:41,861

THEY HAVE PRODUCED ONLY MORE

00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,696
MORE JOBLESSNESS, AND BROKEN

617
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:32,377
THERE IS A LACK OF OF AFFORDABLE

618
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:33,144
HOUSING IN PALO ALTO DRIVING

619
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:33,811
RESIDENTS AWAY.

FRANCISCO BAY AREA COMMUNITY HAS

622
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,051
THE WORST HOUSING POLICY IN THE

623
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:48,425
U.S. 

624
00:33:48,425 --> 00:33:49,193
THANK YOU FOR JOINING AS.

625
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,029
YOU RECENTLY RESIGNED AND

626
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:56,467
DECIDED TO LEAVE PALO ALTO

627
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,301
BECAUSE OF YOUR $6,200 A MONTH

628
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,169
SHARED RENT.

629
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:02,273
WHY IS THE CITY UNWILLING TO

630
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:02,840
ADDRESS THE ISSUE?

631
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,745
>> OUR PROBLEM WITH HOUSING IS

632
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,179
THAT WE HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY

633
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,414
ADDED FAR MORE JOBS THAN HOUSING

634
00:34:10,414 --> 00:34:11,581
FOR DECADES.

635
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:12,449
WE HAVE THE LARGEST IMBALANCE IN

636
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:17,855
THE NATION WITH THREE JOBS FOR

637
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:18,656
EVERY HOUSING UNIT IN PALO ALTO.

638
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:22,760
BECAUSE OF THE IMBALANCE AND

639
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,594
REGIONAL SHORTAGE IN THE AREA,

640
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,563
HOUSING PRICES SPIRALING OUT OF

641
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:25,996
CONTROL.

642
00:34:25,996 --> 00:34:28,232
SCARLET: WHAT I FOUND

643
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,402
FASCINATING IS THE PALO ALTO

644
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,036
MAYOR'S COMMENTS.

645
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,371
WE ARE LOOKING TO INCREASE THEIR

646
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:36,340
RATE OF HOUSING GROWTH, BUT

647
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,708
DECREASE THE RATE OF JOB GROWTH.

648
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:40,244
THIS DOES NOT MEAN WE WANT NO

649
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:45,750
JOB GROWTH.

650
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,516
WE WANT ME TO JOB GROWTH AND

651
00:34:46,516 --> 00:34:47,652
METERED HOUSING GROWTH.

652
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:54,257
JOE: IS THAT A REASONABLE POINT,

653
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:56,860
THAT EVEN IF YOU WERE TO ADD

654
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,628
MORE HOUSING IN PALO ALTO THAT

655
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:59,630
IT WOULD CREATE A HUGE'S STRESS

656
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:03,668
ON THAT TRANSPORTATION

657
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:04,969
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE PROBLEM

658
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:05,770
WOULD SHOW UP A DIFFERENT WAY?

659
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,773
>> YOU NEED TO DO BOTH, AT

660
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,741
HOUSING AND INVEST IN PUBLIC

661
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:11,309
TRANSPORTATION.

662
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:16,681
MATT: IT IS ODD TO HEAR A MAYOR

663
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:17,515
SUGGESTED THAT HE WANTS TO LIMIT

664
00:35:17,515 --> 00:35:19,117
JOB GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY HE

665
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,919
RUNS.

666
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:26,090
I DON'T THINK I HAVE EVER HEARD

667
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:26,891
ANY OTHER POLITICIANS SAY THEY

668
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:30,128
WANT TO HOLD JOB GROWTH BACK.

669
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,962
ON THE OTHER HAND, I CAN

670
00:35:31,962 --> 00:35:33,497
UNDERSTAND WHY HE WOULD NOT WANT

671
00:35:33,497 --> 00:35:34,098
TO PUT STRESS ON THE

672
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:35,299
INFRASTRUCTURE.

673
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,903
IS TRAFFIC VERY HEAVY?

674
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:39,670
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO GET

675
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,371
AROUND IF YOU ADDED MORE

676
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:40,738
HOUSING?

677
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:44,775
>> I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE, BUT

678
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,577
IT TAKES SMART PLANNING AND A

679
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:49,480
DESIRE TO MAKE THOSE PLANS.

680
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,381
LOOK AT WHO IS ON OUR CITY

681
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:54,218
COUNCIL.

682
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:56,787
THEY ARE EITHER INDEPENDENTLY

683
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:57,588
WEALTHY AND DON'T NEED TO WORK

684
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:58,289
OR RETIRED.

685
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,024
YOU HAVE A MAYOR WHO BOUGHT A

686
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:03,094
HOUSE FOR LESS THAN $500,000,

687
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:04,128
BUT NOW IT'S WORTH MORE THAN $4

688
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:05,296
MILLION.

689
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,698
THEY DON'T NEED JOBS ANYMORE.

690
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:08,332
THEY ARE RICH ENOUGH.

691
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,568
JOE: THIS IS THE POINT I WANTED

692
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,404
TO ASK YOU ABOUT.

693
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:16,974
FROM YOUR TIME ON THE PLANNING

694
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:17,675
COMMISSION, WHAT IS THEIR

695
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,376
MOTIVATION FOR THE LACK OF

696
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,610
HOUSING?

697
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,780
IS IT JUST PERSONAL AND TRYSTS,

698
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,547
THAT THEIR REAL ESTATE VALUES

699
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:24,649
HAVE SURGE?

700
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,151
OR IS THERE TALK ABOUT

701
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:27,952
PRESERVING THE STATE OF THE

702
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,553
COMMUNITY AND NOT CHANGING MUCH,

703
00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:32,290
DOES THAT HOLD WATER?

704
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,090
WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ABOUT THEIR

705
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:33,758
REAL MOTIVATION HERE?

706
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:36,827
>> I THINK THE FIRST ONE IS AS

707
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:42,333
YOU HAVE OUT LINE, THE HOUSING

708
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,167
SHORTAGE PROPS UP PEOPLE'S

709
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:43,667
HOUSING PRICES.

710
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:45,903
YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT

711
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:48,973
HOUSES FOR $100,000 AND THEY'RE

712
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:53,144
NOW WORTH MORE THAN $3 MILLION

713
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,245
OR $4 MILLION.

714
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:58,416
THEY DID NOT EARN THAT MONEY.

715
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,250
THEY BOUGHT INTO THAT MARKET AND

716
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,152
ENACTED THE POLICIES TO KEEP

717
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:04,722
THOSE PRICES HIGH.

718
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,489
WHETHER OR NOT WE COULD DO

719
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:10,060
SOMETHING ABOUT IT, DEFINITELY.

720
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,895
MOST OF PALO ALTO IS ONE STORY

721
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,530
OR TWO-STORY STRUCTURES.

722
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,431
WE HAVE PARKING LOTS, STRIP

723
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:17,735
MALLS.

724
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:18,569
THERE ARE PLACES TO GROW AND GO

725
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,805
NEAR EXISTING PUBLIC TRANSIT

726
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,307
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO GROW IN A

727
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:24,074
WAY THAT WOULD HAVE THE LEAST

728
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:25,876
HARMFUL IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITY,

729
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:28,512
BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE DOING IT

730
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:29,213
BECAUSE IT IS PROPPING UP

731
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:32,750
HOUSING PRICES, AND NUMBER TWO,

732
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,551
THEY WANT TO KEEP LIVING IN THE

733
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:33,918
SUBURB.

734
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,585
GO AHEAD.

735
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:42,393
MATT: IS IT OK FOR A COMMUNITY

736
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:43,260
TO COLLECTIVELY SAY WE DON'T

737
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,362
WANT TO GET ANY BIGGER, WE DON'T

738
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:47,331
WANT TO INCREASE OUR POPULATION,

739
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:48,632
WE DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A MORE

740
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:49,099
DENSE AREA?

741
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:53,037
>> I THINK IT IS FAIR FOR A

742
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:53,771
COMMUNITY THAT IS NOT A JOB

743
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,740
CENTER.

744
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,042
I DON'T THINK IT IS FAIR FOR A

745
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:02,480
COMMUNITY THAT HAS PURPOSELY

746
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,115
INVITED LOTS OF FORTUNE 500

747
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:04,782
COMPANIES TO ESTABLISH

748
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,016
HEADQUARTERS IN THEIR CITY AND

749
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:06,851
THEN TO SAY WE WILL TAKE THE TAX

750
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:10,087
REVENUE, BUT WOULD NOT DO

751
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:10,921
ANYTHING TO HOUSE YOUR WORKERS.

752
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:15,026
JOE: HERE IS SOME PUSHBACK.

753
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:20,931
SCARLET: A BLOOMBERG CONTRIBUTOR

754
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:25,135
WRITES "MOST CITIES DON'T HAVE A

755
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:26,270
SHORTAGE OF HOUSING, JUST IN

756
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,071
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE

757
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:29,073
WANT TO LIVE.

758
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:34,178
POLICY THAT CAN CONSTRAIN

759
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:34,845
DEVELOPMENT AND THE MORE

760
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,180
DEVELOPED PARTS OF CITIES CAN

761
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:36,981
FACILITATE DEVELOPMENT IN LESS

762
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:42,486
DEVELOPED NEIGHBORHOODS."

763
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:48,392
JOE: IS IT POSSIBLE THAT PALO

764
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,961
ALTO'S REFUSAL TO BUILD MORE

765
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,396
HOUSING IS A DE FACTO SUBSIDY TO

766
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:53,230
HELP OTHER AREAS GROW THAT NEED

767
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:53,931
THAT KIND OF GROWTH AND

768
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:54,832
POPULATION INFLOW?

769
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:59,336
>> I WOULD NOT SEE IT AS A

770
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:00,504
SUBSIDY.

771
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,674
I WOULD SEE IT AS A COST.

772
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:04,441
WE ARE A TECH OF IN SILICON

773
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:06,243
VALLEY.

774
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:12,316
-- TECH HUB IN SILICON VALLEY.

775
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:16,053
IT MAKES SINCE TO LOCATE NEXT TO

776
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:16,654
A RESEARCH UNIVERSITY,

777
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,389
INVESTORS.

778
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,491
WHEN PEOPLE ARE PUSHED INTO

779
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:22,393
AREAS THAT ARE NOT HUBS IN THAT

780
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:24,595
WAY, IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE FOR

781
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:28,132
COMPANIES TO SET UP SHOP, GROW,

782
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:30,301
FIND INVESTORS, FIND EMPLOYEES,

783
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:33,571
SO WHEN YOU PUSH OUT PEOPLE AND

784
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,773
CONSEQUENCES PUSH COMPANIES AWAY

785
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:36,540
FROM THAT ECOSYSTEM THAT MAKES

786
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,977
THEM THRIVE, EVERY ONE OF THOSE

787
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:40,778
COMPANIES IS THAT MUCH HARDER TO

788
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:41,612
START.

789
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:45,215
THAT MEANS IT'S HARDER TO START

790
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:46,050
NEW COMPANIES AND HARDER TO ADD

791
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:46,483
MORE JOBS.

792
00:39:46,483 --> 00:39:50,755
JOE: DO YOU HAVE ANY OPTIMISM

793
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,456
THAT ANYWHERE IN THE BAY AREA

794
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:54,692
THAT THINGS ARE GOING TO IMPROVE

795
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:55,726
OR IS YOUR VIEW THAT THIS FIGHT

796
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,861
WILL GO ON FOREVER WITHOUT ANY

797
00:39:57,861 --> 00:39:58,462
MEANINGFUL CHANGE?

798
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:02,633
>> THE ONLY MEANINGFUL CHANGE WE

799
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,001
CAN HOPE FOR IS THAT THE STATE

800
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,237
AND FEDERAL LEVEL.

801
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,071
EVERY CITY WILL CONTINUE TO ADD

802
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:10,574
MORE JOBS BECAUSE IT TAXES --

803
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:11,842
INCREASES TAX REVENUE.

804
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:15,879
JOE: THANK YOU.

805
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:16,413

THE STORY DONALD TRUMP IS

876
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:42,539

TO SAY THAT SHE MET WITH CLOSE

885
00:45:57,521 --> 00:46:00,657
TO 2000 FOLKS CONNECTED WITH

886
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:04,594
VARIOUS FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, AND

887
00:46:04,594 --> 00:46:05,362
THOSE NUMBERS WERE NOT COUNTED

888
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:09,333
AS PART OF THE REPORT.

889
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,100
OTHERS DEFENDING THE CLINTON

890
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:10,968
FOUNDATION SAYING THE FOUNDATION

891
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:14,772
HAS THOUSANDS OF DONORS AND ONLY

892
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,907
SEVERAL DOZEN OF THEM GOT

893
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:17,708
MEETINGS WITH HER WHEN SHE WAS

894
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:18,275
SECRETARY OF STATE.

895
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:22,879
THEY ARE PUSHING BACK, BUT A LOT

896
00:46:22,879 --> 00:46:23,781
OF HER PROBLEMS WITH TRUSTING

897
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,750
CREDIBILITY ARE BAKED IN THE

898
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:30,153
CAKE, AND WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS

899
00:46:30,153 --> 00:46:30,954
HOPING TO DO IS TAKE ADVANTAGE

900
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,924
OF THAT AND LET VOTERS GET LOST

901
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,793
IN THE DETAILS.

902
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:39,363
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE DETAILS,

903
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:40,263
BUT HERE'S ANOTHER REASON NOT TO

904
00:46:40,263 --> 00:46:40,664
TRUST HER.

905
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:45,335
JOE: I WANTED TO  ASK

906
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:46,170
EXACTLY ABOUT THAT.

907
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,106
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DETAILS, IS

908
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:50,507
THERE ANYTHING THAT SHE DID THAT

909
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:51,174
LOOKS LIKE PAY TO PLAY?

910
00:46:51,174 --> 00:46:58,915
>> THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF

911
00:46:58,915 --> 00:46:59,549
E-MAILS THAT THE STATE

912
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:00,283
DEPARTMENT IS GOING OVER AND

913
00:47:00,283 --> 00:47:01,051
WILL BE RELEASED BETWEEN NOW AND

914
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:04,821
NOVEMBER, BUT THE RECENT BATCH

915
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:11,395
SHOWS THE APPEARANCE OF ACCESS.

916
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:12,129
IF YOU ARE ACTIVE WITH THE

917
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:14,564
CLINTON FOUNDATION, THEN THERE

918
00:47:14,564 --> 00:47:17,100
WERE TOP-LEVEL CLINTON AIDES

919
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,702
TALKING TO EACH OTHER SAYING

920
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:19,503
MAYBE THIS PERSON WOULD LIKE TO

921
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,871
MEET WITH HER.

922
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:21,705
BUT DID THAT ACCESS TRANSLATE

923
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:26,743
INTO FAVORS OVER IS THAT THE OLD

924
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:29,646
WASHINGTON STAND BY, TO HAVE AN

925
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:31,715
EAR TO GET THEIR FOOT IN THE

926
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:34,418
DOOR, NOT THAT EITHER ONE OF

927
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:34,951
THEM IS GREAT.

928
00:47:34,951 --> 00:47:40,590
MATT: AT THIS POINT, IT IS AN

929
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:41,158
IMPORTANT POINT.

930
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:43,794
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

931
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:50,167
ACCESS AND ACTUAL FAVORS, WHICH

932
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:50,934
WOULD BE THE ETHICAL PROBLEM.

933
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:57,374
THERE IS NOT AN ETHICAL PROBLEM

934
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,041
WITH GETTING TO MEET THE

935
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:58,809

939

941

942

THE HEAT IS OFF OF HIM AS LONG

943
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:28,671

944

950
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:45,455
SHOULD WE EXPECT AN ENDORSEMENT?

951
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:50,961
>> EXPECTATION IS HE WILL STOP

952
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,163
SHORT OF AN ENDORSEMENT.

953
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:56,032
HE TOLD THE LOCAL STATION IN

954
00:48:56,032 --> 00:48:56,967
MISSISSIPPI THAT YOU COULD NOT

955
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:59,369
PAY HIM TO VOTE FOR HILLARY

956
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:02,639
CLINTON, WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE

957
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:03,340
HE SHOULD PROBABLY NOT BE

958

959
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:10,881
