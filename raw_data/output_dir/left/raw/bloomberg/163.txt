OF THAT MARKET CAP EXPANSION.

126
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,391
THIS SHOWS THE DIVERSIONS THAT

HAS SHOWN.

128
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:28,668
VALUATIONS ARE HIGH BUT PART OF

129
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,102
THE SOBRIETY OF THIS RALLY HAS

130
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:30,837
BEEN THE FACT THAT THERE ARE

131
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,539
STILL PRETTY LOW VALUATIONS AND

132
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,307
SOME OF THESE BIG COMPANIES.

133
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,208
THE YOU LOOK AT MICROSOFT,

134
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,876

00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:44,350
THREE.

139
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,051
THERE IS NOT QUITE THE SAME

140
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:45,485
EXUBERANCE.

141
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,887
MAYBE THAT IS WHY INVESTORS ARE

142
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,589

IN ONE SIMPLE CHART.

148
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:10,843
YOU CAN SEE WHAT WAS GOING BACK

149
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:11,377
IN 2000, 1999.

150
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,579
THE TOP PANEL HERE IS THE TECH

THE SPREAD IS AT THE BOTTOM.

157
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:28,528
LOOK AT HOW HIGH TECH STOCKS --

158
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,228
WERE VALUED.

159
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,029
NOT EVEN COME TO WHAT WE HAD

160
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:30,396
TODAY.

161
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:35,735
YOU HAVE 20 TO 21 PE IN THE TECH

162
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:39,772
AS WELL AS THE S&P.

163
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:40,439
THINGS ARE BLOWN OUT OF

164
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:40,873
PROPORTION.

165
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:41,607
IT ACCURATE TO THOUSAND, YOU

HAVE TECH STOCKS TRADING 80

167
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,676
TIMES 12 MONTH EARNINGS AND IT

168
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,912
WAS BUILDING, HARD TO KNOW WHEN

00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,981
YOU HIT THAT TOP THAT WE WILL --

170
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:52,718
YOU'VE SEE THAT FLAT LINE,

171
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:53,819
BASICALLY THE SAME AND I HAVE

172
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:58,090
ONE MUST CHART THAT IS SHOWING

173
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:58,691
THE SAME PRINCIPLE.

174
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,392
THIS IS LOOKING AT THOSE

175
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,192
EARNINGS SO BOILING IT DOWN A

176
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:01,928
LITTLE MORE ACUTELY WHEN YOU

177
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,829
LOOK AT PROFITS.

178
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:06,832
THIS SPEAKS TO THE IDEA THAT

179
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:07,633
RINGS ARE PRETTY HIGHLY VALUED

180
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,969
IN SOME AREAS OF TECH MARKET BUT

181
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:10,736
NOTHING INCREDIBLE ESPECIALLY

182
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:14,607
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHETHER OR

183
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:15,341
NOT EARNINGS CAN PROVIDE A

184
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:15,741
BACKSTOP.

185
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:16,509
THE BLUE LINE ASSURING YOU THAT

LAST YEAR.

189
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,883
WE HAVE NOT GONE ANYWHERE BUT

190
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:28,387
TECH IS STILL UP, UP 25% SINCE

00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:33,259
THAT EARNINGS BACKDROP GIVES

193
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,427
PEOPLE ENCOURAGEMENT AND WHETHER

194
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:38,831
THINGS ARE BLOWN OUT OF

195
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:39,298
PROPORTION.

196
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:45,204
RENY: THE NASDAQ AND THE S&P

197
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:48,341
TECH SECTOR HAVE BEEN UP 23%.

198
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,810
SOME AMAZING NUMBERS THERE.

199
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,477
TURNING OUT TO ASIA.

200
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,478
ALIBABA HAS BEEN ADDING SOCIAL

201
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,547
FEATURES TO ITS MOBILE APP TO

202
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,249
ATTRACT YOUNGER CUSTOMERS AND

203
00:06:57,249 --> 00:07:00,219
GET THEM TO STAND THE APP LONGER

204
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,054
AND ENTICE THEM TO SPEND MORE

205
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:02,421
MONEY.

206
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:03,222
THAT STRATEGY MAY BE PAYING OFF.

207
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:07,760
ACTIVE NUMBERS JUMPED AND MOBILE

208
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,962
REVENUE IS UP TO TWO AND $6

209
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:10,730
BILLION IN THE JUNE QUARTER.

210
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,497
PEOPLE ARE VISITING THE APP MORE

211
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,499
THAN SEVEN TIMES A DAY SPENDING

212
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,769
OVER 25 MINUTES IN TOTAL.

213
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,372
COMPARE THAT TO NINE MINUTES ON

214
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,607
AMAZON'S MOBILE APP OR 16

215
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:25,011
MINUTES ON TWITTER.

216
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,113
SOME INTERESTING STUFF HERE.

217
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,015
HOW WERE THEY ABLE TO DO THIS?

218
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:32,084
CELINE: THEY STARTED WITH A

219
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:36,989
SIMPLE APP BUT IT HAS EVOLVED

220
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:37,757
INTO SOMETHING MUCH DIFFERENT

221
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,125
FROM WHAT WE THINK OF AS TYPICAL

222
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,993
AS E-COMMERCE.

223
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:44,030
AMAZON'S STATS ARE MUCH LOWER.

224
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,834
THEY HAVE THIS VERY YOUNG BASE

225
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:49,902
OF USERS AND TO HOOK THEM AND

226
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,203
THEY NEED TO ADD ALL THE SOCIAL

227
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:51,637
FEATURES.

228
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:55,675
A CONJOINT ONE OF OVER 1000

229
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,542
SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, YOU CAN

230
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:57,243

234
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:05,284
THAT IS WHAT KEEPS THEM COMING

235
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:10,656
BACK FOR MORE.

236
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,524
RENY: IT SEEMS LIKE THE NUMBERS

237
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,459
ARE NOT PLAYING OUT ON THAT JUST

238
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,227
YET.

239
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:16,496
DEFINITELY AN ENVY.

240
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,464
WHAT IS THE DISCONNECT IN TERMS

241
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,601
OF THE COMPANIES?

242
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,736
CELINE: FACEBOOK HAS TRIED TO

243
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,570
GET PEOPLE TO SHOP AND INSIGHT,

244
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,441
THEY HAVE ADDED THE BUY BUTTON.

245
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:32,144
SAME THING WITH TWITTER AND

246
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:32,945
INTEREST AND AMAZON HAS NOT MADE

247
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:34,647
ANY MAJOR INROADS INTO SOCIAL

248
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,114
NETWORK.

249
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:39,351
THERE IS A HOST OF REASONS WHY

250
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,152
THERE ARE THESE DIFFERENCES BUT

251
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:40,919
THE MAIN ONE IS CHINA HAS HIS

252
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,222
ENORMOUS BASE THAT IS GROWING

253
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:48,394
AND THEY ARE USED TO THE

254
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,195
EXTREMELY CRAMPED INTERFACES.

255
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,430
TO A TYPICAL WESTERN SMARTPHONE

256
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:57,837
USER IT WOULD BE OVERWHELMING.

257
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:58,671
SO BECAUSE OF THAT THE CHINESE

258
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:02,475
ECOSYSTEM THESE COMPANIES HAVE

259
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,209
AN ABLE TO PUT EVERYTHING

260
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,311
ALTOGETHER, YOU CAN LOOK AT

261
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,847
REACH OUT, SOCIAL MESSAGE, BOOK

262
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:08,481
A TAXI, GET A HAIRCUT.

263
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:13,052
THAT IS WHY IT HAS BEEN HARD TO

264
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:13,853
CHANGE THE HABITS OF THE U.S.

265
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,888
CONSUMER?

266
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:21,026
>> IF THEY WANT TO PUT

267
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:21,794
EVERYTHING UP AGAINST THE WALL

268
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,996
TO SEE WHAT STICKS IT IS HELPING

269
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:24,363
THERE.

270
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,831
I DO WANT TO BRING UP A QUOTE

271
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:32,104
THAT YOU HAD FROM THE COFOUNDER

272
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:32,872
OF ALIBABA TALKING ABOUT HIS

273
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:33,539
COMPARISON WITH FACEBOOK.

274
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,240
HE SAID ON FACEBOOK YOU ARE

275
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,911
FRIENDING YOUR FRIENDS BUT THEY

276
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,446
START WITH STRANGERS AND USE

277
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:41,247
DATA TO FIND A COMMONALITY OF

278
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,215
INTEREST AND CREATE A COMMUNITY.

279
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,284
DO YOU THINK IN THE WEST THAT

280
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:50,423
THAT COULD MAKE TRACTION?

281
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,391
CELINE: HE IS SAYING THE

282
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:57,663
E-COMMERCE SITE HAS ALL THESE

283
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:58,164
DATA POINTS.

284
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:58,931
THEY ARE ABLE TO GROUP PEOPLE

285
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,366
INTO WHAT YOU BUY, WHAT YOU

286
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:00,866
LIKE, CREEPY.

287
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,135
THAT IS WHY THERE ARE THESE

288
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,969
FORCING SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS

289
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:07,606
FROM FISHING OR WEDDING PLANNING

290
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:08,174
OR BABY PLANNING.

291
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,543
IN THE U.S. AMAZON, THEY HAVE

292
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,546
NOT REALLY TRY TO DO THIS.

293
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,346
THEY SAID THEY WOULD HAVE TO

294
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:16,082
CHANGE HABITS.

295
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:16,916
I AM USED TO GOING TO FACEBOOK

296
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,584
TO TALKING TO MY FRIENDS AND

297
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,419
GOING TO AMAZON TO WHY THINGS

298
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,855
AND GOING TO TWITTER TO LOOK AT

299
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:23,422
NEWS AND TWEETS.

300
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,658
IT IS HARD TO CHANGE HABITS AND

301
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:29,829
IT WILL TAKE MORE YEARS TO BE

302
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,965
COMFORTABLE SOCIAL NETWORKING

303
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,935
AND ON OTHER TYPES OF APPS.

304
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,971
>> WE DO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE

305
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,573
INVESTED IN SNAPCHAT.

306
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,007
HE DOES NOT WANT FOLKS TO KNOW

307
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:42,341
THAT.

308
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:45,010
THERE IS ANOTHER ROAD HERE.

309
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:45,845
HE SAYS WE DO WANT TO LEARN AND

310
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:49,815
UNDERSTAND HOW SNAPCHAT IS

311
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,516
ENGAGING WITH YOUNG USERS.

312
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:51,317
WE ARE INTRIGUED BY THE PRODUCT

313
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,086

316
00:10:55,888 --> 00:11:00,059
WHY DOES HE NOT WANT PEOPLE TO

317
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:00,459
KNOW?

318
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:01,794
>> THEY DO NOT WANT TO COMMENT.

319
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,929
THEY KNOW THE U.S. MEDIA, WE ARE

320
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,231
ALL OVER THIS.

321
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,800
ALIBABA AND SEPTET, TELL US

322
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,267

323
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,102
THEY DO NOT WANT PEOPLE

324
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:17,843
SPECULATING.

325
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:18,611
ALIBABA IS A SUPER LONG-TERM

326

327
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,146
MOST OF WHAT HE SAID WAS OFF THE

328
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:24,250
RECORD BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS

329
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,651
THEY REALLY ARE LOOKING TO SEE

330
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:26,485
WHAT SEPTET IS DOING, HOW THEY

331
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,221

00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,867
COMPETITIVE THAN THE U.S..

756
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:13,604
RAMY: THE DEAL WAS STRUCTURED A

757
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:15,806
BIT UNUSUALLY, SOMEWHAT SAY.

758
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:16,607
OTHERS WOULD SAY A LITTLE MORE

759
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:17,475
BLUNTLY.

760
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:20,678
IT LOOKS LIKE A REVERSE MERGER.

761
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,379
I WANT TO GIVE YOU THE

762
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,714
OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT.

763
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:24,548
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO FOLKS WHO SAY

764
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:26,150
IT IS A REVERSE MERGER?

765
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,519
>> IN A REVERSE MERGER, WE WOULD

766
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,589
GET STOCK OFF THE PUBLIC

767
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:32,557
ENTITIES.

768
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,525
THAT IS NOT WHAT IS HAPPENING.

769
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,294
THERE IS A REASON THIS

770
00:36:37,294 --> 00:36:38,062
TRANSACTION IS STRUCTURED THIS

771
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:46,203
WAY.

772
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:47,037
WE WANT TO TRANSFER TO A GLOBAL

773
00:36:47,037 --> 00:36:48,773
AND SCALABLE BUSINESS.

774
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:49,540
THEY HAVE THE PLAN AND THE

775
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,511
FUNDING LIVE -- LINED UP.

776
00:36:53,511 --> 00:36:55,613
BUT IT IS A TIME-CONSUMING

777
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:57,515
PROCESS.

778
00:36:57,515 --> 00:37:02,686
IF YOU ARE IN A COMPETITIVE

779
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:03,454
BIDDING PROCESS AND HAVE TO GO

780
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:04,121
THROUGH A TIME-CONSUMING

781
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:04,855
REGULATORY PROCESS, THERE IS A

782
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:05,589
GOOD CHANCE YOU WILL NOT MAKE

783
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:05,890
IT.

784
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,492
THIS WAS A COMPETITIVE PROCESS.

785
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,928
THE ONLY WAY WE COULD HAVE DONE

786
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:11,595
THIS WAS THIS PARTICULAR

787
00:37:11,595 --> 00:37:15,533
STRUCTURE WHERE THEY START A

THAT CONSORTIUM BY MEDIA.NET

ENTIRELY, AND ONCE WE GET THE

791
00:37:21,806 --> 00:37:24,175
REGULATORY TOOLS IN CHINA, IT

792
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:31,582
WILL BECOME PART OF MCDONOUGH.

793
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,417
BASICALLY, IN A REVERSE

794
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,418
MORTGAGE, YOU HAVE THE PRIVATE

00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:38,355
COMPANY GETTING SHARES OF A

796

PUBLIC COMPANY.

797
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:44,128
RAMY: LAST YEAR, CHINA MADE A

798
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:44,895
CALL FOR MORE INVESTMENT INTO

799
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,698
THE AD TECH SPACE.

800
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:51,735
SOME SEE IT AS POTENTIALLY

801
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:52,369
SAYING, WE NEED HELP.

802
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:56,974
CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH -- HOW

803
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:57,775
FAR BEHIND IS CHINA COMPARED TO

804
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:58,309
THE UNITED STATES?

805
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:02,713
>> THAT HAPPENED FOR A COUPLE

806
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:03,113
REASONS.

807
00:38:03,113 --> 00:38:06,016
ONLINE ADVERTISING AS A GLOBAL

808
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:06,851
BUSINESS IS A MASSIVE BUSINESS.

809
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,786
EVEN AT THAT SIZE, YOU WOULD

810
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,857
NEED -- $200 BILLION THIS YEAR

811
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:16,160
AND GROWING.

812
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,994
IN CHINA, IT IS GROWING FASTER

813
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,829
THAN THE OTHER MARKETS.

814
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:24,134
CHINA HAS NATURAL HURDLES THAT

815
00:38:24,134 --> 00:38:25,503
EXIST TO ENTER THE MARKET,

816
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,438
ESPECIALLY FOR FOREIGN

817
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:27,905
COUNTRIES.

818
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:29,974
IT IS LESS SOPHISTICATED.

819
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,943
IT IS BEHIND THE U.S..

820
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:35,880
IT WILL BE A YEAR OR TWO BEHIND

821
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,881
THE U.S., MAYBE MORE.

822
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:38,983
AT THE SAME TIME, IT HAS A

823
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:42,253
UNIQUE SET OF CHALLENGES.

824
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:43,087
THE CHINA MANDATE MAY NOT JUST

825
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,890
BE TO GROW WITHIN CHINA, WHICH

826
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,957
IS OBVIOUSLY GREAT.

827
00:38:46,957 --> 00:39:01,105
THE OVERALL MANDATE LONG-TERM IS

828
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:01,839
YOU WILL SEE AN INCREASE IN

829
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,473
OUTBOUND INVESTMENTS FOR

830
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:03,274
COMPANIES THAT ARE GLOBAL, THAT

831
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:03,974
HAVE SCALE, A REAL BUSINESS

832
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:04,675
MODEL THAT WILL BE LONG-TERM

833
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:05,109
SUSTAINABLE.

834
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:05,776
THAT IS WHAT MCDONAGH AND

835
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:10,281
CHAIRMAN ZHANG WANT TO DO.

836
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,316
THE GOAL IS TO NOT ONLY ADD

837
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:13,117
CHINA AS A MARKET BUT DOUBLE

838
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:16,187
DOWN ON U.S. AND EUROPEAN

839
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:16,687
CHALLENGES.

840
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,256
RAMY: YOU ARE AN ENTREPRENEUR.

841
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:20,091
WHAT IS NEXT?

842
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:23,427
>> MY PLAN IS TO CONTINUE WITH

843
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,496
THESE GUYS.

844
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,531
THAT WAS ONE OF THE PRIMARY

845
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,299
REASONS WHEN WE HAD SEVERAL

846
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:31,202
OPTIONS -- THREE OPTIONS FROM

847
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:36,374
THE U.S., EUROPE, AND CHINA.

848
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,309
THE HIGHEST BID WAS ABOUT 20%.

849
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:42,046
THE HIGHEST U.S. BID WAS FROM A

850
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,249
WELL-KNOWN PE FUND.

851
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:52,856
PE FUNDS WOULD WANT TO DISCOUNT

852
00:39:52,856 --> 00:39:53,624
THE VALUE BECAUSE THEY NEED TO

853
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:54,325
MAKE UPSIDE ON THEIR EXIT.

854
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,694
FROM A VALUE STANDPOINT, WE

855
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:57,461
THOUGHT WE WERE AT THE SAME

856
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:01,832
POINT.

857
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:02,666
THE PRIMARY DIFFERENTIATOR WAS

858
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:04,969
ALL THESE DIFFERENT VALUE ADDS

859
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:05,669

VARIOUS SIZES.

ACROSS THE NEXT FEW YEARS, -- WE

866
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:26,791
HAVE COMPLETED OUR FIRST PHASE.

867
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:27,625

THIS FIRST PHASE.

AS WE ENTER THE SECOND PHASE OF

00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:29,693
GROWTH, WE EXPECT TO MULTIPLY

871
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:30,427
THE BUSINESS FROM WHERE IT IS

872
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:30,761
TODAY.

873
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,730
I WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT.

00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:33,597

QUITE TENSE BECAUSE EMPLOYEES

943
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:27,391
CAPITAL IN 2014.

944
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,894
YOU ARE SEEING THAT TAPER OFF

945
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,665
QUITE A BIT.

946
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:35,432
IT IS SQUEEZING THE STARTUP

947
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,601
SECTOR MORE BROADLY.

948
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:38,435
THE CHALLENGES FOR FLIPKART ARE

949
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:42,105
MORE INTENSE BECAUSE OF THE

950
00:45:42,105 --> 00:45:42,839
TARGETING OF AMAZON INTO THE

951
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:45,209
INDIA MARKET.

952
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,344
AMAZON HAS SAID IT WILL SPEND

953
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:48,078
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HIRING

954
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:48,478
EMPLOYEES.

955
00:45:48,478 --> 00:45:49,313
IT IS MARKETING AGGRESSIVELY IN

956
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:54,284
THE MARKET.

957
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:55,118
IT WANTS TO TAKE A BIG SLICE OF

958
00:45:55,118 --> 00:45:58,822
THE E-COMMERCE MARKET IN INDIA.

959
00:45:58,822 --> 00:45:59,656
THAT PUTS PRESSURE ON FLIPKART.

960
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:06,029
RAMY: WHAT WOULD THEY

961
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,531
SPECIFICALLY NEED TO DO IN ORDER

962
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:08,298
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FLIPKART

963
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:08,765
TURNING OVER?

964
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:12,369
>> WELL, THE MARKET IS GROWING

965
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:15,639
VERY QUICKLY IN AMAZON.

966
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:20,577
THE RETAIL MARKET IN INDIA IS

967
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:21,345
QUITE FRACTURED AT THIS POINT,

968
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:23,680
EVEN MORE THAN THE U.S..

969
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,548
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO NOT JUST

970
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,350
SELL GOODS RELIABLY AND GET THEM

971
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:30,120
TO CUSTOMERS RELIABLY.

972
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:30,954
YOU NEED THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN

973
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:31,688
PLACE TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT

974
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,991
GROWTH.

975
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:34,858
AMAZON HAS LOTS OF EXPERIENCE IN

976
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:35,659
THE U.S. AND HAS DONE REASONABLY

977
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,528
WELL IN OTHER MARKETS, BUT THIS

978
00:46:38,528 --> 00:46:39,329
MARKET IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER THEY

979
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:39,997
HAVE COMPETED IN.

980
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:44,902
RAMY: HOW CAN FLIPKART MOUNT A

981
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:45,535
RESPONSE TO AMAZON?

982
00:46:45,535 --> 00:46:45,969
CAN THEY?

983
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,671
>> FLIPKART HAS AN ADVANTAGE

984
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:48,038
HERE.

985
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:50,541
THEY ARE AHEAD AT THIS POINT.

986
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:55,112
THEY ALSO HAVE DOMESTIC

987
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:55,979
KNOWLEDGE THAT PROBABLY WORKS TO

988
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:56,713
THEIR ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF

989
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:59,783
LANGUAGE, CUSTOMIZING APPS,

990
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:00,584
RECOMMENDATIONS MAKE A BIG

991
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:03,654
DIFFERENCE, TOO.

992
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:07,357
THEY HAVE A BIT OF A LEAD, BUT

993
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:08,625
THEY NEED TO CONTINUE TO

994
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:12,529
INNOVATE, EXPAND GEOGRAPHICALLY,

995
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:13,330
AND ADD MORE MERCHANTS TO STAY

996
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:13,864
AHEAD OF AMAZON.

997
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:19,937
RAMY: PETER, STAY RIGHT THERE.

998
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:20,737
I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON

999
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:25,242
ANOTHER STORY, CHINA SMARTPHONE

1000
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:26,109
MAKERS WITH THEIR SIGHTS SET ON

1001
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:27,978
THE U.S.

1002
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:29,746
DO THEY REALLY STAND A CHANCE?

1003
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:35,085
SHIRA OVIDE IS NOT SO SURE.

1004
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:35,919
SHE JOINS US RIGHT HERE IN NEW

1005
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:38,255
YORK.

1006
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:39,122
WHAT IS THE TAKE AWAY FROM THAT

1007
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:39,489
PIECE?

1008
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:44,728
>> THE TAKEAWAY IS WE HAVE SEEN

1009
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:45,929
IN RECENT WEEKS A NUMBER OF

1010
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,731
CHINESE HANDSET MAKERS SAYING

1011
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:48,899
THEY'RE GOING AFTER THE U.S.

1012
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:57,574
XIAOMI AND HUAWEI ARE GOING TO

1013
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:58,375
GO AFTER THE U.S. WITH HIGH-END

1014
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:58,809
SMARTPHONES.

1015
00:47:58,809 --> 00:47:59,543
THE BATTLE SHOULD BE REALLY

1016
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,010
INTERESTING.

1017
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,113
RAMY: THE INTERESTING PART IS IN

1018
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:05,182
TERMS OF SPECS?

1019
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:08,552
PRICING?

1020
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,386
HOW CAN APPLE AND SAMSUNG DEFEND

1021
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:09,886
THEMSELVES?

1022
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:12,055
>> APPLE AND SAMSUNG IN THE U.S.

1023
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:16,727
DIVY UP THE MARKET.

1024
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:17,594
THEY HAVE OUTSIZED MARKET SHARE

1025
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:18,295
COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE

1026
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:19,463
WORLD.

1027
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:20,263
THE THING THAT IS INTERESTING

1028
00:48:20,263 --> 00:48:26,036
ABOUT XIAOMI AND HUAWEI IS

1029
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:27,504
THEY ARE MAKING HIGH-END PHONES

1030
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:28,171
FOR NOT HIGH-END PRICES.

1031
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:36,012
KIND OF AN $800 TOPLINE PRICE WE

1032
00:48:36,012 --> 00:48:36,847
HAVE COME TO EXPECT FROM SAMSUNG

1033
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:37,347
AND THE IPHONE.

1034
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:43,386
RAMY: WITH XIAOMI, HUGO BARRA

1035
00:48:43,386 --> 00:48:44,121
WAS ON BLOOMBERG RECENTLY

1036
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,155
TALKING ABOUT THEIR STRONG

1037
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,824
INTENT TO GET INTO PLAY.

1038
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:48,658
I WANT TO GET INTO A LITTLE OF

1039
00:48:48,658 --> 00:48:49,025
THAT.

1040
00:48:49,025 --> 00:48:52,062
>> WE WILL LEAD WITH CHANNELS

1041
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:53,330
THAT ALLOW US TO GET IN TOUCH

1042
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,931
WITH A YOUNG GENERATION THAT IS

1043
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:57,534
ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT TECHNOLOGY.

1044
00:48:57,534 --> 00:48:59,436
DEFINITELY GOING TO MAKE OUR WAY

1045
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,904
THERE.

1046
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:13,950
RAMY: DO YOU THINK XIAOMI WILL

1047
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:14,551
BE ABLE TO BREAK IN?

1048
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,620
>> HUAWEI WILL HAVE A BETTER

1049
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,020
CHANCE.

1050
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:17,754
THEY HAVE INCREDIBLE EXPERTISE

1051
00:49:17,754 --> 00:49:18,488
IN TELECOM AND CHIPS WHICH HAS

1052
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:19,256
ALLOWED THEM PRICING ADVANTAGE

1053
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,525
WHICH XIAOMI DOES NOT HAVE.

1054
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:26,029
IF ANYONE CAN MAKE INROADS, IT

1055
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:26,730
MIGHT BE THEM IN TERMS OF

1056
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:27,364
CHINESE HANDSET MAKERS.

1057
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:28,131
RAMY: PETER, I WANT TO BRING YOU

1058
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:28,765
IN.

1059
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:30,500
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHAT IS

1060
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,334
HAPPENING WITH CHINESE AND U.S.

1061
00:49:31,334 --> 00:49:32,102
SMARTPHONE MAKERS IN TERMS OF

1062
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:33,336
THEM TRYING TO GET IN THERE?

1063
00:49:33,336 --> 00:49:38,308
>> I THINK THE CHINESE

1064
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,075
SMARTPHONE MAKERS ARE GOING TO

1065
00:49:39,075 --> 00:49:41,244
HAVE A HARD TIME IN THE U.S.

1066
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,112
MARKET FOR A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT

1067
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:44,881
REASONS.

1068
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:46,883
I THINK, FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEED

1069
00:49:46,883 --> 00:49:48,485
TO THINK ABOUT WHICH OF THESE

1070
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,086
COMPANIES IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO

1071
00:49:50,086 --> 00:49:50,921
AGGRESSIVELY MOVING TO THE U.S.

1072
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:53,957
XIAOMI IS USING A BUSINESS MODEL

1073
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:57,160
THAT HAS HISTORICALLY NOT WORKED

1074
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:03,433
IN THE U.S.

1075
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:04,167
THEY ARE TRYING TO BYPASS

1076
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:04,901
CARRIERS WITHOUT SUBSIDIES.

1077
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:05,669
U.S. CONSUMERS LIKE TO GET THAT

1078
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:06,436
SUBSIDY WHEN THEY SIGN UP FOR A

1079
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:06,836
CONTRACT.

1080
00:50:06,836 --> 00:50:08,371
SELLING TO THEM DIRECTLY ONLINE

1081
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:09,105
HAS BEEN TRIED IN THE PAST AND

1082
00:50:09,105 --> 00:50:09,606
IT NEVER WORKS.

1083
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:14,010
IN TERMS OF HUAWEI, THEY HAVE

1084
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,446
SOME TECHNOLOGY ADVANTAGES.

1085
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:17,247
THEY JUMPED TO THE TOP OF THE

1086
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:17,948
CHINESE SMARTPHONE MARKET

1087
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:21,451
SERIOUS -- QUICKLY.

1088
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:22,219
BUT THE NAME SETS OFF ALARM

1089
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,054
BELLS IN THE U.S. FOR A VARIETY

1090
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:27,257
OF REASONS, NOT ALL OF THEM

1091
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:29,493
NECESSARILY WELL-FOUNDED.

1092
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:30,360
U.S. CARRIERS ARE NOT GOING TO

1093
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,997
SUPPORT HUAWEI COMING TO THE

1094
00:50:33,997 --> 00:50:35,699
U.S. AND A BIG WAY AND GIVE THEM

1095
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,433
THE SUBSIDIES TO TAKE MARKET

1096
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:36,800
SHARE.

1097
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,535
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER

1098
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:42,706
PLAYERS IN CHINA, THOSE

1099
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:43,540
COMPANIES DO NOT HAVE AMBITIONS

1100
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,675
TO MOVE INTO THE U.S. MARKET.

1101
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:46,443
HAVING SAID THAT, THE U.S.

1102
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:47,511
MARKET IS TUMULTUOUS.

1103
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,379
YOU HAVE SEEN TONS OF CHANGE.

1104
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:53,316
APPLE AND SAMSUNG'S DOMINANCE IS

1105
00:50:53,316 --> 00:50:53,917
A BIT OF AN ANOMALY.

1106
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:57,354
RAMY: I WANT TO GET YOUR

1107
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:58,955
THOUGHTS ON CRITICISMS ABOUT

1108
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:00,490
XIAOMI.

1109
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:02,392
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT IS

1110
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,495
AN ALL-OUT COPYCAT OF APPLE.

1111
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:08,131
DO YOU THINK THIS HAS ANY LEGS

1112
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:08,531
TO IT?

1113
00:51:08,531 --> 00:51:16,373
>> HISTORICALLY, XIAOMI HAD I.P.

1114
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:17,140
PROBLEMS GETTING STARTED IN

1115
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:17,607
CHINA.

1116
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:21,278
THEY DID NOT HAVE THE I.P. OTHER

1117
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:21,811
COMPANIES HAD.

1118
00:51:21,811 --> 00:51:24,848
THAT HAS CHANGED.

1119
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:25,649
THEY WENT TO MICROSOFT, WHICH

1120
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:28,518
BOUGHT THE NOKIA SMARTPHONE

1121
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,720
BUSINESS, AND THEY BOUGHT A TON

1122
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,655
OF PATENTS FROM THEM.

1123
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:33,123
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DEFEND

1124
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,691
THAT.

1125
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:36,593
AT INDUSTRY GATHERINGS, YOU NEED

1317
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:48,444
THAT FILM MADE MORE THAN $140

1318
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,446

THE LOWER BACK TATTOO."

1325

THE BOOK IS LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY

1326
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:13,335

CHARLIE: DID YOU REALLY?

1346
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:46,669
WHY NOW, TO WRITE THIS BOOK?
