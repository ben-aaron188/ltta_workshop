IF YOU HAVE WORKERS THAT ARE

94
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:25,085
FOCUSED ON LEGACY PRODUCTS,

95
00:02:25,085 --> 00:02:27,220
THERE'S NOT MUCH WORK FOR THEM.

96
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,225
LOOK AT THEIR SWITCHING OR

97
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:32,993
ROUTING BUSINESSES, THEY ARE

98
00:02:32,993 --> 00:02:35,161
DECLINING OR SLIGHTLY GROWING.

99
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:36,029
THERE'S NOT MUCH GROWTH THERE

100
00:02:36,029 --> 00:02:36,563
ANYMORE.

101
00:02:36,563 --> 00:02:37,297
THE NEWER AREAS THEY ARE

102
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:41,268
INVESTING IN, THEY JUST GOT INTO

103
00:02:41,268 --> 00:02:43,536
ANALYTICS A COUPLE OF MONTHS

104
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:43,870
AGO.

105
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,471
THOSE ARE EXAMPLES.

106
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:49,776
EMILY: WHEN YOU LOOK AT LEGACY

107
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:50,510
PRODUCT GROWTH, HOW FAST OUR

108
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,313
SALES UP THERE LEGACY PRODUCTS?

109
00:02:53,313 --> 00:02:56,349
CORY: OVERALL THE REVENUE

110
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:59,886
NUMBERS ARE DOWN 2%.

111
00:02:59,886 --> 00:03:01,688
IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR VIDEO

112
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:02,489
BUSINESS WHICH THEY GOT RID OF A

113
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:05,892
YEAR AGO, SALES WERE UP 2%.

114
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:06,726
ALL THE EXISTING PRODUCT LINES

115
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:07,494
ON AVERAGE WERE UP 2%.

116
00:03:07,494 --> 00:03:12,032
THE SWITCHING BUSINESS IS UP 3%

117
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:19,038
YEAR OVER YEAR.

118
00:03:19,038 --> 00:03:19,873
THE SECURITY BUSINESS WAS UP 16%

119
00:03:19,873 --> 00:03:22,876
ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BUSINESS, SO

120
00:03:22,876 --> 00:03:26,780
TERRIFIC GROWTH INSECURITY.

121
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,217
IT'S WORTH THINKING ABOUT IN

122
00:03:31,217 --> 00:03:32,685
THIS TIME IN WHICH THE CUTTING

123
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:34,788
EDGE TECHNOLOGY OF SWITCHES IS A

124
00:03:34,788 --> 00:03:36,890
SOFTWARE DEFINED NETWORK.

125
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,291
CHOOSING ONE SWITCH OR ROUTER

126
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,794
AND USING SOFTWARE TO DO THE JOB

127
00:03:40,794 --> 00:03:42,662
OF MANY ROUTERS.

128
00:03:42,662 --> 00:03:46,833
IN AN ERA WHEN SOFTWARE DEFINED

129
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:52,138
NETWORKS ARE LETTING IT GET MORE

130
00:03:52,138 --> 00:03:52,906
OUT OF INDIVIDUAL SWITCHES AND

131
00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:53,673
ROUTERS, THESE NUMBERS REALLY

132
00:03:53,673 --> 00:03:54,207
ARE NOT THAT BAD.

133
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:59,212

YEAR.

136
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,581
I SAT DOWN WITH THE NEW CEO

00:04:01,581 --> 00:04:02,348
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WHO TOOK

138
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:07,554

139
00:04:07,554 --> 00:04:08,388

141
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:10,056
MANAGEMENT TURNOVER AT THE TOP

142
00:04:10,056 --> 00:04:11,858
OF CISCO.

143
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:17,230
I ASKED WHY IS THAT HAPPENING.

144
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,065
LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.

145
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:22,936
>> WE HAD TO MOVE FORWARD AND

146
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:23,736
THE THING WE DON'T WRITE

147
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:25,205
ARTICLES ABOUT ARE ALL THE

148
00:04:25,205 --> 00:04:28,742
PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL HERE.

149
00:04:28,742 --> 00:04:31,077
JOHN DEVELOPED A TREMENDOUS

150
00:04:31,077 --> 00:04:33,613
BENCH AND WE WENT THROUGH THIS

151
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:34,414
DISCUSSION WHEN I FIRST TOOK THE

152
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:34,747
JOB.

153
00:04:34,747 --> 00:04:39,085
ANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND

154
00:04:39,085 --> 00:04:40,387
WHAT I ASKED THEM FOR WAS TO

155
00:04:40,387 --> 00:04:41,087
COMMIT TO THREE YEARS.

156
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,957
SEVERAL HAD ASPIRATIONS TO

160
00:04:51,097 --> 00:04:53,700
BUT THE BENCH THAT WAS CREATED

161
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,400
ALLOWED US TO BUILD THE

162
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,168
NEXT-GENERATION LEADERSHIP TEAM

163
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:58,571
THAT HAS PUT US IN A POSITION TO

EXECUTE MORE EFFECTIVELY IN THE

BRIAN: DEFINITELY.

193
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:06,339
IF YOU LOOK AT RECURRING REVENUE

194
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:08,808
, IT'S UP FROM 25% A YEAR AGO.

195
00:06:08,808 --> 00:06:13,480
IF YOU LOOK AT DEFERRED REVENUE

196
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,347
AND SOFTWARE AND SUBSCRIPTIONS

197
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:16,950
IT WAS UP 33% YEAR OVER YEAR.

198
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,919
MARGINS SHOULD GO UP OVER TIME

199
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:20,353
FOR SURE.

200
00:06:20,353 --> 00:06:24,090
EMILY: CISCO WAS A BELLWETHER OF

201
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,628
THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY AND ITS

202
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:30,330
LOSS THAT ICONIC STATUS, BUT

203
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,297
WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE PLACE FOR

204
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:33,666
CISCO IN THE BROADER PICTURE

205
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,402
NOW?

206
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:36,236
WHY IS CISCO STILL IMPORTANT?

207
00:06:36,236 --> 00:06:40,440
CORY: IT'S HARDWARE IS LESS

208
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,175
IMPORTANT IN THE ERA OF THE

209
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:47,146
CLOUD.

210
00:06:47,146 --> 00:06:48,214
THEY'RE USING AMAZON WEB

211
00:06:48,214 --> 00:06:52,518
SERVICES, AND YET WHEN YOU LOOK

212
00:06:52,518 --> 00:06:54,220
AT WHAT CISCO HAS BEEN ABLE TO

213
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,522
DO, CISCO HAS REMAINED RELEVANT

214
00:06:56,522 --> 00:06:59,392
WHEN ITS COMPETITORS HAVE NOT.

215
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:02,762
WHEN HEWLETT-PACKARD, DELL, IBM

216
00:07:02,762 --> 00:07:05,298
ARE FALLING APART, I THINK IT'S

217
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:05,999
WORTH NOTING THAT CISCO IS

218
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:08,334
SELLING HARDWARE IN ADDITION TO

219
00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:11,571

SUCCEEDING WHERE ITS COMPETITORS

221
00:07:12,372 --> 00:07:12,772

224
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:23,349

225

PEAKED, AND THE SHARES HAVE NOT

226
00:07:27,854 --> 00:07:29,355
MOVED MUCH IN THE PAST DECADE

227
00:07:29,355 --> 00:07:31,491

232
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:42,535
PEOPLE CAN LOOK AT MARGINS AND

233
00:07:42,535 --> 00:07:45,672
SAY THEY ARE GOING HIGHER, NOT

234
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:48,074
LOWER, WHICH IS VERY STRANGE FOR

235
00:07:48,074 --> 00:07:51,944
WEB PEOPLE, IT'S BECOMING MORE

236
00:07:51,944 --> 00:07:52,612

237
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:57,684
A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS, THIS

238
00:07:57,684 --> 00:08:00,887
COMPANY HAS GROWN 7% EURO THE

239
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:02,889

THEY TRADE AT 22 TIMES EARNINGS.

MONSTER VALUATION?

260

ONE EXPERT SAYS NO.

261
00:08:58,178 --> 00:09:02,515
HE CRUNCHED THE NUMBERS AND SAYS

262
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:05,151
THEY SHOULD BE VALUED AT SOUTH

00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:09,455
IT CURRENTLY HAS.

266
00:09:09,455 --> 00:09:10,256
THE MAIN REASON HE SAYS IS

00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:14,160
PROFIT.

268
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,662
HE SAYS DISRUPTION IS EASY BUT

269
00:09:16,662 --> 00:09:17,430
MAKING MONEY OFF DISRUPTION IS

270
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,532
DIFFICULT.

00:15:13,286 --> 00:15:17,089
CONTROL ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

378
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:17,957
SO I THINK BY STEPPING AWAY FROM

379
00:15:17,957 --> 00:15:20,259
THIS FINALLY, WE ACTUALLY REMOVE

380
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:23,095
A LOT OF THAT PRESSURE TO MAKE

381
00:15:23,095 --> 00:15:23,796
IT MUCH MORE EGALITARIAN.

382
00:15:23,796 --> 00:15:26,198
EMILY: ASSUMING THIS DOES HAPPEN

383
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:27,266
AS PLANNED, WHAT WILL BE

384
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:30,536
DIFFERENT?

385
00:15:30,536 --> 00:15:31,303
WILL INDIVIDUAL USERS EVEN

386
00:15:31,303 --> 00:15:34,440
NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE?

387
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,074
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

388
00:15:35,074 --> 00:15:36,275
THE CURRENT ROLE THAT THE U.S.

389
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:40,079
GOVERNMENT HAS IS TO VERIFY THAT

390
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,048
THE CHANGES TO THE ROOT ZONE OF

391
00:15:43,048 --> 00:15:45,217
THE DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM HAVE BEEN

392
00:15:45,217 --> 00:15:48,254
PROPERLY CATERED FOR IN THE

393
00:15:48,254 --> 00:15:49,088
PROCESSES THAT LEAD UP TO THOSE

394
00:15:49,088 --> 00:15:51,457
CHANGES.

395
00:15:51,457 --> 00:15:53,392
A ROUTER NEEDS TO BE POINTED TO

396
00:15:53,392 --> 00:15:57,363
A DIFFERENT IP ADDRESS, AND THE

397
00:15:57,363 --> 00:15:58,230
U.S. GOVERNMENT'S ROLE IS MERELY

398
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:05,437
TO CHECK THAT IT'S BEEN

399
00:16:05,437 --> 00:16:06,739
PERFORMED WITH DUE DILIGENCE,

400
00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:07,306
THAT'S ALL.

401
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:08,040
WHEN THEY STEP AWAY FROM THAT

402
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,275
PARTICULAR FUNCTION, ALL THE

403
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:11,143
MECHANICS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME,

404
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:13,512
EXCEPT WE WON'T GO THROUGH THIS

405
00:16:13,512 --> 00:16:15,815
LOOP, OTHERWISE IT IS EXACTLY

406
00:16:15,815 --> 00:16:16,215
THE SAME.

407
00:16:16,215 --> 00:16:18,617
EMILY: AS ONE OF THE FATHERS OF

408
00:16:18,617 --> 00:16:22,521
THE INTERNET, I KNOW THAT'S WHAT

409
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:23,889
YOU'RE CONSIDERED TO BE.

410
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:24,957
HAD HE THINK OVERSIGHT OF THE

411
00:16:24,957 --> 00:16:25,825
INTERNET HAS PLAYED OUT OVER THE

412
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:28,627
LAST COUPLE OF DECADES AND HOW

413
00:16:28,627 --> 00:16:29,395
DO YOU EXPECT IT TO PLAY OUT

414
00:16:29,395 --> 00:16:32,665
OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES?

415
00:16:32,665 --> 00:16:35,734
>> FOR THOSE WHO ARE WATCHING

416
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:36,735
AND LISTENING, THE U.S.

417
00:16:36,735 --> 00:16:37,503
GOVERNMENT WAS THE ORIGIN OF

418
00:16:37,503 --> 00:16:38,037
THIS PROJECT.

419
00:16:38,037 --> 00:16:39,772
IT STARTED IN THE DEFENSE

420
00:16:39,772 --> 00:16:43,108
DEPARTMENT, AND I'M VERY PROUD

421
00:16:43,108 --> 00:16:45,010
NOT ONLY OF THE DEFENSE

422
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:45,778
DEPARTMENT BUT OTHER PARTS OF

423
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:46,545
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING

424
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:48,414
THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION,

425
00:16:48,414 --> 00:16:51,717
FOR PERSISTENTLY STEPPING AWAY

426
00:16:51,717 --> 00:16:55,921
FROM CONTROL OVER THE SYSTEM AND

427
00:16:55,921 --> 00:16:56,555
TURNING IT OVER TO A

428
00:16:56,555 --> 00:16:57,289
MULTI-STAKEHOLDER OPERATION.

429
00:16:57,289 --> 00:17:02,461
WHEN WE WERE IN THE DEFENSE

430
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:03,295
DEPARTMENT, WE BASICALLY MADE

431
00:17:03,295 --> 00:17:04,630
THE PRIMARY DECISIONS AND POLICY

432
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:09,034
ON WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INTERNET

433
00:17:09,034 --> 00:17:09,835
THAT EXPANDED TO MULTIPLE PARTS

434
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:10,502
OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT,

435
00:17:10,502 --> 00:17:16,775
INCLUDING NASA AND MSF AS WELL

436
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:18,176
AS THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY.

437
00:17:18,176 --> 00:17:20,512
STEP BY STEP, THE GOVERNMENT HAS

438
00:17:20,512 --> 00:17:21,446
WITHDRAWN FROM ITS CONTROL

439
00:17:21,446 --> 00:17:22,314
OVERSIGHT, AND THIS IS THE LAST

440
00:17:22,314 --> 00:17:24,150
STEP.

441
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:28,621
EMILY: THERE HAS BEEN TALK THAT

442
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:31,323
THE INTERNET HAS BECOME TOO BIG.

443
00:17:31,323 --> 00:17:32,157
IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THE INTERNET

444
00:17:32,157 --> 00:17:36,195
TO BECOME TOO BIG, TO RUN OUT OF

445
00:17:36,195 --> 00:17:40,299
IP ADDRESSES AND DOMAIN NAMES?

446
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:44,003
>> WE CERTAINLY WON'T RUN OUT OF

447
00:17:44,003 --> 00:17:44,470
DOMAIN NAMES.

448
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,237
WE HAVE AUTHORIZED THE CREATION

449
00:17:45,237 --> 00:17:48,440
OF SOME 2000 DOMAIN NAMES, IN

450
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,241
ADDITION TO THE SEVEN WE STARTED

451
00:17:49,241 --> 00:17:52,578
WITH ACT IN THE MID-1980'S.

00:21:29,761 --> 00:21:34,466
ORIGINALLY EXPECTED BY AIRBNB.

488
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:35,300
I SAT DOWN WITH THE MANAGER OF

489
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,237
AIRBNB BRAZIL AND ASK ABOUT THE

490
00:21:38,237 --> 00:21:39,071

491
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:40,773

THAT IS GREAT NEWS FOR EVERYONE

497
00:21:59,224 --> 00:22:04,062

498
00:22:04,062 --> 00:22:04,830
HIGH ECONOMIC IMPACT FOR THE

MAKING THIS HAPPEN?

522
00:23:01,453 --> 00:23:04,323
IMPORTANT CHAPTER SINCE 2015

523
00:23:04,323 --> 00:23:13,932

WAY.

527
00:23:17,069 --> 00:23:21,073
AIRBNB IS A GREAT SOLUTION FOR

528
00:23:21,073 --> 00:23:21,807
CITIES THAT WANT TO INCREASE

529
00:23:21,807 --> 00:23:23,408

THE CONVERSATION HAPPENED

531
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:29,648
NATIONALLY AND IN 2016 WE SIGNED

532
00:23:29,648 --> 00:23:32,184
A PARTNERSHIP TO ENSURE THAT

533
00:23:32,184 --> 00:23:32,985
EVERYONE WANTING TO COME TO RIO

534
00:23:32,985 --> 00:23:33,685

535
00:23:33,685 --> 00:23:34,019
STAY.

536
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:35,821
EMILY: YOU WERE UP AGAINST A

537
00:23:35,821 --> 00:23:40,793
COUPLE OF OTHER LOCAL

538
00:23:40,793 --> 00:23:41,560
ACCOMMODATION PROVIDERS AND

539
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,361
THERE'S NO ACTUAL HISTORY OF

540
00:23:42,361 --> 00:23:43,028
THERE BEING AN OFFICIAL

541
00:23:43,028 --> 00:23:45,063
ACCOMMODATIONS ALTERNATIVE.

542
00:23:45,063 --> 00:23:45,864
WHAT DID IT TAKE TO CLOSE THAT

543
00:23:45,864 --> 00:23:50,102
DEAL WITH BRAZIL?

544
00:23:50,102 --> 00:23:51,937
>> I THINK THE CITY OF RIO IS

545
00:23:51,937 --> 00:23:58,243
THE CITY THAT PRESENTED AN

546
00:23:58,243 --> 00:23:59,111
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALTERNATIVE

547
00:23:59,111 --> 00:24:02,314
ACCOMMODATIONS BECAUSE THERE ARE

548
00:24:02,314 --> 00:24:02,948
SO MANY PEOPLE ALREADY

549
00:24:02,948 --> 00:24:06,551
INTERESTED IN COMING TO THE GAME

550
00:24:06,551 --> 00:24:11,390
.

551
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,224
WITHOUT ADDITIONAL CAPACITY, YOU

552
00:24:12,224 --> 00:24:13,158
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE

553
00:24:13,158 --> 00:24:15,160
THOSE PEOPLE HERE FOR THE GAMES.

554
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,762
SO THAT'S WHY WE SIGNED UP FOR

555
00:24:16,762 --> 00:24:23,635
PARTICIPATION IN RIO 2016, TO

556
00:24:23,635 --> 00:24:24,803
ASSURE THAT EVERYONE WHO WANTED

557
00:24:24,803 --> 00:24:26,171
TO COME HAD A PLACE TO STAY.

558
00:24:26,171 --> 00:24:28,106
ONE YEAR LATER, HERE WE ARE WITH

559
00:24:28,106 --> 00:24:29,274
VERY POSITIVE NUMBERS AND MAKING

560
00:24:29,274 --> 00:24:29,741
HISTORY.

561
00:24:29,741 --> 00:24:32,778
ONE OF THE KEY LEGACY IS FOR THE

562
00:24:32,778 --> 00:24:36,014
FIRST TIME WE ARE BRINGING A

563
00:24:36,014 --> 00:24:39,118

INVEST IN COMMUNICATION.

755
00:34:50,462 --> 00:34:54,032
IF THESE THINGS THAT YOU SEE ON

00:34:56,501 --> 00:34:58,470
TRANSLATE.

758
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:03,041
COMPANIES THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL,

759
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:04,542
THAT ARE GROWING THAT FAST, THEY

760
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:07,712
NEED TO TAKE DECADES OF

761
00:35:07,712 --> 00:35:08,513
KNOWLEDGE AND COMPRESS THEM IN

762
00:35:08,513 --> 00:35:09,080
TWO YEARS OR MONTHS.

763
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,249
I SEEING THINGS OURSELVES AND

764
00:35:11,249 --> 00:35:12,517
WHAT OTHER COMPANIES DO IN

765
00:35:12,517 --> 00:35:13,351
TRANSFERRING THAT KNOWLEDGE

766
00:35:13,351 --> 00:35:16,521
EFFECTIVELY IS HOW WE HELP.

767
00:35:16,521 --> 00:35:22,760
EMILY: IS DROPBOX EXPLORING AND

768
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,595
IPO?

769
00:35:23,595 --> 00:35:26,431
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE EXACT

770
00:35:26,431 --> 00:35:29,934
PLANS FOR THE COMPANY ARE.

771
00:35:29,934 --> 00:35:30,735
YOU SEEM THAT THE COMPANY HAS

772
00:35:30,735 --> 00:35:33,404
MADE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS IN

773
00:35:33,404 --> 00:35:35,506
TERMS OF CUTTING COSTS AND

774
00:35:35,506 --> 00:35:37,909
MOVING UP TO WEB SERVICES ON THE

775
00:35:37,909 --> 00:35:38,576
INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE.

776
00:35:38,576 --> 00:35:41,613
THE BUSINESS IS GROWING LIKE

777
00:35:41,613 --> 00:35:44,682
NICELY WITH OVER 200,000 PAYING

778
00:35:44,682 --> 00:35:45,817
BUSINESS CUSTOMERS.

779
00:35:45,817 --> 00:35:49,854
IT JUST REPORTED BEING CASH FLOW

780
00:35:49,854 --> 00:35:50,288
POSITIVE.

781
00:35:50,288 --> 00:35:52,623
ALL THE METRICS ARE THERE.

782
00:35:52,623 --> 00:35:53,524
IT'S UP TO THEM TO DECIDE WHEN

783
00:35:53,524 --> 00:35:54,792
TO DO IT BUT CERTAINLY THE

784
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:56,961
EXTERNAL MARKETS ARE QUITE

785
00:35:56,961 --> 00:35:57,495
POSITIVE TODAY.

786
00:35:57,495 --> 00:36:01,499
EMILY: THERE IS CONCERN THAT THE

787
00:36:01,499 --> 00:36:02,600
FILE SHARE MARKET IS NOT AS BIG

788
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:07,939
AS PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS AN

789
00:36:07,939 --> 00:36:10,141
DROPBOX NEEDS TO INCREASE ITS

790
00:36:10,141 --> 00:36:10,742
ADDRESSABLE MARKET.

791
00:36:10,742 --> 00:36:11,476
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT NEEDS TO

792
00:36:11,476 --> 00:36:13,211
DO?

793
00:36:13,211 --> 00:36:16,080
>> TO HAVE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY.

794
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,984
YOU'RE ASKING HOW DO WE HELP.

795
00:36:19,984 --> 00:36:22,687
ONE OF THE THINGS IS REALLY

796
00:36:22,687 --> 00:36:23,488
UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU SHOULD

797
00:36:23,488 --> 00:36:24,188
FOCUS ON AT A GIVEN TIME.

798
00:36:24,188 --> 00:36:27,158
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF

799
00:36:27,158 --> 00:36:27,892
TECHNOLOGY, COMPANIES LIKE

800
00:36:27,892 --> 00:36:28,693
MICROSOFT HAVE BECOME THESE

801
00:36:28,693 --> 00:36:33,498
GIANTS WITH FULL PRODUCT SUITES.

802
00:36:33,498 --> 00:36:34,232
DROPBOX IS AN INCREDIBLE

803
00:36:34,232 --> 00:36:36,601
OPPORTUNITY TO GO INTO BUSINESS

804
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:39,904
AND TAKE A HUGE MARKET SHARE AND

805
00:36:39,904 --> 00:36:41,072
ENTERPRISE INFRASTRUCTURE AND

806
00:36:41,072 --> 00:36:43,341
STORAGE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE

807
00:36:43,341 --> 00:36:45,676
TECHNICAL KNOW-HOW TO DO THAT,

808
00:36:45,676 --> 00:36:49,080
AND USE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY

809
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,814
TO MOVE INTO PRODUCTIVITY.

810
00:36:49,814 --> 00:36:50,548
THEY JUST LAUNCHED A PRODUCT

811
00:36:50,548 --> 00:36:54,085
CALLED PAPER WHICH IS

812
00:36:54,085 --> 00:36:54,552
PHENOMENAL.

813
00:36:54,552 --> 00:36:57,155
I THINK THEY WILL SEE MORE AND

814
00:36:57,155 --> 00:36:57,955
MORE OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THAT ON

815
00:36:57,955 --> 00:36:58,723
TOP OF A FOUNDATIONAL BUSINESS

816
00:36:58,723 --> 00:36:59,624
THAT'S GENERATING A LOT OF CASH.

817
00:36:59,624 --> 00:37:04,362
EMILY: THERE'S A DRY SPELL IN

818
00:37:04,362 --> 00:37:06,330
IPO'S AND THE TREND FOR

819
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,365
TECHNOLOGY IS TO STAY PRIVATE AS

820
00:37:07,365 --> 00:37:11,636
LONG AS POSSIBLE.

821
00:37:11,636 --> 00:37:12,937
WHAT ARE YOU TELLING YOUR

822
00:37:12,937 --> 00:37:14,539
PORTFOLIO COMPANIES RIGHT NOW

823
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:19,677
ABOUT BEING IPO READY?

824
00:37:19,677 --> 00:37:24,515
MARK ANDREESSEN SAID HE WAS

825
00:37:24,515 --> 00:37:25,349
COACHING ALL OF HIS COMPANIES TO

826
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:28,486
BE IPO READY.

827
00:37:28,486 --> 00:37:30,955
>> I THINK THIS HAS BEEN DRIVEN

828
00:37:30,955 --> 00:37:34,425
A LOT BY MARKET CONDITIONS,

829
00:37:34,425 --> 00:37:37,228
BEING CONTINUOUSLY READY NOT

830
00:37:37,228 --> 00:37:40,565
JUST FOR IPO READINESS BUT FROM

831
00:37:40,565 --> 00:37:45,336
A FUNDAMENTALS OF THE BUSINESS

832
00:37:45,336 --> 00:37:45,803
PERSPECTIVE.

833
00:37:45,803 --> 00:37:46,571
FOLKS ARE BECOMING A LOT MORE

834
00:37:46,571 --> 00:37:47,338

00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:52,910
ABOUT GROWING HEADCOUNT,

836
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:53,744
THINKING ABOUT WHAT TO FOCUS ON

837
00:37:53,744 --> 00:37:55,213
AS A BUSINESS.

838
00:37:55,213 --> 00:37:56,080
WE ARE ENCOURAGING HER COMPANIES

839
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,750
TO CONTINUOUSLY DO THAT.

840
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,752
IT IS JUST GENERALLY GOOD

841
00:38:01,752 --> 00:38:02,186
HYGIENE.

842
00:38:02,186 --> 00:38:02,987
YOU WANT TO MAINTAIN

843
00:38:02,987 --> 00:38:03,688
PROFITABILITY AND BE IN A

844
00:38:03,688 --> 00:38:04,822
POSITION OF STRENGTH.

845
00:38:04,822 --> 00:38:07,992
YOU WANT TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT

846
00:38:07,992 --> 00:38:08,826
HOW YOU SCALE THINGS, ESPECIALLY

847
00:38:08,826 --> 00:38:09,360
ON THE COST SIDE.

848
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:15,366
EMILY: THE SECONDARY MARKET

849
00:38:15,366 --> 00:38:17,068
WOULD ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO SEE

850
00:38:17,068 --> 00:38:17,869
SOME SORT OF RETURN ON THEIR

851
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:20,471
INVESTMENT, THOSE HAVE REALLY

852
00:38:20,471 --> 00:38:22,473
SHUT DOWN.

853
00:38:22,473 --> 00:38:23,374
SOME COMPANIES ARE EXPERIMENTING

854
00:38:23,374 --> 00:38:24,142
WITH WAYS TO GIVE SHARES TO

855
00:38:24,142 --> 00:38:28,946
EMPLOYEES BEFORE THEY HAVE SOME

856
00:38:28,946 --> 00:38:32,483
SORT OF ACQUISITION OR AN IPO.

857
00:38:32,483 --> 00:38:33,284
WHAT IS YOUR PHILOSOPHY AROUND

858
00:38:33,284 --> 00:38:36,087
THAT?

859
00:38:36,087 --> 00:38:37,855

860
00:38:37,855 --> 00:38:40,358
LIFEBLOOD OF COMPANIES.

861
00:38:40,358 --> 00:38:41,159
THAT'S WHAT MAKES COMPANY

862
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,126
SUCCESSFUL AT EVERY STAGE.

863
00:38:42,126 --> 00:38:43,794
DOING RIGHT BY YOUR EMPLOYEES

864

THE MISSION GOALS OF THE COMPANY

866
00:38:48,132 --> 00:38:51,135

WE ENCOURAGE OUR COMPANIES TO

00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:01,212
FOCUS ON BOTH OF THOSE.

873
00:39:01,212 --> 00:39:04,115
LIQUIDITY IS GOOD FOR EARLY

874
00:39:04,115 --> 00:39:05,450
EMPLOYEES.

875
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,350
YOU WANT TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT

876
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,319
HOW YOU DO IT.

877
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:12,256
YOU DON'T WANT TO OVERDO IT.

878
00:39:12,256 --> 00:39:14,725

00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:03,720
CHINESE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES.

1127
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,623
THEY'VE NOT HAD MUCH SUCCESS

1128
00:53:06,623 --> 00:53:08,392
EXPANDING INTO THE UNITED STATES

1129
00:53:08,392 --> 00:53:10,794
.

1130
00:53:10,794 --> 00:53:14,264
DO YOU THINK WE ARE SEEING A

1131
00:53:14,264 --> 00:53:16,833
CHANGING OF THE TIDES, WHERE

1132
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:17,667
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO

1133
00:53:17,667 --> 00:53:19,403
BE THERE AMBITION IN THE FUTURE,

1134
00:53:19,403 --> 00:53:21,605
AND THEY REALLY WILL WILL BE

1135
00:53:21,605 --> 00:53:24,808
FOCUSED ON THE MARKET IN CHINA?

1136
00:53:24,808 --> 00:53:27,844
>> THERE IS BIFURCATION

1137
00:53:27,844 --> 00:53:30,514
CERTAINLY BETWEEN INSIDE CHINA

1138
00:53:30,514 --> 00:53:32,082
AND OUTSIDE OF CHINA, FOR MANY

1139
00:53:32,082 --> 00:53:33,083
DIFFERENT REASONS.

1140
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:33,917
ALIBABA HAS BEEN MORE AGGRESSIVE

1141
00:53:33,917 --> 00:53:38,955
ABOUT TRYING TO OUT -- EXPAND

1142
00:53:38,955 --> 00:53:39,523
OUTSIDE OF CHINA.

1143
00:53:39,523 --> 00:53:40,357
THEY'RE DETERMINED TO GET MORE

1144
00:53:40,357 --> 00:53:41,024
THAN 50% OF THEIR REVENUE

1145
00:53:41,024 --> 00:53:42,859
OUTSIDE OF CHINA EVEN THOUGH

1146
00:53:42,859 --> 00:53:44,795
THERE FAR AWAY FROM THAT RIGHT

1147
00:53:44,795 --> 00:53:46,964
NOW.

1148
00:53:46,964 --> 00:53:53,603
FOR TENCENT, THEY BEEN FOCUSED

1149
00:53:53,603 --> 00:53:54,438
ON CHINA AND THEY'VE BEEN ABLE

1150
00:53:54,438 --> 00:53:55,005
TO DO VERY WELL.

1151
00:53:55,005 --> 00:53:57,674
THEY DID NOT MAKE THE

1152
00:53:57,674 --> 00:53:58,508
ACQUISITION OF SUPER CELL WHICH

1153
00:53:58,508 --> 00:53:59,342
SIGNALS THAT THEY DO HAVE MOBILE

1154
00:53:59,342 --> 00:54:02,179
AMBITIONS.

1155
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:04,214
THEY ARE MAKING LOTS OF

1156
00:54:04,214 --> 00:54:05,048
INVESTMENTS IN SMALL START UP SO

1157
00:54:05,048 --> 00:54:05,782
THEY MAY BE OLD TO DO THAT IN

1158
00:54:05,782 --> 00:54:08,452
THE FUTURE.

1159
00:54:08,452 --> 00:54:09,352
THEY'RE STILL PRIMARILY FOCUSED

1160
00:54:09,352 --> 00:54:13,123
ON THE CHINESE CONSUMER.

1210
01:00:01,871 --> 01:00:02,639
PENNSYLVANIA IS REALLY SEVERAL

1211
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:12,515
DIFFERENT DATES, BUT TWO PRIMARY

1212
01:00:12,515 --> 01:00:13,183
DIVIDES THERE, THE WEST,

1213
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,983
WORKING-CLASS, THERE USED TO BE

1214
01:00:13,983 --> 01:00:15,085
SEAL MILLS, COAL MILLS.

1215
01:00:15,085 --> 01:00:17,520
USED TO BE HEAVILY DEMOCRATIC.

1216
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,321
DONALD TRUMP DOES WELL THERE,

1217
01:00:18,321 --> 01:00:19,022
PROBABLY EVEN BETTER THAN IT

1218
01:00:19,022 --> 01:00:19,456
ROMNEY DID.

1219
01:00:19,456 --> 01:00:24,261
THEN THERE'S THE EAST, BUCKS,

1220
01:00:24,261 --> 01:00:25,028
MONTGOMERY, DELAWARE.

1221
01:00:25,028 --> 01:00:27,997
THOSE FOUR SUBURBAN COUNTIES

1222
01:00:27,997 --> 01:00:32,736
WILL CAST MORE VOTES THAN

1223
01:00:32,736 --> 01:00:33,503
PHILADELPHIA AND PITTSBURGH

1224
01:00:33,503 --> 01:00:34,270
COMBINED AND TRUMP IS GETTING

1225
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:36,006
CLOBBERED IN THOSE SUBURBS.

1226
01:00:36,006 --> 01:00:38,174
THE PLACES HE'S DOING WELL ARE

1227
01:00:38,174 --> 01:00:40,677
PLACES THAT ARE NOT GROWING MUCH

1228
01:00:40,677 --> 01:00:41,511
AS FAR AS VOTERS OR POPULATION.

1229

CLOBBERED ARE TAKING OFF.

1231
01:00:45,181 --> 01:00:47,851

01:00:47,851 --> 01:00:49,552
FOR DONALD TRUMP TO EVEN BE

1233
01:00:49,552 --> 01:00:50,320

1238
01:00:56,292 --> 01:01:01,498
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THEIR FUTURE

1239
01:01:01,498 --> 01:01:02,332
AND WORSE WITH THOSE PEOPLE WHO

1240
01:01:02,332 --> 01:01:03,132
SEEM MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THEIR

1241
01:01:03,132 --> 01:01:03,500

AL: NO QUESTION.

1243
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:07,170
