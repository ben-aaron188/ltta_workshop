1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:01,334
úRESPONSE TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 

2
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:04,838
FINAL STATE OF THE UNION IN 

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,506
2016 IN WHICH SHE WAS VERY 

4
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:10,577
CRITICAL OF THE THEN CANDIDATE 

5
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,145
TRUMP AND HIS RHETORIC, YOU 

6
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,480
KNOW, SLAMMING AGAINST 

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:13,813
DIVISION. 

8
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:15,949
SHE'S OF COURSE THE DAUGHTER OF 

9
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:16,248
IMMIGRANTS. 

10
00:00:16,248 --> 00:00:17,851
SO SHE'S VERY MUCH PLAYED THAT 

11
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:18,017
UP. 

12
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:21,121
AND SO WHEN SHE TOOK THIS JOB 

13
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,989
AS U.N. AMBASSADOR, IT WAS 

14
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,724
SURPRISING TO SOME BECAUSE OF 

15
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:25,758
HER HISTORY WITH TRUMP. 

16
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:26,892
BUT THEY HAD MADE AMENDS AND 

17
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:28,595
SHE HAD BEEN SAYING THAT SHE 

18
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,763
WAS SUPPORTIVE OF HIM WHEN SHE 

19
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:32,497
NEEDED TO BE AND SHE WASN'T 

20
00:00:32,497 --> 00:00:34,934
AFRAID TO ALSO VOICE HER 

21
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:35,468
CRITICISMS OF HIM. 

22
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:36,836
>> SO, CAITLIN, PRESIDENT TRUMP 

23
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:39,105
HAS TWEETED OUT A BIG 

24
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:39,739
ANNOUNCEMENT WITH MY FRIEND 

25
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:40,072
NIKKI HALEY. 

26
00:00:40,072 --> 00:00:43,543
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT TYPE 

27
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,146
OF WORDING, THERE ARE QUESTIONS 

28
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:46,879
SWIRLING WILL SHE BE 

29
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:47,180
REASSIGNED. 

30
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:47,847
SHE DECLINED TO COMMENT WHEN 

31
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:49,849
SHE WAS ASKED THAT BY A REUTERS 

32
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:53,486
REPORTER ON THE WAY INTO THE 

33
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:53,819
WHITE HOUSE. 

34
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:55,889
BUT AS YOU MENTIONED, THEIR 

35
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,056
RELATIONSHIP OVER THE YEARS HAS 

36
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,324
BEEN TUMULTUOUS, AND THEN 

37
00:00:58,324 --> 00:00:58,857
THEY'VE COME TOGETHER. 

38
00:00:58,857 --> 00:01:01,194
SO IT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING 

39
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,063
TO SEE IF SHE IS REASSIGNED OR 

40
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:05,765
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED AT THE 

41
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:06,199
U.N. SO -- 

42
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:06,466
>> RIGHT. 

43
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,867
WELL, IT IS VERY INTERESTING 

44
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:13,206
THAT THEY ARE COMING TO MAKE 

45
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,340
THIS ANNOUNCEMENT TOGETHER IT 

46
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,341
SEEMS PRESENT AT THE WHITE 

47
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,242
HOUSE AS WELL AND THE WHITE 

48
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,877
HOUSE IS CONFIRMING THIS 

49
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,212
INFORMATION AND SAYING THEY'LL 

50
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,281
BE TALKING MORE ABOUT IT IN 

51
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,049
JUST ABOUT 10 MINUTES OR -- 10 

52
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:23,716
MINUTES OR SO. 

53
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:24,717
NIKKI HALEY WAS TALKED ABOUT AS 

54
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,119
A POTENTIAL SECRETARY OF STATE 

55
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,520
JUST GIVEN HER PERCH AT THE 

56
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,254
U.N. AND GIVEN THE EXPERIENCE 

57
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,926
THAT SHE HAS BEEN COLLECTING IN 

58
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:33,226
THAT POST. 

59
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,627
OF COURSE AFTER REX TILLERSON 

60
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:35,795
RESIGNED, THE PRESIDENT CHOSE 

61
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,430
MIKE POMPEO WHO WAS THE FORMER 

62
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:37,664
C.I.A. 

63
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,432
DIRECTOR TO FILL THAT SECRETARY 

64
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,167
OF STATE POST, AND HE AND THE 

65
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,802
PRESIDENT ENJOY A VERY GOOD 

66
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,170
RELATIONSHIP AND THEY'RE ON 

67
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:44,737
GOOD TERMS. 

68
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:46,506
SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO 

69
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,574
SEE WHETHER NIKKI HALEY MIGHT 

70
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:50,410
BE REASSIGNED, HOW THIS 

71
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,211
DECISION WAS REACHED, WHETHER 

72
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:52,112
IN FACT IT WAS MUTUAL. 

73
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,147
WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF 

74
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,148
QUESTIONS GOING INTO THIS. 

75
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,182
THIS IS BIG NEWS, THOUGH, 

76
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:57,450
HOWEVER, BECAUSE WHEN YOU TALK 

77
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,519
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT 

78
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,020
SUPPORTIVE OF THE PRESIDENT BUT 

79
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,254
ARE IN REPUBLICAN POLITICS, 

80
00:02:02,254 --> 00:02:04,757
THEY OFTEN POINT TO NIKKI HALEY 

81
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,759
AS SOMETHING OF A BRIGHT LIGHT. 

82
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,328
THEY POINT TO NIKKI HALEY AND 

83
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,062
JAMES MATTIS, THE DEFENSE 

84
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:11,964
SECRETARY AS KIND OF THE PEOPLE 

85
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:14,100
IN THE ADMINISTRATION WHO ARE 

86
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,135
KIND OF KEEPING A LOT OF THINGS 

87
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:16,969
TOGETHER. 

88
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:19,605
AND SO SHE DOES ENJOY A LOT OF 

89
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:21,074
SUPPORT AND SOME BIPARTISAN 

90
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:21,707
SUPPORT, QUITE FRANKLY. 

91
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:22,609
AND, AGAIN, GIVEN THAT SHE'S 

92
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:23,710
BEEN HERE IN NEW YORK, GIVEN 

93
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,180
THAT SHE HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM 

94
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,581
THE CHAOS IN WASHINGTON AT THE 

95
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,517
U.N., SHE HAS ENJOYED SOME VERY 

96
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,251
POSITIVE RATINGS. 

97
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,586
>> HOW DO YOU THINK SHE WOULD 

98
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:35,088
DO -- I MEAN, PURE SPECULATION 

99
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,123
HERE, IF SHE WAS MOVED TO 

100
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,558
WASHINGTON D.C. AND WORKED MORE 

101
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,392
CLOSELY WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP? 

102
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:40,860
BECAUSE LOOKING AT THEIR 

103
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,527
HISTORY, IT'S BEEN UP AND DOWN. 

104
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:44,063
>> IT HAS BEEN UP AND DOWN. 

105
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,832
REMEMBER A COUPLE OF MOBILITIES 

106
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,167
AGO WHEN THAT ANONYMOUS OP-ED 

107
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:51,070
WAS PUBLISHED IN THE "NEW YORK 

108
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,772
TIMES" FROM A WHITE HOUSE OR 

109
00:02:53,772 --> 00:02:54,507
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL 

110
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,676
CRITICIZING THE PRESIDENT, 

111
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,579
NIKKI HALEY RELEASED HER OWN 

112
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,280
EDITORIAL IN THE "WASHINGTON 

113
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,080
POST" SAYING, YOU KNOW, DENYING 

114
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,615
THAT IT WAS HER AND SAYING IF 

115
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:05,184
SHE DID HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE 

116
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,386
PRESIDENT, SHE EXPRESSES THEM 

117
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,254
TO HIM DIRECTLY AND TO THE 

118
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,222
ADMINISTRATION, AND SHE CALLED 

119
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,490
THAT OP-ED VERY DANGEROUS IN 

120
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,692
TERMS OF WHAT IT WAS DOING, 

121
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,594
THAT "NEW YORK TIMES" OP-ED. 

122
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:17,230
AND SO SHE HAS CARVED OUT HER 

123
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,399
OWN BRAND REALLY IN THIS 

124
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:19,766
ADMINISTRATION. 

125
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,000
NOW, SHE WAS GOVERNOR OF SOUTH 

126
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,667
CAROLINA, A POPULAR GOVERNOR, 

127
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:25,938
AND SHE MADE A LOT OF NEWS IN 

128
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:27,874
2016 FOR CALLING FOR THE 

129
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,043
CONFEDDER AT FLAG TO BE REMOVE 

130
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,179
-- CONFED RAT FLAG TO BE 

131
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,080
REMOVED FROM STATEHOUSE 

132
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,347
GROUNDS. 

133
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,214
THAT WAS A CULTURAL MOMENT IN 

134
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:35,548
THE COUNTRY. 

135
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,515
SHE RECEIVED A LOT OF SUPPORT 

136
00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:38,418
FOR THAT DECISION AND IT WAS A 

137
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,353
RISKY DECISION JUST GIVEN THE 

138
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,254
HISTORY IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 

139
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,923
AND SO SHE KIND OF ROSE -- HAS 

140
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,325
BEEN RISING ON THE NATIONAL 

141
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,695
STAGE, AND SO WE'LL SEE WHAT'S 

142
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:49,062
NEXT FOR HER. 

143
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,129
>> FIRST INDIAN AMERICAN TO 

144
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,131
HOLD OFFICE IN THE STATE OF 

145
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:52,632
SOUTH CAROLINA. 

146
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,901
SHE HAS DEFINITELY MADE HISTORY 

147
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,868
IN HER POLITICAL HISTORY. 

148
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:56,469
SOMETHING THAT'S INTERESTING 

149
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,171
IS, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE LOOK AT 

150
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,740
THE TIMING OF THIS, YESTERDAY 

151
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,974
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT 

152
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:03,176
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND DEPUTY 

153
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,277
ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN 

154
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,978
AND HOW THERE WERE RUMORS 

155
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:07,313
CIRCULATING THAT HE WAS GOING 

156
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,481
TO BE FIRED, AND WE DISCUSSED 

157
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,550
IT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY 

158
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,118
HAVE BEEN ADVISING THE 

159
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:12,752
PRESIDENT, SAYING, HEY, WE'RE 

160
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,221
ONLY 28 DAYS AWAY FROM THE 

161
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:15,888
MIDTERMS, LET'S KEEP EVERYTHING 

162
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,958
SMOOTH SAILING AS WE GO 

163
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,225
FORWARD. 

164
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:21,127
SO THIS A LOT OF REPUBLICANS 

165
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:21,627
ARE SAYING THAT THEY'VE 

166
00:04:21,627 --> 00:04:24,464
RECEIVED THIS ENERGY BOOST AND 

167
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,264
THE BASE HAS BEEN REIGNITED. 

168
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:25,564
>> RIGHT. 

169
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:26,766
>> SO SINCE YOU CALL HER, YOU 

170
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,735
KNOW, A SHINING STAR IN THE 

171
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,670
REPUBLICAN PARTY AND SHE CAN 

172
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,838
CROSS BOTH PARTIES, WOULD THIS 

173
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,239
BE MAYBE A POLITICAL MOVE TO 

174
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,308
JUST KIND OF GET SOME MORE 

175
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,375
ENERGY IF SHE IS REASSIGNED? 

176
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,344
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S A GOOD 

177
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:39,212
QUESTION AND IT ALL REALLY 

178
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,714
DEPENDS ON WHAT HAPPENS NEXT 

179
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,850
FOR HER AND WHAT IS SURROUNDING 

180
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,184
THIS RESIGNATION AND WHAT THAT 

181
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:48,588
RELATIONSHIP IS IN FACT LIKE AS 

182
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:49,555
SHE DEPARTS FROM THE 

183
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,924
ADMINISTRATION AS SHE IS 

184
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:52,925
PLANNING TO DO REPORTEDLY. 

185
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:54,494
SO WHAT'S VERY INTERESTING TO 

186
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:55,427
CONSIDER IS THAT WITH ROD 

187
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:57,930
ROSENSTEIN, IF TRUMP WERE TO 

188
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,600
FIRE HIM, THERE WOULD BE A REAL 

189
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,834
NEGATIVE REACTION, NOT ONLY 

190
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:02,935
AMONG REPUBLICANS AND 

191
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,937
DEMOCRATS, BUT AMONG THE PUBLIC 

192
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,339
BECAUSE IT WOULD SIGNAL A MORE 

193
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,241
CHAOTIC -- SPEAK TO THE MORE 

194
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,909
CHAOTIC ELEMENTS OF THIS 

195
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:10,543
ADMINISTRATION GIVEN THAT 

196
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,044
ROSENSTEIN OVERSEES THE RUSSIA 

197
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:14,113
PROBE AND THAT WOULD INTRODUCE 

198
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:16,949
A WHOLE HOST OF ISSUES FOR THIS 

199
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,884
PRESIDENT BOTH LEGALLY AND IN 

200
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:19,985
TERMS OF POLITICS. 

201
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:21,220
SO WE'RE WAITING TO SEE WHAT 

202
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,723
EXACTLY NIKKI HALEY IS GOING TO 

203
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,192
DO AND WHAT EXACTLY ARE THE 

204
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,261
FACTS SURROUNDING THIS 

205
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,395
RESIGNATION I THINK COULD HELP 

206
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,530
INFORM US ABOUT WHAT KIND OF 

207
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,064
IMPACT THIS COULD HAVE IN THE 

208
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:32,297
FUTURE. 

209
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:35,401
>> WE DO KNOW THAT WE ARE 

210
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:36,335
GETTING CLOSER, WE ARE AWAITING 

211
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:39,238

HALEY WHO HAS RESIGNED. 

216
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:46,479
PRESIDENT TRUMP ACCEPTED HER 

217
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,046
RESIGNATION EARLIER TODAY. 

218
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,981
WE DO KNOW THAT THE PRESS POOL 

219
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,516

00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:53,186
OFFICE AND THAT EVENT IS 

221
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,353
EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE AT

WE'RE TALKING WITH OUR CBSN 

228
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,833
POLITICAL REPORTER CAITLIN HUEY 

229
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,135
BURNS WHO'S BEEN COVERING THIS

ADMINISTRATION, AND, YOU KNOW, 

231
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,604
LOOKING AT NIKKI HALEY, WE KNOW 

232
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:12,538
THERE'S A LOT OF POSITIVE 

233
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,574
ATTRIBUTES  THAT WE HAVE TALKED 

234
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:14,807
ABOUT. 

235
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,976
HAS SHE BEEN UNDER THE 

236
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,644
MICROSCOPE FOR ANYTHING ELSE 

237
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,379
THAT HAS BEEN SWIRLING AROUND? 

238
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,181
>> WELL, SHE HAS BEEN UN -- 

239
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,083
UNLIKE THE PRESIDENT, SHE'S 

240
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,185
BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF RUSSIA. 

241
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,321
SHE'S ALSO BEEN VERY OUTSPOKEN 

242
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,156
WHEN SHE DOES DISAGREE WITH THE 

243
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,058
ADMINISTRATION ON THE WAY 

244
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,259
FORWARD WHEN IT COMES TO 

245
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,994
FOREIGN POLICY AND SHE'S 

246
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,763
REALLY, AGAIN, CARVED OUT AN 

247
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:39,832
IDENTITY FOR HERSELF KIND OF 

248
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,634
SEPARATE OF THE TRUMP WHITE 

249
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:42,769
HOUSE WHICH HAS BEEN KIND OF 

250
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,971
HOW SHE HAS BEEN ABLE TO 

251
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:47,874
SUCCEED REALLY AND KIND OF 

252
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:48,407
GARNER POSITIVE SUPPORT. 

253
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,144
THERE ARE QUESTIONS I WOULD 

254
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,879
IMAGINE ABOUT THAT RELATIONSHIP 

255
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,814
ABOUT THOSE DIFFERENCES AS IT 

256
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,282
RED LIGHTS -- RELATES TO THIS 

257
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:56,482
POST. 

258
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:57,517
REMEMBER, THE PRESIDENT WAS 

259
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,285
JUST HERE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO 

260
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,820
SPEAKING TO THE U.N. GENERAL 

261
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,721
ASSEMBLY, AND THAT'S REALLY 

262
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:02,688
NIKKI HALEY'S BREAD AND BUTTER 

263
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,424
OF COURSE GIVEN HER POST AT THE 

264
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,193
U.N. SO I AM WONDERING IF THERE 

265
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,228
HAD BEEN CONVERSATIONS THEN, IF 

266
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,863
THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT 

267
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,632
THEIR DIFFERENCES AS IT RELATES 

268
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,034
TO FOREIGN POLICY, ESPECIALLY 

269
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,770
AS THE PRESIDENT PREPARES TO 

270
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,540
CONTINUE THIS OPEN RELATIONSHIP 

271
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,273
AND DIALOGUE WITH NORTH KOREA. 

272
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:24,043
POMPEO OF COURSE JUST MEETING 

273
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,177
WITH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG-UN 

274
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:27,613
JUST THIS WEEK AND RETURNING 

275
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:28,581
FROM THAT TRIP. 

276
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,250
SO KEEPING AN EYE ON WHETHER 

277
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,084
THIS IS ABOUT THOSE 

278
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:32,952
DIFFERENCES, WHETHER THEY ARE 

279
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,955
NOT ABLE TO GET ON THE SAME 

280
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,658
PAGE OR WHETHER SHE IS BEING 

281
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:39,992
MOVED TO ANOTHER POSITION OR 

282
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:44,096
WHETHER THIS WAS A SPLIT THAT 

283
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,130
WAS MUTUALLY AGREED UPON. 

284
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,165
>> SO MANY QUESTIONS. 

285
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:46,866
FASCINATING TO WATCH AND WAIT, 

286
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,335
YOU KNOW, TO HEAR EXACTLY WHAT 

287
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:49,668
IS HAPPENING. 

288
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:51,037
BUT WE DO KNOW THAT PRESIDENT 

289
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,505
TRUMP TWEETED OUT BIG 

290
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,140
ANNOUNCEMENT WITH MY FRIEND, 

291
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,974
AND I THINK THAT'S INTERESTING 

292
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,143
WORDING THERE BECAUSE THERE'S 

293
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,979
ALWAYS SPECULATION THAT MAYBE 

294
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,746
SOMETHING WENT WRONG. 

295
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:01,347
BUT, AGAIN, BIG ANNOUNCEMENT 

296
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:02,415
WITH MY FRIEND AMBASSADOR NIKKI 

297
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,617
HALEY IN THE OVAL OFFICE AT 

298
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:04,917
10:30 A.M. 

299
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:05,885
WE'RE JUST ABOUT A MINUTE AND A 

300
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:06,352
HALF AWAY FROM THAT. 

301
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,320
WE DO KNOW THAT THE PRESS POOL 

302
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,789
HAS GATHERED IN THE OVAL OFFICE 

303
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,826
TO HEAR FROM BOTH OF THEM. 

304
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:14,727
THERE HAS BEEN SPECULATION THAT 

305
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:17,229
MAYBE NIKKI HALEY HAS BEEN 

306
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:17,529
REASSIGNED. 

307
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:19,765
SHE DECLINED TO COMMENT AS SHE 

308
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:20,866
WALKED INTO THE OVAL OFFICE. 

309
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:22,568
YOU KNOW, CAITLIN, WHAT DOES 

310
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,270
HISTORY SHOW US IN TERMS OF A 

311
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,539
U.S. AMBASSADOR POST, HOW LONG 

312
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,473
DO THEY TYPICALLY STAY? 

313
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,507
DO THEY STAY THE WHOLE TERM? 

314
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,942
>> WELL, IT IS AN INTERESTING 

315
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,010
POSITION BECAUSE, AGAIN, YOU'RE 

316
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,378
NOT IN WASHINGTON, YOU'RE HERE 

317
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:35,114
IN NEW YORK. 

318
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,716
SO THAT GIVES YOU SOME KIND OF 

319
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,150
AUTONOMY AND IT IS A CHANCE FOR 

320
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,587
SOMEONE LIKE NIKKI HALEY WHO 

321
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:45,524
WAS COMING AS A GOVERNOR WAS 

322
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:47,026
VERY A LONG-TIME POLITICAL 

323
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,962
FIGURE, NOW THIS POSITION HAS 

324
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,163
ALLOWED HER TO ACCUMULATE 

325
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:52,365
FOREIGN POLICY EXPERIENCE AND 

326
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,668
EXPERIENCE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE 

327
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,570
NOT OTHERWISE HAD AS GOVERNOR 

328
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,203
OF SOUTH CAROLINA. 

329
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:00,706
SO IT'S SEEN IN SOME WAYS AS 

330
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,441
PERHAPS A LAUNCHING PAD FOR 

331
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,343
HIGHER OFFICE WHICH IS LOTS OF 

332
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:06,178
FOLKS KIND OF SPECULATED AT THE 

333
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,081
BEGINNING THAT SHE HAD HER EYES 

334
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,584
ON BIGGER AMBITIONS BEYOND THE 

335
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:14,954
U.N. IT CAN BE REALLY A 

336
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,155
LAUNCHING PAD FOR HIGHER OFFICE 

337
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,923
IF SHE INDEED CHOSE TO DO SO. 

338
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:21,093
THERE WAS SPECULATION OF COURSE 

339
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,663
LAST YEAR WHEN THE PRESIDENT 

340
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,197
WAS FEUDING WITH REX TILLERSON 

341
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:25,998
PRIVATELY THAT NIKKI HALEY 

342
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:26,999
WOULD BE SOMEONE WHO WOULD 

343
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:28,267
ASSUME THAT ROLE AND THAT THAT 

344
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:32,905
MIGHT GIVE HER A BIGGER 

345
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,172
PLATFORM. 

346
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:34,674
HE OF COURSE CHOSE MIKE POMPEO, 

347
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:35,875
THE FORMER C.I.A. 

348
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,243
DIRECTOR WHO HAS A GREAT 

349
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,577
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT 

350
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:40,379
AND THE PRESIDENT SPEAKS VERY 

351
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:40,746
HIGHLY OF HIM. 

352
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:41,847
YOU DO KNOW THAT LANGUAGE, 

353
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,516
THOUGH, THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 

354
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,984
BEEN USING TO DESCRIBE NIKKI 

355
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,419
HALEY AS MY FRIEND, THE FACT 

356
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,221
THAT THIS IS KIND OF SEEMING TO 

357
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,691
BE A FORMAL ROLLOUT FIRST 

358
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,192
REPORTED BY AXIOS AND NOW 

359
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:54,860
CONFIRMED, THE WHITE HOUSE 

360
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,096
EXPECTED TO TALK IN A COUPLE OF 

361
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,165
MINUTES HERE AND EXPLAIN MORE 

362
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,333
ABOUT THE DECISION MAKING 

363
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:01,600
PROCESS. 

364
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,000
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 

365
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,903
IT IS 10:30 EASTERN STANDARD 

366
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,504
TIME, AND WE ARE AWAITING AN 

367
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,340

369
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,278
U.N. AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY WHO 

370
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,714
HAS RESIGNED, REALLY SENDING 

371
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:15,381
SHOCKWAVES THROUGHOUT THE 

372
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:15,981
POLITICAL WORLD THIS MORNING. 

373
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:18,818
IT DOESN'T SEEM AS IF THAT WAS 

374
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:19,919
EXPECTED AT ALL. 

375
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,088
CAITLIN, YOU MENTIONED THAT SHE 

376
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,823
JUST RECENTLY WROTE THAT 

377
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:24,423
REBUTTAL TO THE ANONYMOUS OP-

378
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:27,393
ED, AND I JUST WANT TO READ A 

379
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,096
LITTLE BIT OF THAT AS WE ARE 

380
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,464
WAITING FOR THIS ANNOUNCEMENT 

381
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,731
FROM THE OVAL OFFICE. 

382
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:33,833
AND NIKKI HALEY WROTE IN THERE 

383
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,101
THAT THE AUTHOR MIGHT THINK HE 

384
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,838
OR SHE IS DOING A SERVICE TO 

385
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:39,171
THE COUNTRY. 

386
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:39,638
I STRONGLY DISAGREE. 

387
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:40,573
WHAT THIS SENIOR OFFICIAL IN 

388
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:41,641
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS 

389
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,310
DONE AND IS APPARENTLY INTENT 

390
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,010
ON CONTINUING TO DO IS A 

391
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:46,379
SERIOUS DISSERVICE NOT JUST TO 

392
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,813
THE PRESIDENT, BUT TO THE 

393
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,547
COUNTRY. 

394
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,183
SHE WENT OBJECT TO -- WENT ON 

395
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,520
TO WRITE I TOO AM A SENIOR 

396
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,289
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL, 

397
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,258
I SERVE IN THIS ADMINISTRATION 

398
00:10:59,258 --> 00:10:59,892
AND I ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT 

399
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,761
THE DECISIONS IN WHICH HE IS 

400
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,228
TAKING THE COUNTRY. 

401
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:02,862
READING THAT, THAT SEEMS LIKE 

402
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,097
WE WERE GOING TO BE THE LAST 

403
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:07,032
THING WE WOULD BE DISCUSSING 

404
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:07,265
TODAY. 

405
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:07,666
>> EXACTLY. 

406
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,400
WHAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING 

407
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,602
ABOUT WHEN THAT "NEW YORK 

408
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:10,803
TIMES" OP-ED CAME OUT, EVERYONE 

409
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:11,971
IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND EVERYONE 

410
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,105
OUTSIDE OF IT WAS PLAYING THE 

411
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:14,240
SPECULATION GAME, TRYING TO 

412
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,777
FIND WHO WAS THE WRITER OF THAT 

413
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:18,010
OP-ED. 

414
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,611
YOU HAD MANY ADMINISTRATION 

415
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,746
OFFICIALS, INCLUDING THE VICE 

416
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:24,316
PRESIDENT HAVE TO COME OUT AND 

417
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:25,083
SAY THAT IT WASN'T THEM. 

418
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:28,487
AND SO NIKKI HALEY'S REBUTTAL, 

419
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:29,388
THAT PUBLISHED REBUTTAL WAS 

420
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,456
REALLY REMARKABLE AND MAKING 

421
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,590
CLEAR -- SHE WAS TRYING TO MAKE 

422
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,292
CLEAR THAT IT WASN'T HER AND 

423
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,394
SHE SAID THAT WHILE SHE DOES 

424
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,929
HAVE SERIOUS DISAGREEMENTS WITH 

425
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,864
THE PRESIDENT, SHE VOICES THEM 

426
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,100
TO HIM DIRECTLY, AND SHE CALLED 

427
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,903
THAT "NEW YORK TIMES" OP-ED 

428
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,538
SOMETHING OF A DANGEROUS 

429
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,772
ENDEAVOR TO GO DOWN THAT ROUTE. 

430
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:47,673
WHAT IS VERY INTERESTING, 

431
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:51,143
THOUGH, IS THAT A LOT OF 

432
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:51,810
REPUBLICANS HAVE HAD THEIR EYE 

433
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,279
ON NIKKI HALEY BEFORE DONALD 

434
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,148
TRUMP KIND OF CAME INTO FORE, 

435
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,618
SHE WAS CONSIDERED A POTENTIAL 

436
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:00,486
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE HERSELF. 

437
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,088
HER ENDORSEMENT IN THE 2016 

438
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,756
PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY ON THE 

439
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,624
REPUBLICAN SIDE WAS AMONG THE 

440
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:09,195
MOST COVETED BECAUSE SHE DID 

441
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,397
KIND OF REPRESENT THAT NEW 

442
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:11,997
REPRESENT BRAND THAT MORE 

443
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,933
INCLUSIVE AND DIVERSE 

444
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:14,867
REPUBLICAN BRAND THAT THE PARTY 

445
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,103
WAS SELLING OF COURSE BEFORE 

446
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,571
2016 OR TRYING TO SELL. 

447
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,239
SHE ENDORSED MARCO RUBIO IN 

448
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,775
SOUTH CAROLINA, AND THAT WAS 

449
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:23,776
CONSIDERED SOMETHING OF A 

450
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:24,576
LAUNCHING POINT FOR HIM. 

451
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:26,111
BUT WE KNOW HOW THAT TURNED 

452
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:26,311
OUT. 

453
00:12:26,311 --> 00:12:29,081
THE PARTY DECIDED TO GO THE 

454
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:29,849
OTHER WAY. 

455
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,383
HALEY HAD BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF 

456
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:34,487
DONALD TRUMP AND HIS RHETORIC 

457
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,588
THROUGHOUT THE 2016 CAMPAIGN. 

458
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,355
THEY MADE AMENDS AFTER HIS 

459
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,824
ELECTION AND OF COURSE SHE WAS 

460
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,226
APPOINTED TO THIS POST. 

461
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,762
AND THIS POST WAS SEEN AS A 

462
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,164
REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR HER NOT 

463
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,399
ONLY TO ACCRUE FOREIGN POLICY 

464
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,601
EXPERIENCE AND MORE EXPERIENCE 

465
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,836
ON KIND OF A NATIONAL STAGE AND 

466
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,238
ALSO PERHAPS GIVING HER A 

467
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,673
PLATFORM FOR A PRESIDENTIAL RUN 

468
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,176
DOWN THE ROAD OR SOME HIGHER 

469
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,844
OFFICE IN ADDITION TO HER 

470
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,012
EXPERIENCE AS TWO TERMS AS 

471
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:00,879
SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR. 

472
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:05,885
>> YOU BRING UP A FASCINATING 

473
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:06,118
POINT. 

474
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,486
HER AMBITION FOR HIGHER OFFICE. 

475
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:09,455
WE HAVE SEEN DIFFERENT HINTS AT 

476
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:09,655
THAT. 

477
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,858
HOW WOULD YOU SEE THAT PLAYING 

478
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,927
OUT AND WOULD YOU EXPECT HER TO 

479
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,428
CHALLENGE PRESIDENT TRUMP GOING 

480
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,229
FORWARD OR, YOU KNOW, HOW WOULD 

481
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,063
THAT PLAY OUT? 

482
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,366
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF NEVER 

483
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,300
TRUMPERS AS WE CALL THEM. 

484
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:21,567
>> RIGHT. 

485
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,570
>> WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME 

486
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,170
KIND OF CHALLENGE. 

487
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,038
YOU KNOW, ON PAPER IT WOULD 

488
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,374
SEEM THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD 

489
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:32,311
BE RIPE FOR AN INTER-PARTY 

490
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,078
CHALLENGE GIVEN HIS 

491
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:33,612
UNPOPULARITY NATIONALLY. 

492
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:36,115
BUT HE IS VERY POPULAR AMONG 

493
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,883
REPUBLICANS AND STILL REMAINS 

494
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:38,150
SO. 

495
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,185
AND ANY CHALLENGE AMONG 

496
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,419
REPUBLICANS WOULD REALLY BE IN 

497
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,520
VAIN AT THIS POINT. 

498
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,589
AND SO IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER 

499
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:44,790
SHE WOULD WAGE THAT, ALTHOUGH 

500
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,625
LOTS OF FOLKS IN THE REPUBLICAN 

501
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,127
PARTY WHO DO NOT LIKE TRUMP DO 

502
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,229
NOT LIKE HIS STYLE POINT TO HER 

503
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,797
AS A BRIGHT SPOT IN THE 

504
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:52,931
ADMINISTRATION AND THE FACT 

505
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:54,867
THAT SHE HAS STAYED FROM THE 

506
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,936
BEGINNING WHEN WE'VE SEEN SO 

507
00:13:57,936 --> 00:14:00,439
MANY DEPARTURES IN THIS WHITE 

508
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,341
HOUSE, HER STAYING IN THAT 

509
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,642
POSITION WAS PRETTY MUCH AN 

510
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:04,743
ANOMALY, I MEAN, HER, JAMES 

511
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,345
MATTIS, OF COURSE THE SECRETARY 

512
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,381
OF DEFENSE IS STILL THERE AND A 

513
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:10,082
COUPLE OF OTHERS. 

514
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,117
BUT WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY 

515
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:15,287
DEPARTURES IN THIS WHITE HOUSE. 

516
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,223
NOW, WE ARE APPROACHING A 

517
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,391
MIDTERM AND THERE -- TYPICALLY 

518
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,660
IN ADMINISTRATIONS PEOPLE START 

519
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,394
TO RE-EVALUATE THEIR POSITIONS. 

520
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,094
IT REALLY DEPENDS. 

521
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:25,731
WE'LL SEE WHETHER THE PRESIDENT 

522
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:26,231
FACES SERIOUS POLITICAL 

523
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:27,599
CONSEQUENCES IN NOVEMBER FOR 

524
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:29,969
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HE HAS 

525
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:30,336
DONE AND SAID. 

526
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,371
WE ARE STILL KIND OF KEEPING AN 

527
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,172
EYE ON THAT. 

528
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,941
BUT THIS IS REALLY BIG NEWS 

529
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:37,576
COMING FROM WASHINGTON JUST 

530
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:40,145
GIVEN THAT WE HAVE BEEN

00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:41,213
WATCHING HER REALLY COME INTO 

532
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,548

533
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,350
HERSELF AND CARVE OUT HER OWN 

534
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,083
IDENTITY IN THIS POST.

00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:14,146
ANNOUNCEMENT WITH MY FRIEND 

552
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,548
U.N. AMBASADOR NIKKI HALEY AT 

553
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,183
10:30 OUT OF THE OVAL OFFICE. 

554
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,651
AGAIN, AS CAITLIN HUEY BURNS IS 

555
00:15:19,651 --> 00:15:21,820
REPORTING RIGHT NOW, THIS IS 

556
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,156
BIG NEWS COMING OUT OF 

557
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,592
WASHINGTON, A LOT OF UNANSWERED 

558
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,559
QUESTIONS, HAS SHE BEEN 

559
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,496
REASSIGNED, WAS SHE ASKED TO 

560
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:31,730
RESIGN, DID THIS TAKE THE 

561
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,965
PRESIDENT OFF GUARD, WHEN DID 

562
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,867
SHE MAKE THIS DECISION, SO MANY 

563
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:35,367
UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. 

564
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,835
WE DO KNOW THAT THE PRESS POOL 

565
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,070
IS WAITING IN THE OVAL OFFICE 

566
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,907
READY TO ANSWER SO MANY OF 

567
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:42,307
THOSE QUESTIONS. 

568
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:42,908
CAITLIN, JUST LOOKING AT 

569
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:43,642
POSSIBLE REPLACEMENTS, YOU 

570
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,711
KNOW, WHO WOULD COME UP IN YOUR 

571
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:45,911
MIND? 

572
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,579
>> IT'S A GOOD QUESTION, 

573
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:48,714
ESPECIALLY HOW CRITICAL THIS 

574
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:49,214
ROLE HAS BEEN. 

575
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,582
REMEMBER JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO 

576
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:54,853
THE PRESIDENT WAS IN NEW YORK 

577
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,688
FOR THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL 

578
00:15:56,688 --> 00:15:58,123
ASSEMBLY, AND NIKKI HALEY HAS 

579
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,191
BEEN KIND OF AT THE FOREFRONT 

580
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:00,659
OF THAT OF COURSE GIVEN THIS 

581
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:00,892
ROLE. 

582
00:16:00,892 --> 00:16:03,729
SO THERE IS A BIG QUESTION 

583
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,664
ABOUT WHO WOULD FILL THAT 

584
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:06,865
POSITION, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE 

585
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,700
ITEMS AT HAND, NORTH KOREA OF 

586
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,469
COURSE BEING FRONT AND CENTER 

587
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,203
AT THIS POINT. 

588
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,571
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE TOO 

589
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,907
IS, YOU KNOW, WHETHER SHE IS IN 

590
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:18,143
FACT REASSIGNED OR WHETHER SHE 

591
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,177
IS LEAVING, WHETHER SHE BECOMES 

592
00:16:19,177 --> 00:16:20,312
ACTIVE ON THE MIDTERM CAMPAIGN 

593
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:24,717
TRAIL GIVEN THAT SHE IS -- YOU 

594
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:28,187
KNOW, IF SHE'S NOT REASSIGNED 

595
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,988
THAT SHE COULD BE FREE TO DO 

596
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:30,188
THAT. 

597
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:33,192
OF COURSE SHE IS REALLY BELOVED 

598
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:34,226
BY REPUBLICAN, SHE AND LINDSAY 

599
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,159
GRAHAM SENATOR FROM SOUTH 

600
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:35,961
CAROLINA ARE REALLY CLOSE BEING 

601
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,597
THAT THEY SHARE A HOME STATE 

602
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:39,097
AND HAVE WORKED CLOSELY 

603
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:40,499
TOGETHER, OF COURSE GRAHAM 

604
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,167
BEING A KEY ALLY OF THE 

605
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:42,934
PRESIDENT HAS EMERGED AS HIS 

606
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:46,271
TOP ALLY IN THE SENATE AT THIS 

607
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:46,504
POINT. 

608
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:48,173
SO I'M VERY INTERESTED TO SEE 

609
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,142
THE WAY IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT 

610
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,878
VIEWS THIS AND HOW THEY CAME TO 

611
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:53,245
THIS DECISION. 

612
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,613
>> WELL, AS WE WAIT FOR THIS 

613
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:55,213

00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,050
NIKKI HALEY, WE WANT TO BRING 

616
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,351
IN OUR CBS NEWS STATE 

617
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,352
DEPARTMENT REPORTER KYLIE

MINUTES SINCE THIS NEWS BROKE. 

625
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:13,799

AIDES ARE ANSWERING THE PHONE. 

627
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,335
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I 

628
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:17,268
THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO 

629
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:20,038
NOTE IS THAT THOUGH NIKKI HALEY 

630
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,239
CAME IN AND HAS BEEN A 

631
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:21,906
CONSISTENT SUPPORTER OF 

632
00:17:21,906 --> 00:17:23,142
PRESIDENT TRUMP THROUGHOUT, A 

633
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,076
LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT I'M 

634
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,444
CALLING TODAY ARE FOLKS THAT 

635
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:28,614
HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH NIKKI 

636
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,816
HALEY SINCE SHE WAS THE 

637
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:31,917
GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA. 

638
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,052
HER TOP POLICY PERSON WHO'S 

639
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,920
BASED HERE IN WASHINGTON D.C. 

640
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,321
WAS A POLLSTER WITH HER WORKING 

641
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,055
IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 

642
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:39,558
A LOT OF HER TOP AIDES WHO HAVE 

643
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,826
BEEN WORKING WITH HER AT THE 

644
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,861

WITH HER FROM SOUTH CAROLINA AS 

646
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:45,197
WELL. 

647
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,432
SO EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS A BIG 

648
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:48,867
PART OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, 

649
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,869
SHE DEFINITELY HAD HER OWN 

650
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:51,637
LITTLE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT 

651
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:53,472
WERE VERY CLOSE TO HER, AND IT 

652
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:57,176
WAS HARD TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS 

653
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,411
HAPPENING WITHIN THE SMALLNESS 

654
00:17:59,411 --> 00:17:59,778
OF THAT GROUP. 

655
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,181

00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,788
WE'RE A LITTLE PAST THIS RIGHT 

661
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:09,988
NOW. 

662
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,123
KYLIE ATWOOD IS FOLLOWING THIS 

663
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:11,990
STORY FOR US OUT OF STATE 

664
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,958
DEPARTMENT AND CAITLIN HUEY

BURNS IS HERE ON SET WITH ME, A 

666
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,028
CBSN POLITICAL REPORTER. 

667
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:18,263
WE'RE ALSO JUST LOOKING UP 

668
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,065
NIKKI HALEY WAS ON "FACE THE 

669
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,901
NATION" ON SEPTEMBER 23rd, AND 

670
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,870
JUST KIND OF LOOKING OVER HER 

671
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,604
TRANSCRIPT HERE, CAITLIN, RIGHT 

672
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,439
NOW, I'M JUST LOOKING TO SEE IF 

673
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,441
THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT MIGHT 

674
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,842
HAVE HINTED AT THIS. 

675
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:33,111
YOU KNOW, SHE DISCUSSED WITH 

676
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:34,045
JOHN DICKERSON DIFFERENT 

677
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:34,279
TOPICS. 

678
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,648
AND AS I GO THROUGH THIS AND 

679
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:38,183
JUST LOOK AT THIS TRANSCRIPT, 

680
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:41,086
JUST GO OVER THE RELATIONSHIP 

681
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,854
AND THE HISTORY WITH PRESIDENT 

682
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:44,423
TRUMP, IT'S BEEN ON AGAIN, OFF 

683
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,925
AGAIN AND HOW THEY'VE COME 

684
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,894
TOGETHER? 

685
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,362
>> YES, IT HAS BEEN AN ON-AGAIN-

686
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:50,862
OFF-AGAIN RELATIONSHIP. 

687
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:54,099
IN 2016 SHE WAS A KEY CRITIC OF 

688
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:54,299
HIM. 

689
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,235
SHE WAS AN ALLY OF JEB BUSH 

690
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,770
GIVEN THAT THEY BOTH SERVED AS 

691
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,104
GOVERNOR. 

692
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,572
SHE SPOKE WITH HIM. 

693
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,440
SHE ENDED UP ENDORSING MARCO 

694
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,008
RUBIO, THE FLORIDA SENATOR IN 

695
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,376
THAT REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, THAT 

696
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,177
VERY CROWDED REPUBLICAN 

697
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:05,444
PRIMARY. 

698
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,378
AND WHEN SHE GAVE THAT 

699
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,514
ENDORSEMENT, IT WAS SEEN AS A 

700
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:12,651
BIG BOOST IN SOUTH CAROLINA TO 

701
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:12,884
RUBIO. 

702
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:14,619
OF COURSE TRUMP ENDED UP TAKING 

703
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:14,919
THAT STATE. 

704
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:17,189
BUT WHAT WAS VERY INTERESTING 

705
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,157
ABOUT HALEY WAS THAT SHE WASN'T 

706
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:22,628
-- AT THE TIME WASN'T AFRAID TO 

707
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,763
BE CRITICAL OF THEN CANDIDATE 

708
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:24,996
TRUMP. 

709
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:25,897
SHE CRITICIZED HIS RHETORIC, 

710
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:28,667
SHE GAVE A RESPONSE, SHE WAS 

711
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,803
TAPPED BY REPUBLICANS TO GIVE A 

712
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:32,370
RESPONSE TO THEN PRESIDENT 

713
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,806
OBAMA'S FINAL STATE OF THE 

714
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:39,778
UNION IN 2016 AND SHE REALLY 

715
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:40,912
EVOKED HER IMMIGRANT HISTORY, 

716
00:19:40,912 --> 00:19:41,512
HER PARENTS OF COURSE. 

717
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:42,347
SHE REALLY WAS CRITICAL WITHOUT 

718
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,982
NAMING TRUMP OF THE RHETORIC 

719
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,251
THAT HE WAS ESPOUSING AND SHE 

720
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,886
TRIED TO STRIKE A MORE 

721
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,321
CONTILLTORY TONE AND A MORE 

722
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,622
INCLUSIVE TONE IN THAT SPEECH. 

723
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:51,890
AND THAT WAS SOMETHING -- IN 

724
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,091
THAT REBUTTAL, AND THAT WAS 

725
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,793
SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF FOLKS 

726
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:58,830
HAD THEIR EYE ON AT THE TIME. 

727
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,099
OF COURSE TRUMP WON THE 

728
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,535
NOMINATION, WON THE ELECTION 

729
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,536
AND HALEY JOINED HIS 

730
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:04,903
ADMINISTRATION. 

731
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,471
SHE HAS SINCE SAID AND KYLIE 

732
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,973
CAN SPEAK TO THIS MORE 

733
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:11,543
DIRECTLY, SHE HAS SAID IN THAT 

734
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,611
"WASHINGTON POST" OP-ED THAT 

735
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,746
SHE IS -- OPPOSES THE PRESIDENT 

736
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,348
OR VOICES HER CONCERNS WHEN SHE 

737
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:22,621
NEEDS TO AND JOINS HIM WHEN SHE 

738
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,188
FEELS THAT IS CORRECT. 

739
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,823
SHE HAS BEEN INOCULATED IN SOME 

740
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,191
RESPECTS FROM THE DRAMA GOING 

741
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,326
ON IN WASHINGTON GIVEN HER 

742
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,894
PERCH HERE IN NEW YORK, AND 

743
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,395
THAT HAS HELPED I THINK -- HAS 

744
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,264
HELPED HER IN THIS POSITION, 

745
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:35,400
BUT ALSO SHE IS STILL VERY 

746
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,301
POPULAR AMONG THE GENERAL 

747
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,570
PUBLIC WHEN MANY FOLKS 

748
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,404
ASSOCIATED WITH THE 

749
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:39,937
ADMINISTRATION ARE NOT. 

750
00:20:39,937 --> 00:20:44,509
>> KYLIE, WEIGH IN ON THAT AS 

751
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:44,709
WELL. 

752
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:45,143
>>REPORTER:  YEAH. 

753
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,378
I MEAN, HALEY THROUGH AND 

754
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:47,980
THROUGH HAS BEEN THE ONE WHO 

755
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,049
SAID WHEN SHE HAS PROBLEMS WITH 

756
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,351
THE PRESIDENT, SHE TAKES HIM ON 

757
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,618
DIRECTLY. 

758
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,853
SO SHE HAS BEEN AN ADVOCATE FOR 

759
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,089
A LOT OF HIS POLICIES, AND WHEN 

760
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,390
SHE DOESN'T AGREE, SHE MARCHS 

761
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,759
INTO THE WHITE HOUSE TO THE 

762
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:01,760
OVAL OFFICE TO TELL HIM THAT. 

763
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,596
A FEW THINGS THAT SHE HAS BEEN 

764
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,965
AN ADVOCATE FOR WITH THIS 

765
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,201
ADMINISTRATION, NUMBER ONE WAS 

766
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,602
MOVING THE EMBASSY FROM TEL 

767
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,436
AVIV TO JERUSALEM IN ISRAEL. 

768
00:21:12,436 --> 00:21:14,272
SHE WAS A BIG PROPONENT OF 

769
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:14,472
THAT. 

770
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:15,072
AND SINCE THAT HAS HAPPENED, 

771
00:21:15,072 --> 00:21:17,943
SHE HAS BEEN THE ONE TO FACE 

772
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,113
THE BLOWBACK ON THE WORLD STAGE 

773
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:21,680
AT THE U.N. BECAUSE MOST 

774
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,148
COUNTRIES DIDN'T AGREE WITH THE 

775
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,149
U.S. IN THAT DECISION. 

776
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,151
AND SHE HAS ALSO BEEN THE ONE 

777
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:27,219
TO TAKE THAT A BIT PERSONALLY. 

778
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,421
MUCH LIKE THE PRESIDENT, SOME 

779
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,590
OF THE CRITICISM THAT SHE 

780
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,592
RECEIVES GOES DEEP WITH HER. 

781
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,895
AND SO AS WE HAVE SEEN THIS 

782
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,630
ADMINISTRATION PULL BACK ITS 

783
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,965
AIDE FROM U.N.R.A. 

784
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,567
WHICH IS A U.N. ORGANIZATION 

785
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:43,535
THAT PROVIDES SUPPORT TO 

786
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:44,135
PALESTINIAN REFUGEES, THAT'S 

787
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:48,040
SOMETHING THAT NIKKI HALEY WAS 

788
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,940
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF BECAUSE THE 

789
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,143
PALESTINIANS TREATED THE U.S. 

790
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,412
WITH SUCH FRUSTRATION, WITH 

791
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,013
SUCH ANGER AFTER THEY MOVED THE 

792
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:55,413
ISRAEL EMBASSY. 

793
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:57,115
>> AND SO THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT 

794
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,251
OF THESE ISSUES WHERE, YOU 

795
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,752
KNOW, HALEY HAS BEEN THE 

796
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:01,586
LEADING VOICE AND SHE'S NOT 

797
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:03,889
AFRAID TO GET OUT THERE AND BE 

798
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:04,623
VOCAL ABOUT IT. 

799
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:08,126
SHE ACTUALLY WAS THE ONE AT ONE 

800
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:08,927
POINT WHO PRESCRIBED -- SAID 

801
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:11,863
THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 

802
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:12,998
WAS GOING TO BE PUTTING NEW 

803
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,766
SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA, AND THEN 

804
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,034
THEY DIDN'T DO IT. 

805
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,268
AND SHE SAID I WASN'T WRONG. 

806
00:22:17,268 --> 00:22:19,504
THIS WAS A POINT OF CONFLICT IN 

807
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,239
THE WHITE HOUSE, THERE WAS SOME 

808
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:21,739
CONFUSION THERE. 

809
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:23,842
BUT I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT I WAS 

810
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,075
DOING. 

811
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:26,545
THIS IS NOT SOMEONE WHO HAS 

812
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,113
EVER STEPPED BACK FROM WHAT SHE 

813
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,449
BELIEVES IS RIGHT AND FROM THE 

814
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:31,282
POLICIES THAT SHE'S ADVOCATING 

815
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:31,482
FOR. 

816
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:35,020
I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT 

817
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,754
SHE HAD A VERY FROSTY 

818
00:22:36,754 --> 00:22:38,857
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FIRST 

819
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,690
SECRETARY OF STATE REX 

820
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,625
TILLERSON. 

821
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,127
THEY DID NOT GET ALONG. 

822
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,029
SHE WOULD COME TO WASHINGTON, 

823
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,664
SHE WOULDN'T EVEN TELL REX 

824
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:47,232
TILLERSON'S STAFF THAT SHE WAS 

825
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:47,432
HERE. 

826
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,234
IT WAS SORT OF LIKE THEY HAD 

827
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:50,969
THIS COMPETITION FOR POWER, WHO 

828
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:54,372
WAS THE ONE WHO WAS THE LEADING 

829
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,507
VOICE FOR FOREIGN POLICY FOR 

830
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:56,141
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. 

831
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:59,244
AND SHE FELT THAT SHE HAD A 

832
00:22:59,244 --> 00:22:59,978
CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH TRUMP. 

833
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,713
TILLERSON DIDN'T SEE A NEED TO 

834
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,648
REALLY DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP 

835
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:04,215
WITH NIKKI HALEY. 

836
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:05,250
>> KYLIE, LET ME JUST INTERRUPT 

837
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,785
YOU JUST FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE 

838
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:08,153
WE'RE JUST GETTING -- WE'RE 

839
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,220
STARTING TO GET SOME REPORTS 

840
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,890
FROM A POOL REPORTER IN THE 

841
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,624
OVAL OFFICE, AND WE'RE TOLD 

842
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:14,893
THAT MR. TRUMP SAID NIKKI HALEY 

843
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,661
HAS BEEN VERY SPECIAL TO ME, 

844
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:18,496
SHE'S DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB, 

845
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:18,896
FANTASTIC PERSON. 

846
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:19,263
SHE GETS IT. 

847
00:23:19,263 --> 00:23:21,266
SHE'S BEEN AT THE U.N. SINCE 

848
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:22,367
THE BEGINNING. 

849
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,235
SHE TOLD ME SIX MONTHS AGO 

850
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,871
MAYBE AT THE END OF THE YEAR 

851
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:29,674
SHE WANTS TO TAKE A BREAK, WAS 

852
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:30,408
GOVERNOR, THIS PERHAPS EVEN 

853
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:32,177

HAPPY FOR YOU BUT HATE TO LOSE 

859
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:40,985
YOU. 

860
00:23:40,985 --> 00:23:42,921
AT THE END OF THE YEAR SHE WILL 

861
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:44,890
BE LEAVING, WE'LL BE IN 

862
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,290
CONSTANT TOUCH. 

863
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,824
SO WE'RE GETTING SOME NEW 

864
00:23:46,824 --> 00:23:48,026
DETAILS ABOUT U.N. AMBASSADOR 

865
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:48,727
NIKKI HALEY'S RESIGNATION. 

866
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:49,494
WE DO KNOW THAT SHE WILL BE 

867
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,596
LEAVING AT THE END OF THE YEAR. 

868
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:56,935
WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT'S NEXT FOR 

869
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:57,202
HER. 

870
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:57,735
HAS SHE BEEN REASSIGNED? 

871
00:23:57,735 --> 00:23:58,870
AND WHO HER POSSIBLE 

872
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,337
REPLACEMENT WOULD BE. 

873
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,773
KYLIE, I DIDN'T MEAN TO CUT YOU 

874
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:06,711
OFF, BUT GO AHEAD ONTO YOUR 

875
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:06,978
THOUGHT. 

876
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:07,211
>> NO. 

877
00:24:07,211 --> 00:24:08,980
THOSE COMMENTS ARE PRETTY 

878
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,413
NONDESCRIPT, RIGHT? 

879
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:09,714
>> RIGHT. 

880
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,416
>> THEY SAY SHE'S LEAVING, 

881
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,184
THEY'RE NOT SAYING WHY, THEY'RE 

882
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:16,588
NOT POINTING TO ANY BAD BLOOD 

883
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:18,056
BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND 

884
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:18,389
NIKKI HALEY. 

885
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:20,559
THEY'RE SAYING SHE HAS A GOOD 

886
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,092
RELATIONSHIP WITH POMPEO. 

887
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,128
AS I WAS SAYING, HER 

888
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:23,628
RELATIONSHIP WITH REX 

889
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:24,162
TILLERSON, THE PREVIOUS 

890
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:26,064
SECRETARY OF STATE WASN'T THAT 

891
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:26,297
GREAT. 

892
00:24:26,297 --> 00:24:27,866
SO SHE'S WALKING OUT THE DOOR 

893
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,568
IN GOOD STANDING WITH THIS 

894
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:30,035
PRESIDENT IT SEEMS. 

895
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,035
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET DOWN 

896
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:33,271
TO THE BOTTOM OF OF WHY SHE'S 

897
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,173
CHOOSING TO WALK OUT THE DOOR. 

898
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:35,473
>> EXACTLY. 

899
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,909
AND JUST TO FILL EVERYBODY IN, 

900
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,579
IF YOU'RE JUST JOINING US, U.N. 

901
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,280
AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY HAS 

902
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,281
RESIGNED HER POST. 

903
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,616
WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR AN 

904
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:45,183
ANNOUNCEMENT FROM PRESIDENT 

905
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,786
TRUMP OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. 

906
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:49,220
IT WAS SCHEDULED AT 10:30 WHEN 

907
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,055
HE TWEETED OUT BIG ANNOUNCEMENT 

908

00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:54,892
WE DO KNOW THAT SHE IS GOING TO 

911
00:24:54,892 --> 00:24:56,962
BE LEAVING AT THE END OF THE 

912
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:57,195
YEAR. 

913
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,297
CAITLIN HUEY BURNS IS ALSO 

914
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:02,901
HERE, CBSN POLITICAL REPORTER 

915
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:05,203
BREAKING DOWN AND TRYING TO 

916
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:05,804
ANALYZE EXACTLY WHAT'S TAKING 

917
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,940
PLACE IN WASHINGTON JUST 28 

918
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,507
DAYS FROM THE MIDTERMS. 

919
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:10,875
>> THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTAN 

920
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:11,175
POINT HERE. 

921
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:12,611
WE'RE JUST A MONTH AWAY FROM 

922
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:16,114
THE MIDTERM, AND YOU WOULD 

923
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,016
IMAGINE THAT THIS KIND OF 

924
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:18,650
SHAKEUP WOULD BE STARTLING TO 

925
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:18,850
SOME. 

926
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,118
NOW, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO 

927
00:25:21,118 --> 00:25:23,088
CONSIDER THAT HALEY, AGAIN, IS 

928
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,555
NOT INVOLVED IN THE DAY-TO-DAY 

929
00:25:24,555 --> 00:25:25,756
POLITICS GOING ON IN THE 

930
00:25:25,756 --> 00:25:26,491
ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE SHE'S 

931
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,159
HERE IN NEW YORK FOCUSED ON 

932
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:29,728
FOREIGN POLICY AT HER PERCH IN 

933
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,896
THE U.N., AND SHE HAS BEEN 

934
00:25:31,896 --> 00:25:33,098
REALLY ABLE TO CARVE OUT AN 

935
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,666
IDENTITY FOR HERSELF AND MANY 

936
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,102
HAVE SEEN THIS POSITION FOR HER 

937
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,903
AS A LAUNCHING PAD FOR 

938
00:25:38,903 --> 00:25:39,871
SOMETHING ELSE EVENTUALLY, 

939
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,440
WETHER THAT BE A PRESIDENTIAL 

940
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,609
RUN OF HER OWN, OR SOMETHING 

941
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:45,110
ELSE. 

942
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,312
OF COURSE SHE IS VERY POPULAR 

943
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,580
ACROSS THE COUNTRY BUT ALSO 

944
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,247
REALLY POPULAR AMONG 

945
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:50,615
REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE SEEN HER 

946
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:54,919
AS KIND OF A RISING STAR IN THE 

947
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:57,088
PARTY, SOMEONE THAT THE SO-

948
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,223
CALLED NEVER TRUMPERS OR THOSE 

949
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,391
WHO DON'T LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP 

950
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,092
POINT TO HER AS KIND OF A 

951
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:01,926
BRIGHT LIGHT IN THIS 

952
00:26:01,926 --> 00:26:02,293
ADMINISTRATION. 

953
00:26:02,293 --> 00:26:05,163
AND I THINK SO THAT YOU'LL HEAR 

954
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:06,898
FROM MANY OF THEM DISAPPOINT 

955
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,433
THAT SHE IS LEAVING -- 

956
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:09,000
DISAPPOINTMENT THAT SHE IS 

957
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,670
LEAVING, IF IN FACT SHE IS NOT 

958
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,337
REASSIGNED OR GOING SOMEWHERE 

959
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:12,537
ELSE. 

960
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:13,872
I ALSO WONDER IF SHE ISN'T 

961
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:14,939
GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE 

962
00:26:14,939 --> 00:26:16,641
ADMINISTRATION AND IF SHE IS 

963
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,809
LEAVING THIS POST WHETHER IN 

964
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,612
FACT SHE WILL BECOME MORE 

965
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:21,245
POLITICALLY ACTIVE, WHETHER SHE 

966
00:26:21,245 --> 00:26:22,280
WILL BE MORE ENGAGED IN 

967
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,547
POLITICS. 

968
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,716
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF 

969
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:25,350
NEVER TRUMPERS WHO MIGHT LIKE 

970
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,584
TO SEE HER CHALLENGE THE 

971
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:26,884
PRESIDENT. 

972
00:26:26,884 --> 00:26:29,187
I THINK THAT IS A LONGER SHOT 

973
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:32,590
AT THIS POINT GIVEN THAT HE 

974
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,858
REMAINS SO POPULAR AMONG 

975
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,393
REPUBLICANS AT THIS POINT. 

976
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:38,997
AND YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF 

977
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:40,198
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES THIS 

978
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,100
CYCLE ENDEAR HIM IN PLACES THAT 

979
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:42,901
HE IS POPULAR. 

980
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,303
>> KYLIE, I'M JUST SPECULATING 

981
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:45,670
HERE. 

982
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,072
IN TERMS OF POSSIBLE POLITICAL 

983
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,740
ASPIRATIONS FOR NIKKI HALEY, 

984
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,641
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD SPECULATION 

985
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:51,309
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP MIGHT 

986
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,779
CONSIDER HER AS A VICE 

987
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,914
PRESIDENT, A VICE PRESIDENTIAL 

988
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:56,447
CANDIDATE GOING FORWARD? 

989
00:26:56,447 --> 00:26:58,516
AS WE ALL KNOW, WOMEN ON THE 

990
00:26:58,516 --> 00:26:59,049
DEMOCRATIC SIDE, THEY'RE 

991
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:02,954
GEARING UP FOR QUITE A FIGHT IN 

992
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:03,421
THE NEXT ELECTION. 

993
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:06,023
>> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. 

994
00:27:06,023 --> 00:27:07,092
I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT 

995
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:08,860
THE VICE PRESIDENT SPOT AS A 

996
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,195
TICKET FOR NIKKI HALEY, THOUGH, 

997
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,963
BECAUSE I THINK WHAT SHE'S DONE 

998
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,565
IN THIS ADMINISTRATION AND WHAT 

999
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:14,432
A LOT OF TOP ADMINISTRATION 

1000
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:17,702
OFFICIALS HAVE TRIED TO DO IS 

1001
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:19,104
BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE PRESIDENT 

1002
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,172
BUT ALSO CARVE OUT THEIR OWN 

1003
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:21,940
NICHE AND TRY AND BE -- 

1004
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,743
>> KYLIE, LET ME INTERRUPT YOU 

1005
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:25,243
BECAUSE THIS IS BIG. 

1006
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,612
HALEY JUST TOLD REPORTERS IN 

1007
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:30,882
THE OVAL OFFICE SHE WILL BE 

1008
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:33,084
CAMPAIGNING FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP 

1009
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:33,551
IN 2020. 

1010
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:37,689
SO OBVIOUSLY NO HINTS AT BAD 

1011
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:38,056
BLOOD THERE. 

1012
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:42,193
>> NO HINT OF BAD BLOOD THERE. 

1013
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,929
THAT STILL DOESN'T CLOSE THE 

1014
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,664
POSSIBILITY OF HER PERSONAL 

1015
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,700
POLITICAL FUTURE BEING ONE THAT 

1016
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,602
COULD BE DISTINCT TO THAT OF 

1017
00:27:51,602 --> 00:27:52,036
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S. 

1018
00:27:52,036 --> 00:27:52,703
WHEN HIS ADMINISTRATION IS OVER 

1019
00:27:52,703 --> 00:27:54,839
AT THE WHITE HOUSE, WHETHER IT 

1020
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:59,611
BE IN 2020 OR 2024, SHE IS A 

1021
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,678
PERSON WHO HAS EXTENSIVE 

1022
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,714
POLITICAL AMBITIONS AND HER 

1023
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:03,781
TEAM HAS NEVER BEEN NECESSARILY 

1024
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:05,083
DISCREET ABOUT THAT. 

1025
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:09,220
THEY KNOW THAT SHE IS A VERY 

1026
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,622
FORCEFUL, COMPASSIONATE WOMAN 

1027
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:13,158
WITH A REALLY GREAT AMERICAN 

1028
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:13,391
STORY. 

1029
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,692
SHE HERSELF IS AN IMMIGRANT. 

1030
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,528
SHE HAS INDIAN PARENTS, SHE 

1031
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:16,961
TALKS ABOUT THAT. 

1032
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,697
AND SO I THINK THAT TO SAY THAT 

1033
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,232
HER POLITICAL FUTURE IS TIED TO 

1034
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,702
TRUMP'S JUST BECAUSE SHE'S 

1035
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,903
CAMPAIGNING FOR HIM ISN'T 

1036
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:25,303
NECESSARILY TRUE. 

1037
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,572
BUT IT DOES SHOW THAT SHE'S 

1038
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:28,105
STILL SUPPORTIVE OF THIS 

1039
00:28:28,105 --> 00:28:28,406
PRESIDENT. 

1040
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:30,642
>> WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT 

1041
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:32,110
ANNOUNCEMENT, CAITLIN, THAT SHE 

1042
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,078
WILL BE CAMPAIGNING FOR HIM IN 

1043
00:28:34,078 --> 00:28:34,278
2020? 

1044
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:35,046
>> WELL, I THINK CERTAINLY, 

1045
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,182
JUST TO PICK UP ON THAT POINT, 

1046
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,650
IT'S NOT LIKE ANYBODY REALLY 

1047
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,984
WANTS TO ROCK THE BOAT FOR THE 

1048
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:40,551
PARTY AT THIS POINT EITHER. 

1049
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:42,887
SO IT MAKES A LOT OF POLITICAL 

1050
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,989
SENSE TO SAY THAT SHE IS 

1051
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:45,857
REMAINING SUPPORTIVE OF THE 

1052
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:46,157
PRESIDENT. 

1053
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,292
THERE COULD BE A LOT OF 

1054
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:48,759
DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT GO INTO 

1055
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:48,959
THIS. 

1056
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:50,829
BUT ANOTHER THING TO KEEP IN 

1057
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,731
MIND ABOUT HALEY IN ADDITION TO 

1058
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:56,201
WHAT KYLIE WAS SAYING IN TERMS 

1059
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,236
OF HOW SHE HAS BEEN REALLY 

1060
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,604
ADMIRED BY MANY REPUBLICANS 

1061
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:00,305
JUST GIVEN HER BACKGROUND, IN 

1062
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:05,076
2016 SHE TOOK WHAT WAS SEEN AS 

1063
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,444
A BIG POLITICAL RISK IN CALLING 

1064
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,580
FOR THE CONFEDERATE FLAG TO BE 

1065
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,247
REMOVED FROM STATEHOUSE GROUNDS 

1066
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,115
IN SOUTH CAROLINA WHILE SHE WAS 

1067
00:29:11,115 --> 00:29:12,283
GOVERNOR. 

1068
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:13,852
THAT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A 

1069
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:16,487
NATIONAL DEBATE OVER THAT, AND 

1070
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:21,159
OF COURSE THIS WAS SHORTLY 

1071
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,360
AFTER THAT HORRIFIC AND TRAGIC 

1072
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,295
SHOOTING OF INNOCENT AFRICAN-

1073
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,797
AMERICAN PARISHIONERS BY A 

1074
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:27,698
WHITE MAN IN THAT CHURCH IN 

1075
00:29:27,698 --> 00:29:28,733
CHARLESTON. 

1076
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,668
AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT 

1077
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:31,468
REALLY ROCKED THE COUNTRY. 

1078
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:35,106
AND SHE CALLED FOR THE REMOVAL 

1079
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,374
OF THE CONFEDERATE FLAG FROM 

1080
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:37,508
THE STATEHOUSE GROUNDS SHORTLY 

1081
00:29:37,508 --> 00:29:39,878
AFTER THAT IN 2016, AND A LOT 

1082
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:40,545
OF PEOPLE IN THE REPUBLICAN 

1083
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,613
PARTY AND QUITE FRANKLY OUTSIDE 

1084
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:46,117
OF IT LOOKED TO HER AS A MODEL 

1085
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,119
FOR ADDRESSING THIS IN THAT 

1086
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:48,786
REALLY TOUGH POLITICAL TIME. 

1087
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:52,190
AND SO SHE HAS REALLY RISEN TO 

1088
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,225
PROMINENCE OVER THE PAST 

1089
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:57,195
SEVERAL YEARS GIVEN HER 

1090
00:29:57,195 --> 00:30:00,098
BACKGROUND, GIVEN HER ABILITY 

1091
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,299
TO REALLY KIND OF ENGAGE THE 

1092
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:01,599
MOMENT. 

1093
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,603
AND SO SHE HAS BEEN CONSIDERED 

1094
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,005
SOMEONE WHO DOES HAVE AMBITIONS 

1095
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,940
BEYOND THIS AND WE'LL SEE HOW 

1096
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,340
THAT SHAKES OUT. 

1097
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,342
THIS IS A POSITION THAT WOULD 

1098
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:14,178
KIND OF ALLOW A LAUNCHING PAD 

1099
00:30:14,178 --> 00:30:14,678
FOR HIGHER OFFICE. 

1100
00:30:14,678 --> 00:30:17,148
>> KYLIE, WEIGH IN ON THAT A 

1101
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:21,185
LITTLE BIT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, 

1102
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:22,754
LOOKING BACK AT FORMER TWEETS 

1103
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:23,388
FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP, TODAY, 

1104
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,790
YOU KNOW, HE'S TWEETING OUT, 

1105
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,591
YOU KNOW, A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT 

1106
00:30:27,591 --> 00:30:27,992
WITH MY FRIEND. 

1107
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,460
A WHILE AGO, IT WASN'T TOO MANY 

1108
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,527
YEARS AGO WHEN HE TWEETED OUT 

1109
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:34,666
THAT THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH 

1110
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,266
CAROLINA ARE EMBARRASSED BY 

1111
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:35,466
HER. 

1112
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:38,970
SO DEFINITELY A TUMULTUOUS PAST 

1113
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:39,370
BETWEEN THE TWO. 

1114
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,172
TALKING ABOUT TAKING RISKS, HOW 

1115
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,142
BIG OF A RISK WAS IT TO BE 

1116
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:45,176
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S U.N. 

1117
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,545
AMBASSADOR IF SHE WANTS TO GO 

1118
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:48,579
ON FOR HIGHER OFFICE HERSELF? 

1119
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:50,381
>> I THINK THAT'S A GREAT 

1120
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:50,782
POINT. 

1121
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,383
I MEAN, IT WAS A BIG RISK, AND 

1122
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,886
I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY 

1123
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:57,422
THAT SHE'S PLAYED IT PRETTY 

1124
00:30:57,422 --> 00:30:57,622
WELL. 

1125
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:58,923
SHE'S BEEN FORCEFUL WHERE SHE 

1126
00:30:58,923 --> 00:30:59,490
NEEDS TO BE. 

1127
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,558
I WANT TO POINT OUT, THOUGH, 

1128
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:03,361
THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE HAS BEEN 

1129
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,897
PART OF EVERY SINGLE POLICY 

1130
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,231
DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF FOREIGN 

1131
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:09,701
POLICY AND THIS WHITE HOUSE. 

1132
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,168
NORTH KOREA, THAT'S A BATON 

1133
00:31:11,168 --> 00:31:13,404
THAT IS HELD BY SECRETARY OF 

1134
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:14,305
STATE MIKE POMPEO. 

1135
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:14,838
ANOTHER DECISION THAT WAS 

1136
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:17,208
RECENTLY MADE THAT WE PUT A LOT 

1137
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,511
OF FOCUS ON WAS THE NEW REFUGEE 

1138
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:21,679
NUMBERS COMING OUT OF THIS 

1139
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,213
ADMINISTRATION. 

1140
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,247
THEY CUT THE REFUGEE NUMBERS 

1141
00:31:23,247 --> 00:31:26,484
THAT ARE TO BE LET IN NEXT YEAR 

1142
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:26,784
TO 30,000. 

1143
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,353
THAT'S THE LOWEST NUMBER THAT 

1144
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,889
WE HAVE SEEN IN MORE THAN 30 

1145
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:32,122
YEARS. 

1146
00:31:32,122 --> 00:31:35,693
AND HALEY WAS NOT IN THE LAST 

1147
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,194
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT NUMBER. 

1148
00:31:37,194 --> 00:31:38,763
SO THERE WERE SOME FRUSTRATIONS 

1149
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:41,332
ON BEHALF OF HER TEAM IN TERMS 

1150
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:45,003
OF NOT GIVING THE LAST FINAL 

1151
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,337
SAY, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SHE 

1152
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:47,839
COMES FROM REFUGEE PARENTS. 

1153
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,974
SO THERE HAVE BEEN MOMENTS 

1154
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:51,776
WHERE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN LOCK 

1155
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:52,377
STEP. 

1156
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,412
BUT, YOU KNOW, AS CAITLIN SAID, 

1157
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,414
I MEAN, HALEY IS SOMEONE WITH 

1158
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:56,881
POLITICAL AMBITIONS. 

1159
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:59,283
AND SO SHE KNOWS WHERE TO PICK 

1160
00:31:59,283 --> 00:32:00,418
HER BATTLES AND WHERE NOT TO. 

1161
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,620
SHE KNOWS, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE 

1162
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,355
SAW THE ANONYMOUS OP-ED FROM A 

1163
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:05,623
SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL 

1164
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:07,225
COME OUT A FEW WEEKS AGO, SHE 

1165
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,593
WROTE A COUNTER OP-ED TO THAT, 

1166
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,695
BASICALLY SAYING THAT SHE IS IN 

1167
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:11,629
LINE WITH THE PRESIDENT, AND 

1168
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:12,797
WHEN SHE DISAGREES WITH HIM, 

1169
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:13,764
SHE DOES SO DIRECTLY. 

1170
00:32:13,764 --> 00:32:14,699
>> ALL RIGHT. 

1171
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:18,703
WE WANT TO BRING IN ON THE 

1172
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:19,871
PHONE LESLIE SANCHEZ, OUR 

1173
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:20,371
REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST. 

1174
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,573
AND, LESLIE, THERE'S A LOT OF 

1175
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:24,108
SPECULATION GOING ON RIGHT NOW. 

1176
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:27,178
THERE'S SOME SPECULATION THAT 

1177
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:30,081
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, PETE 

1178
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,149
SESSIONS, IF HE LEFT OFFICE, 

1179
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,283
SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR LINDSAY 

1180
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,217
GRAHAM COULD BE CONSIDERED FOR 

1181
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,552
THAT POSITION, OPENING UP 

1182
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:36,387
ANOTHER SEAT IN SOUTH CAROLINA, 

1183
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:39,524
A SENATE SEAT WHICH COULD GO TO 

1184
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:40,391
NIKKI HALEY. 

1185
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,794
SO TALK US THROUGH THAT WHOLE 

1186
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,061
SCENARIO. 

1187
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:43,327
>> SURE. 

1188
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:46,431
THERE'S A LOT OF BUZZ INSOUTH 

1189
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,833
CAROLINA RIGHT NOW OF THAT 

1190
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,467
EXACT VIABILITY AND 

1191
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:49,800
POSSIBILITY. 

1192
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,436
AND MANY PEOPLE SPECULATE THAT 

1193
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,404
THIS IS KIND OF MOVING -- 

1194
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:57,175
SETTING UP THE SHUFFLING OF THE 

1195
00:32:57,175 --> 00:33:00,244
CARDS AND THESE CABINET 

1196
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:00,878
POSITIONS POST-ELECTION DAY. 

1197
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:02,747
SO IT'S OPENING -- CREATING 

1198
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,415
OPPORTUNITIES AND OPENINGSES 

1199
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:06,784
THAT DO NOT HAVE TO BE -- 

1200
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:09,687
OPENINGS THAT DO NOT HAVE TO BE 

1201
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:10,388
FILLED UNTIL AFTER THE 

1202
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:11,789
ELECTION, BECAUSE IT WAS ALWAYS 

1203
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,056
HIS IDEA TO NOT DO SOMETHING 

1204
00:33:13,056 --> 00:33:14,425
DRAMATIC WITH SESSIONS UNTIL 

1205
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:14,925
THE MIDTERMS WERE OVER. 

1206
00:33:14,925 --> 00:33:16,260
SO IF SOMETHING LIKE THAT WERE 

1207
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,929
TO HAPPEN AND LINDSAY GRAHAM 

1208
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,398
WERE TO MOVE INTO A POSITION AT 

1209
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,133
JUSTICE WHICH HE HAS OFTEN SAID 

1210
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,268
HE DID NOT WANT TO DO, HE WAS 

1211
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:28,372
VERY HAPPY -- LET'S REITERATE, 

1212
00:33:28,372 --> 00:33:32,175
HE WAS VERY HAPPY -- HE WAITED 

1213
00:33:32,175 --> 00:33:33,611
A VERY LONG TIME TO BE FOR 

1214
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:34,544
SENATE IN SOUTH CAROLINA. 

1215
00:33:34,544 --> 00:33:36,447
WHAT IT DOES IS CREATE SOME 

1216
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:38,416
EXCITING POSSIBILITIES FOR THE 

1217
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:39,617
REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND 

1218
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,185
ESPECIALLY IN UNIFYING THE 

1219
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:41,919
REPUBLICAN PARTY. 

1220
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,287
NIKKI HALEY IS SOMEBODY WHO'S 

1221
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:43,988
EXTREMELY POPULAR. 

1222
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,122
SHE HAS AN INDEPENDENT STANCE. 

1223
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:48,025
WHEN SHE WENT INTO THE U.N., 

1224
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:50,395
SHE HAD SOME GUIDELINES AND 

1225
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,630
STIPULATIONS, SHE WANTED TO BE 

1226
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,030
A POLICY PERSON. 

1227
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,699
SHE SAID SOMEBODY OTHER THAN 

1228
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:55,833
SHE SAID A WALLFLOWER. 

1229
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,668
SHE WANTED TO BE PART OF THE 

1230
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:58,235
DECISION MAKING PROCESS. 

1231
00:33:58,235 --> 00:34:00,271
AND I THINK SHE CAN WALK AWAY 

1232
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:00,872
FEELING SHE DID THAT. 

1233
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,840
IF SHE CAME AND SHE WAS TO FILL 

1234
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,042
AN OPEN SEAT IN THE SENATE, 

1235
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,043
MANY BELIEVE IT WOULD OPEN THE 

1236
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:07,345
DOOR FOR HER TO BE A V.P. 

1237
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,179
OR A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN 

1238
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,114
THE FUTURE. 

1239
00:34:11,114 --> 00:34:12,650
AND SO, AGAIN, IT'S ABOUT 

1240
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,752
LINING UP FOR TWO, FOUR, SIX 

1241
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:15,319
YEARS FROM NOW. 

1242
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:15,819
>> STAY THERE, LESLIE. 

1243
00:34:15,819 --> 00:34:16,821
WE'LL CHAT WITH YOU A LITTLE 

1244
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:17,688
BIT MORE IN JUST A SECOND. 

1245
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,322
I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME 

1246
00:34:19,322 --> 00:34:21,092
MORE COLOR, SOME COMMENTS THAT 

1247
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,995
ARE COMING OUT OF THE OVAL 

1248
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,030
OFFICE FROM NIKKI HALEY AS SHE 

1249
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,998
APPARENTLY SAID THAT HER TWO 

1250
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:30,467
YEARS AS THE UNITED NATIONS 

1251
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:31,835
AMBASSADOR HAS BEEN AN HONOR OF 

1252
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:32,168
A LIFETIME. 

1253
00:34:32,168 --> 00:34:33,036
SHE SAID WE WILL PUT OUR 

1254
00:34:33,036 --> 00:34:34,938
EMBASSY WHERE WE WANT TO PUT 

1255
00:34:34,938 --> 00:34:35,272
OUR EMBASSY. 

1256
00:34:35,272 --> 00:34:36,440
THE U.S. IS STRONG AGAIN IN A 

1257
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,609
WAY PEOPLE SHOULD BE PROUD OF. 

1258
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,277
SHE WENT ON TO SAY SHE CAN'T 

1259
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:42,013
SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT 

1260
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,614
JARED AND IVANKA, THANK YOU TO 

1261
00:34:44,614 --> 00:34:44,915
MY FAMILY. 

1262
00:34:44,915 --> 00:34:45,949
AND SHE ALSO SAID NOTHING IS 

1263
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,952
SET ON WHERE I'M GOING TO GO. 

1264
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:49,920
WAS GOVERNOR FOR SIX YEARS, 

1265
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,255
EIGHT YEARS OF INTENSE TIME. 

1266
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:52,156
I BELIEVE IN TERM LIMITS. 

1267
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,592
SHE SAID SHE'S NOT RUNNING FOR 

1268
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,260
PRESIDENT IN 2020. 

1269
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,228
SHE WILL SUPPORT PRESIDENT 

1270
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:57,995
TRUMP. 

1271
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,163
SHE BELIEVES GOVERNMENT 

1272
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:01,199
OFFICIALS NEED TO MOVE ON. 

1273
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,733
WE ALSO ARE GETTING WORD THAT 

1274
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,203
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO SAID WHEN 

1275
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:06,037
WE CAME INTO OFFICE ALMOST 

1276
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:07,238
INEVITABLE IN THE EYES OF THE 

1277
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:08,539
WORLD THAT WE WOULD BE GOING TO 

1278
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,408
WAR WITH NORTH KOREA, ALLUDING 

1279
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,576
TO THE FACT THAT U.N. 

1280
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:12,643
AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY REALLY 

1281
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:15,045
HELPED PLAY A ROLE THERE. 

1282
00:35:15,045 --> 00:35:17,081
HE ALSO THANKED HALEY AND SAID 

1283
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,683
THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE WAY OF 

1284
00:35:19,683 --> 00:35:19,950
DOING IT. 

1285
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,252
IN TERMS OF A SUCCESSOR, HE 

1286
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:23,220
SAID THERE ARE A NUMBER OF 

1287
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,822
PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO DO 

1288
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:25,022
THIS. 

1289
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:25,722
IT IS A MUCH MORE GLAMOROUS 

1290
00:35:25,722 --> 00:35:28,893
POSITION THAN IT WAS A COUPLE 

1291
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:29,460
OF YEARS AGO. 

1292
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,229
KYLIE, HOW MUCH OF A ROLE DID 

1293
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:38,502
NIKKI HALEY PLAY IN ELEVATING 

1294
00:35:38,502 --> 00:35:39,603
THE ROLE OF U.N. AMBASSADOR? 

1295
00:35:39,603 --> 00:35:40,605
>>REPORTER:  YOU KNOW, SHE 

1296
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:41,839
WOULD SAY SHE PLAYED A HUGE 

1297
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:42,640
ROLE IN THAT. 

1298
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,342
I THINK THERE WOULD BE SOME WHO 

1299
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,843
MAY CONTEST BECAUSE THERE HAVE 

1300
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:47,979
BEEN PAST AMBASSADORS TO THE 

1301
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,113
U.N. WHO HAVE OBVIOUSLY HAD A 

1302
00:35:49,113 --> 00:35:50,815
REALLY PUBLIC ROLE AS WELL, 

1303
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,217
SAMANTHA POWER BEING ONE OF 

1304
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:53,751
THOSE. 

1305
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:54,619
BUT WHAT'S A LITTLE BIT 

1306
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,454
DIFFERENT ABOUT NIKKI HALEY AND 

1307
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:59,857
FORMER AMBASSADORS TO THE U.N. 

1308
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:00,691
FOR MANY ADMINISTRATIONS IS 

1309
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,660
THAT NIKKI HALEY IS VERY 

1310
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,996
POLITICAL, AND THAT'S NOT 

1311
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,097
ALWAYS THE CASE FOR THIS ROLE. 

1312
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,398
IT'S SOMEONE WHO HAS TO WORK 

1313
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,100
WITH WORLD LEADERS, IT'S 

1314
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,135
SOMEONE WHO HAS TO KIND OF SEE 

1315
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:12,903
WHERE THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER, 

1316
00:36:12,903 --> 00:36:16,207
WHERE THEY CAN PUSH TOGETHER. 

1317
00:36:16,207 --> 00:36:17,307
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY SOMEONE 

1318
00:36:17,307 --> 00:36:18,876
WHO IS PUSHING THE AGENDA OF 

1319
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:21,178
THE WHITE HOUSE, AND THAT WAS 

1320
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:23,881
WHAT NIKKI HALEY CONTINUED TO 

1321
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:24,915
DO TIME AND TIME AGAIN. 

1322
00:36:24,915 --> 00:36:27,084
AND SHE OFTEN GOT POINTS FROM 

1323
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,854
THIS WHITE HOUSE FOR HOW TOUGH 

1324
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,922
SHE WAS AGAINST LEADERS ON THE 

1325
00:36:31,922 --> 00:36:32,990
INTERNATIONAL STAGE WHO WEREN'T 

1326
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:33,824
IN LINE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

1327
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:36,193
SHE SAID AT ONE POINT, YOU 

1328
00:36:36,193 --> 00:36:38,829
KNOW, WE ARE TAKING NAMES WHEN 

1329
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:42,500
THAT DECISION WAS MADE ABOUT 

1330
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,434
MOVING THE EMBASSY IN ISRAEL 

1331
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,102
AND WORLD LEADERS CAME OUT 

1332
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:45,469
AGAINST TRUMP. 

1333
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:46,804
SHE BASICALLY WAS THREATENING 

1334
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,173
THAT IF YOU ARE NOT SUPPORTIVE 

1335
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,976
OF THE POLICY OF THIS WHITE 

1336
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,077
HOUSE, YOU BETTER GET READY 

1337
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:54,078
BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE 

1338
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,180
SOMETHING COMING YOUR WAY WHICH 

1339
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,381
ISN'T GOING TO BE SO GREAT. 

1340
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,483
SO SHE WASN'T AFRAID TO MAKE IT 

1341
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,986
A POLITICAL POSITION, AND THAT 

1342
00:37:01,986 --> 00:37:03,788
IS WHAT IS A BIT DIFFERENT 

1343
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,156
ABOUT HER AND HOW SHE DECIDED 

1344
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,324
TO APPROACH THIS ROLE. 

1345
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,724
>> SO WE DO KNOW THAT THE PRESS 

1346
00:37:07,724 --> 00:37:09,159
HAS LEFT THE OVAL OFFICE AND 

1347
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:12,129
THEY ARE GOING TO BE FEEDING 

1348
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:13,631
TAPE BACK, SO WE CAN LISTEN IN 

1349
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:16,234
TO THE EVENT THAT JUST PLAYED 

1350
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,201
OUT THERE IN THE OVAL OFFICE 

1351
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:19,370
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND A 

1352
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,171
FORMER U.N. AMBASSADOR NIKKI 

1353
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:20,404
HALEY. 

1354
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,073
SHE'S SET TO RESIGN AT THE END 

1355
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:22,740
OF THIS YEAR. 

1356
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,576
ON THE PHONE WITH US IS 

1357
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,410
REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST LESLIE 

1358
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,278
SANCHEZ WHO JOINED OUR 

1359
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:27,611
CONVERSATION. 

1360
00:37:27,611 --> 00:37:29,046
AND, YOU KNOW, LESLIE, I NEVER 

1361
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,815
GOT TO ASK YOU, BUT WAS THERE 

1362
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:36,320
ANY -- DID YOU HAVE ANY 

1363
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:36,921
INDICATION THAT THIS WOULD 

1364
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,154
HAPPEN? 

1365
00:37:37,154 --> 00:37:37,922
>> NO. 

1366
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,290
I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S 

1367
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:39,590
SURPRISING. 

1368
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,792
IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE SHE 

1369
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,427
TOLD HER STAFF THIS MORNING. 

1370
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,196
FOR MANY WHO WONDERED ABOUT 

1371
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:48,299
NIKKI HALEY IN THE CABINET FROM 

1372
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,700
THE BEGINNING AFTER THE 

1373
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,035
PRESIDENT'S WIN IN 2016, IT WAS 

1374
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,870
ALWAYS A QUESTION OF HOW THE 

1375
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,938
DYNAMIC WOULD WORK TOGETHER, 

1376
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,408
ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE WAS SOME 

1377
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:57,908
CONTENTION IN THE 2016 

1378
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:58,476
PRESIDENTIAL. 

1379
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,778
SHE HAD SIDED WITH MARCO RUBIO 

1380
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,178
AS HER CANDIDATE. 

1381
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:05,015
AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE 

1382
00:38:05,015 --> 00:38:07,685
MARCO RUBIO EVEN DEFENDED HER 

1383
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:09,153
EARLIER THIS YEAR WHEN SHE RAN 

1384
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:10,254
INTO SOME POLITICAL PROBLEMS, 

1385
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,055
HE CAME OUT TO HER DEFENSE. 

1386
00:38:12,055 --> 00:38:12,923
AND SO THE ALLIANCES WERE 

1387
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:15,059
ALWAYS DIFFERENT AND THE 

1388
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:15,693
PRESIDENT IS BIG ON LOYALTY. 

1389
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,696
SO THE INTERESTING PART IS THAT 

1390
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:20,364
SHE WAITED UNTIL THAT TWO-YEAR 

1391
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:21,965
MARK AND THAT'S KIND OF A FUNNY 

1392
00:38:21,965 --> 00:38:24,001
IN -- IN POLITICS THAT'S A 

1393
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,302
FUNNY TERM BECAUSE YOU DO YOUR 

1394
00:38:25,302 --> 00:38:26,937
TIME, IT'S A BIT OF SERVICE. 

1395
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,673
úY 

1396
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,274
THEN YOU GO DO SOMETHING ELSE. 

1397
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:34,845
SO I FEEL SHE WAS A GOOD 

1398
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:38,315
SOLDIER AND A GOOD -- A MEMBER 

1399
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:40,384
FOR THE PRESIDENT IN SHARING 

1400
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,520
HER OPINION AND IT WAS OFTEN A 

1401
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:42,987
DIFFERING OPINION. 

1402
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:43,587
AND SHE'S STRONG ENOUGH TO 

1403
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:45,089
STAND THERE AND EXPRESS THAT TO 

1404
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,091
THE PRESIDENT AND STILL SUPPORT 

1405
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,259
HIS IDEALS AND BE THAT 

1406
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,693
POLITICAL ROLE THAT WE JUST 

1407
00:38:49,693 --> 00:38:52,730
TALKED ABOUT, THAT'S A VERY 

1408
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,063
UNIQUE BLEND. 

1409
00:38:53,063 --> 00:38:53,597
>> GO AHEAD, CAITLIN. 

1410
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:55,766
>> JUST TO PICK UP ON THAT 

1411
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:56,433
POINT, IT HAS BEEN VERY 

1412
00:38:56,433 --> 00:38:58,436
úINTERE 

1413
00:38:58,436 --> 00:38:59,570
HALEY REALLY BE UNAFRAID IN 

1414
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,172
CARVING OUT HER OWN IDENTITY 

1415
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:05,076
AND IN MAKING CLEAR WHEN SHE 

1416
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:07,077
DISAGREES WITH THE PRESIDENT 

1417
00:39:07,077 --> 00:39:07,577
AND THE ADMINISTRATION. 

1418
00:39:07,577 --> 00:39:08,612
REMEMBER JUST RECENTLY WHEN 

1419
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,481
THERE WAS TALK OF ADDITIONAL 

1420
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,850
SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA, LARRY 

1421
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,350
CUDLOW, THE PRESIDENT'S 

1422
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,085
ECONOMIC ADVISER SAID THAT 

1423
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,386
NIKKI HALEY WHO HAD JUST BEEN 

1424
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:16,787
ON THE SUNDAY SHOWS TALKING 

1425
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:17,821
ABOUT IT MAY HAVE BEEN CONFUSED 

1426
00:39:17,821 --> 00:39:20,725
AND SHE HAD RESPONDED I DON'T 

1427
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:21,058
GET CONFUSED. 

1428
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:24,161
AND SO SHE HAS BEEN UNABASHED 

1429
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:27,498
ABOUT STICKING UP FOR HERSELF 

1430
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:28,566
IN THIS ADMINISTRATION, AND, 

1431
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,533
AGAIN, REALLY FORGING AHEAD 

1432
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,301
WITH HER OWN IDENTITY HERE. 

1433
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,469
AND I THINK IT'S REALLY 

1434
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,170
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AS WE'RE 

1435
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,972
LOOKING AT THE POOL REPORTS 

1436
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:35,672
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE 

1437
00:39:35,672 --> 00:39:37,241
PRESIDENT'S -- THE WAY IN WHICH 

1438
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,642
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TALKING 

1439
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:39,843
ABOUT NIKKI HALEY, SAYING THAT 

1440
00:39:39,843 --> 00:39:41,312
SHE HAS BEEN VERY SPECIAL TO 

1441
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,280
ME, SHE HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE 

1442
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,448
JOB, SHE'S A FANTASTIC PERSON, 

1443
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,417
SHE GETS IT, SHE TOLD ME SIX 

1444
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:47,418
MONTHS AGO THAT MAYBE AT THE 

1445
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,820
END OF THE YEAR SHE WANTED TO 

1446
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,523
TAKE A BREAK, IF IN FACT NIKKI 

1447
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,124
HALEY HAS POLITICAL AMBITIONS 

1448
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:56,794
OR IS REALLY SERIOUSLY THINKING 

1449
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:58,095
ABOUT THEM GOING AHEAD, THAT 

1450
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,897
SUPPORT FROM THE PRESIDENT 

1451
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,266
LEAVING ON GOOD TERMS FROM THIS 

1452

STRONG IN A WAY THAT SHOULD 

1590
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:36,333
MAKE ALL AMERICANS VERY PROUD, 

1591
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,668
AND I WANT TO SAY IT'S NOT JUST 

1592
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:38,634
THE PRESIDENT I WANT TO THINK, 

1593
00:45:38,634 --> 00:45:39,536
THE FAMILY IN GENERAL, THE 

1594
00:45:39,536 --> 00:45:40,637
FIRST LADY HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT 

1595
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:41,839
VERY KIND TO ME, I CAN'T SAY 

1596
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:42,773
ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT JARED

KUSHNER AND YVONNE, -- IVANKA. 

1598
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:52,849
JARED KUSHNER IS SUCH A GENIUS 

1599
00:45:52,849 --> 00:45:54,284
THE PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE, 

1600
00:45:54,284 --> 00:46:00,924
WORKING ON THE NAFTA PLAN, AND 

1601
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:05,195
IVANKA, THEY DO MORE BEHIND THE 

1602
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:07,731
SCENES, THAT I WISH MORE PEOPLE 

1603
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:08,899
KNEW ABOUT, WE ARE A BETTER 

1604
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:09,766
COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE 

1605
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:11,268

00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,809
ONES, I ADORE THEM, AND TO TEAM 

1609
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:25,382
US UN, THEY PUT A LOT OF HEART 

1610
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:26,950
IN IT, AND REALLY WANTED TO 

1611
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,684
MAKE AMERICA PROUD, WITH THAT, 

1612
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:29,186
I'M NOT LEAVING UNTIL THE END 

1613
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:34,558
OF THE YEAR, MY GOAL IS THAT WE 

1614
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:35,726
MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS IN 

1615
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:36,526
PLACE FOR THE NEXT AMBASSADOR 

1616
00:46:36,526 --> 00:46:37,794
TO COME IN, BUT IT IS A GREAT 

1617
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,596
DAY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND 

1618
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,198
I'M PROUD TO HAVE BEEN PART OF 

1619
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:43,200
A TEAM, NOW I DON'T HAVE 

1620
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,134
ANYTHING SET ON WHERE I'M GOING 

1621
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,869
TO GO, I THINK THE MAIN THING 

1622
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:49,673
WAS, I WAS GOVERNOR FOR SIX 

1623
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:53,510

1624
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:54,778
HURRICANE, THOUSAND YEAR FLOOD, 

1625
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:59,616
A CHURCH SHOOTING, THERE WAS 

1626
00:46:59,616 --> 00:47:00,750
LOT, AND DUE TO YEARS OF 

1627
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:01,752
RUSSIA, IRAN AND NORTH KOREA, 

1628
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:05,188
IT HAS BEEN EIGHT YEARS OF 

1629
00:47:05,188 --> 00:47:06,456
INTENSE TIME, I'M A BELIEVER IN 

1630
00:47:06,456 --> 00:47:07,324
TERM LIMITS, I THINK YOU HAVE 

1631
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:08,592
TO BE SELFLESS TO KNOW WHEN YOU 

1632
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:09,259
STEP ASIDE AND ALLOW SOMEONE 

1633
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:10,160
ELSE TO DO THE JOB. 

1634
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,898
THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT, IT HAS 

1635
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:15,732
BEEN AN HONORABLE LIFETIME, FOR 

1636
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:17,167
ALL OF YOU ASKING ABOUT 2020, 

1637
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,568
NO I AM NOT RUNNING FOR 2020, 

1638
00:47:18,568 --> 00:47:24,308
WHAT I WILL BE DOING IS 

1639
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:24,908
CAMPAIGNING FOR THIS ONE, I 

1640
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:25,742
WILL SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT IN 

1641
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:30,847
THE NEXT ELECTION.>> THANK YOU, 

1642
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:31,080
NIKKI. 

1643
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,716
>> YOU LISTED OFF A LONG LIST 

1644
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:35,251
OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS , WHY WOULD 

1645
00:47:35,251 --> 00:47:36,453
YOU WANT TO LEAVE THAT BEHIND? 

1646
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:37,154
IS IT A PERSONAL DECISION 

1647
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:38,155
BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN AWAY FROM 

1648
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:40,924
YOUR FAMILY FOR SO LONG? 

1649
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:42,626
>> MY FAMILY HAS BEEN 

1650
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:48,332
SUPPORTIVE, THERE IS NOT THAT 

1651
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:49,266
REASON, BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR 

1652
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:49,900
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TO KNOW 

1653
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,234
WHEN IT'S TIME TO STEP ASIDE, I 

1654
00:47:51,234 --> 00:47:52,669
HAVE GIVEN EVERYTHING I'VE GOT 

1655
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:54,838
THESE LAST EIGHT YEARS, I THINK 

1656
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:55,672
THAT SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD TO 

1657
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:59,242
ROTATE IN OTHER PEOPLE WHO CAN 

1658
00:47:59,242 --> 00:48:00,777
PUT THE SAME ENERGY AND POWER 

1659
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:03,146
INTO IT, A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL 

1660
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:04,715
SAY THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS 

1661
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,817
WHY I'M LEAVING, THE TRUTH IS, 

1662
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:07,851
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS 

1663
00:48:07,851 --> 00:48:08,818
ADMINISTRATION, THE PRESIDENT 

1664
00:48:08,818 --> 00:48:12,756
HAS ANOTHER PERSON TO FIGHT, 

1665
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:18,895
GOING INTO BODY -- THE UN WITH 

1666
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:20,130
BODY ARMOR EVERY DAY TO DEFEND 

1667
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:21,031
AMERICA, I WILL NEVER TRULY 

1668
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:21,898
STEP ASIDE FOR -- FROM FIGHTING 

1669
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:25,268
FOR MY COUNTRY, IT IS MY TIME. 

1670
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:29,106
>> WHY MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT 

1671
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:29,306
NOW? 

1672
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,141
BIGGER SHE WILL BE STAYING 

1673
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:35,913
UNTIL -- >> SHE WILL BE STAYING 

1674
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,147
UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, 

1675
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:38,382
WHICH WILL BE TWO YEARS, I WAS 

1676
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,217
THINKING WHEN WE CAME INTO 

1677
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:41,051
OFFICE, IT WAS ALMOST 

1678
00:48:41,051 --> 00:48:43,487
INEVITABLE IN THE MINDS OF MANY 

1679
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,122
THAT WE WERE GOING TO WAR WITH 

1680
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:48,859
NORTH KOREA, IF YOU ASKED 

1681
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:54,564
PRESIDENT OBAMA, HE SAID THAT 

1682
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:55,332
WAS HIS BIGGEST PROBLEM WHEN WE 

1683
00:48:55,332 --> 00:48:56,800
SET MET RIGHT HERE, THAT LOOKS 

1684
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,567
LIKE A REAL PROBLEM, IRAN LOOK 

1685
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:03,907
LIKE A REAL PROBLEM, -- LOOKED 

1686
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:04,875
LIKE A REAL PROBLEM, AND NOW 

1687
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,109
THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR 

1688
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,378
LIVES, THEY'VE GOT RIGHTS IN 

1689
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:09,780
THEIR CITIES, THE INFLATION, 

1690
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,150
THE ECONOMY IS IN TATTERS, AND 

1691
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,017
AT SOME POINT THEY WILL 

1692
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:16,620
PROBABLY WANT TO COME AND MAKE 

1693
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,955
A REAL DEAL, NOT THE RIDICULOUS 

1694
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,657
DEAL THAT THEY MADE, THAT WAS 

1695
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,358
UNACCEPTABLE FOR ME, WOULD IT 

1696
00:49:22,358 --> 00:49:26,363
DIFFERENCE, WHEN WE FIRST CAME, 

1697
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:28,198
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THE DAY 

1698
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:29,933
BEFORE WE CAME, IF YOU LOOK AT 

1699
00:49:29,933 --> 00:49:32,903
NORTH KOREA, THERE WAS A DEAL, 

1700
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:34,838
SOMETHING THAT WAS A 

1701
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:36,740
POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING PROBLEM,

1702
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,108
AND THE RELATIONSHIPS ARE VERY 

1703
00:49:38,108 --> 00:49:42,312
GOOD, SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE 

1704
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,181
POMPEO JUST LEFT, HAD A GREAT 

1705
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,683
MEETING, AND ALSO WAS IN CHINA, 

1706
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:48,985
AND SPOKE TO MANY OF THE ASIAN 

1707
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:53,824
LEADERS, WHO WENT THERE, A 

1708
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:54,991
REALLY GOOD MEETING WITH NORTH 

1709
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:58,895
KOREA, AND CHAIRMAN KIM, AND 

1710
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:00,630
PROGRESS ON SO MANY OTHER 

1711
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,300
FRONTS ALSO, AND THE WORLD IS 

1712
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,202
REALLY RESPECTING THE UNITED 

1713
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:06,903
STATES AGAIN, MUCH MORE SO THAN 

1714
00:50:06,903 --> 00:50:09,606
THEY HAVE IN MANY DECADES. 

1715
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:10,640
WE ARE RESPECTED AGAIN, THAT I 

1716
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:15,312
CAN TELL YOU, VERY MUCH 

1717
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:16,012
RESPECTED AGAIN, PEOPLE WANT TO 

1718
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:18,515
BE ON OUR SIDE, EVEN IF YOU 

1719
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,184
LOOK AT THE VOTES IN THE UNITED 

1720
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,120
NATIONS, WE ARE GETTING VERY 

1721
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,721
STRONG VOTES NOW. 

1722
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:27,323
I WANT TO THINK NIKKI, THIS 

1723
00:50:27,323 --> 00:50:29,459
WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO 

1724
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:31,027
DO IT, BECAUSE WHEN YOU WRITE 

1725
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:32,095
OUT ON A PIECE PAPER, THAT 

1726
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:36,933
INVESTOR NIKKI HALEY WILL BE 

1727
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:39,703
LEAVING, WHEN YOU REALLY THINK 

1728
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,906
SOMEBODY HAS DONE A TERRIFIC 

1729
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:49,512
JOB, IS TO THINK THE INVESTOR, 

1730
00:50:49,512 --> 00:50:52,081
I JUST WANT TO THINK NIKKI, 

1731
00:50:52,081 --> 00:50:57,220
OKAY? 

1732
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,890
IT'S A GREAT POSITION, SHE 

1733
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:04,494
REALIZES IT, AND SHE HAS HELPED 

1734
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:05,428
MAKE IT A MUCH BETTER POSITION, 

1735
00:51:05,428 --> 00:51:12,235
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH, 

1736
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,236
IT HAS BECOME MAY BE A MORE 

1737
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,104
GLAMOROUS POSITION THAN IT WAS 

1738
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,138
TWO YEARS AGO, I WONDER WHY, 

1739
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:16,706
BUT IT IS, SHE HAS MADE IT A 

1740
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:17,273
GLAMOROUS POSITION, SHE HAS 

1741
00:51:17,273 --> 00:51:18,207
MADE IT A MORE IMPORTANT 

1742
00:51:18,207 --> 00:51:23,046
POSITION, SO WE HAVE -- I CAN 

1743
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:25,615
ALMOST SAY MANY PEOPLE THAT 

1744
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,717
WANT TO DO, THEY ARE VERY GOOD 

1745
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:29,186
PEOPLE, I WILL BE TALKING ALSO 

1746
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:32,689
TO NIKKI ABOUT THAT, THE 

1747
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,257
GENERAL ABOUT THAT, WE HAVE 

1748
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,758
MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE VERY 

1749
00:51:35,758 --> 00:51:41,098
INTERESTED IN DOING IT.

1750
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,133
>> WITH MIKE POMPEO, ARE YOU 

1751
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:44,668
FRUSTRATED BY THE LACK OF 

1752
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:45,235
ACTUAL ANNOUNCEMENTS?>> NOT 

1753
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:48,572
ONLY AM I NOT FRUSTRATED, IT'S 

1754
00:51:48,572 --> 00:51:54,077
INCREDIBLE, WHO ARE YOU WITH?

1755
00:51:54,077 --> 00:52:00,817
>> FRIENDS.

1756
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:03,153
>> FOR 80 YEARS WE COULD DO A 

1757
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:04,253
THING, WE ARE IN THREE MONTHS 

1758
00:52:04,253 --> 00:52:04,788
OF NEGOTIATION, IT'S 

1759
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,189
RIDICULOUS, AS I'VE SAID ABOUT 

1760
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:08,325
THOUSAND TIMES, YOU HAVE NO 

1761
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:09,960
RUCKUS FLYING, NO MISSILES 

1762
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,763
FLYING, NO NUCLEAR TESTING, YOU 

1763
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:14,898
HAVE NUCLEAR CLOSINGS, CLOSING 

1764
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:17,100
UP DIFFERENT AREAS OF NORTH 

1765
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,502
KOREA, WE ARE GETTING REMAINS 

1766
00:52:19,502 --> 00:52:25,976
BACK, OF OUR GREAT HEROES, WE 

1767
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,043
GOT OUR HOSTAGES BACK, AND I 

1768
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:28,011
DIDN'T PAY ONE $.8 BILLION LIKE 

1769
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:28,912
THE PREVIOUS A MINISTRATION, I 

1770
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:29,312
PAID NOTHING. 

1771
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,648
BUT I HAVE AGREED TO MEET, AND 

1772
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:36,219
I HAVE AGREED TO SPEND TIME, 

1773
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:37,287
BUT HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE 

1774
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:38,855
WE LEFT SINGAPORE, ABOUT THREE 

1775
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:44,427
MONTHS OR SO, AND PEOPLE SAY, 

1776
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:45,461
THE MEDIA SAYS, HOW CAN WE BE 

1777
00:52:45,461 --> 00:52:46,128
NEGATIVE, HE'S DONE REALLY 

1778
00:52:46,128 --> 00:52:47,797
WELL, ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED WITH 

1779
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:49,766
THIS, I THINK THE SPEED IS 

1780
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,434
AMAZING, NO NUCLEAR TEST, NO 

1781
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:54,838
ROCKETS, A VERY GOOD RELATION 

1782
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:59,776
-- RELATIONSHIP WITH CHAIRMAN 

1783
00:52:59,776 --> 00:53:00,944
KIM, I LIKE HIM, HE LIKES ME, 

1784
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,213
THE RELATIONSHIP IS GOOD, MIKE 

1785

POMPEO HAD A VERY GOOD MEETING, 

1786
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:08,185
I SPOKE TO THEM AT LENGTH 

1787
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,920
YESTERDAY, HE WILL BE BACK 

1788
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,889
TONIGHT, AND SO I MEAN, JUST 

1789
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,391
THE OPPOSITE, I THINK WE HAVE 

1790
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,126
MADE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS. 

1791
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:16,593
INCREDIBLE. 

1792
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:20,764
SOME OF THE PRESS, COVERS IT 

1793
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:24,968
ACCURATELY AND RIGHT, BUT SOME 

1794
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:27,404
OF IT DOESN'T.

1795
00:53:27,404 --> 00:53:28,772
>> DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS 

1796
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:29,639
OPPORTUNITY TO LET US KNOW WHEN 

1797
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:33,176
YOUR NEXT MEETING WITH KIM WILL 

1798
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:33,342
BE? 

1799
00:53:33,342 --> 00:53:34,577
>> WE ARE SETTING THIS UP NOW, 

1800
00:53:34,577 --> 00:53:36,279
THAT WAS PART OF THE REASON 

1801
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:39,382
MIKE WAS GOING OVER TO MEET, WE 

1802
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:39,949
WILL BE ANNOUNCING THAT 

1803
00:53:39,949 --> 00:53:41,116
PROBABLY AT A DIFFERENT 

1804
00:53:41,116 --> 00:53:44,154
LOCATION, SINGAPORE WAS 

1805
00:53:44,154 --> 00:53:45,221
FANTASTIC, BUT WE PROBABLY WILL 

1806
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,790
DO A DIFFERENT LOCATION.>> MAR-

1807
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:48,958
A-LAGO?

1808
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:53,663
>> HE PROBABLY WOULD LIKE THAT, 

1809
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:54,864
I LIKE THAT, TOO, WE WILL TALK 

1810
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:55,632
ABOUT THREE OR FOUR LOCATIONS, 

1811
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:58,535
TIMING WILL BE FAR AWAY. 

1812
00:53:58,535 --> 00:53:59,302
PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THE 

1813
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:01,104
IMPORTANCE OF THE FIRST MEETING,

1814
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:09,079
WE SAID POINT NUMBER 1, 

1815
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,281
DENUCLEARIZATION, THEY HAVE 

1816
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:12,414
AGREED TO THAT, THEY CONTINUE 

1817
00:54:12,414 --> 00:54:14,984
TO, AND WE HAVEN'T REMOVED 

1818
00:54:14,984 --> 00:54:18,287
SANCTIONS, PEOPLE SAID WOULD'VE 

1819
00:54:18,287 --> 00:54:20,924
WE DONE, WE DON'T HAVE 

1820
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,393
SANCTIONS REMOVED, I WOULD LOVE 

1821
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:24,961
TO, BUT WE HAVE TO GET 

1822
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:29,733
SOMETHING FOR THAT.

1823
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:31,034
>> ANY CHANCE IT WILL BE ON 

1824
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:31,334
U.S. SOIL? 

1825
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:32,234
>> I DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS 

1826
00:54:32,234 --> 00:54:33,002
ANYBODY BASKING, EVENTUALLY WE 

1827
00:54:33,002 --> 00:54:34,971
WILL HAVE LOTS OF MEETINGS ON 

1828
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:36,106
U.S. SOIL, AND ON THEIR SOIL BY 

1829
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:40,410
THE WAY, A TWO WE -- A TWO-WAY 

1830
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:41,411
STREET. 

1831
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:49,919
I THINK THE COUNTRY OF NORTH 

1832
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:50,720
KOREA WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL 

1833
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,921
COUNTRY, I THINK IT WILL BE 

1834
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:52,555
INCREDIBLY ECONOMIC SUCCESSFUL, 

1835
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:54,524
I WANT TO MAKE IT THAT WAY, I 

1836
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:55,425
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD, 

1837
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:56,726
OTHER COUNTRIES, OTHER PEOPLE, 

1838
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:59,963
ENTREPRENEURS, BANKS, I WILL 

1839
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:00,830
TELL YOU, THEY ARE CALLING 

1840
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:02,465
WANTING TO GO THERE AND INVEST 

1841
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:02,932
AT SOME POINT. 

1842
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:05,201
WHEN CHAIRMAN KIM MAKES THAT 

1843
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:07,070
DECISION, I THINK HE WILL 

1844
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,404
UNLEASH SOMETHING THAT WILL BE 

1845
00:55:08,404 --> 00:55:13,610
SPECTACULAR. 

1846
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,411
REALLY SPECTACULAR, AND I THINK 

1847
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:15,745
HE KNOWS IT, AND I THINK THAT'S 

1848
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:16,846
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE ARE 

1849
00:55:16,846 --> 00:55:17,279
HAVING SUCCESSFUL 

1850
00:55:17,279 --> 00:55:18,081
CONVERSATIONS, I THINK HE WANTS 

1851
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:21,918
TO GET ON WITH IT.>> WHEN WILL 

1852
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:26,122
A SUCCESSOR BE NAMED?

1853
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:30,960
>> I A WILL SAY WE WILL NAME A 

1854
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,429
SUCCESSOR WITHIN THE NEXT TWO 

1855
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:34,431
OR THREE WEEKS. 

1856
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,866
MAY BE SOONER. 

1857
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:38,901
>> HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO THE 

1858
00:55:38,901 --> 00:55:41,504
SAUDI'S?

1859
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:45,075
>> I HAVE NOT BUT I WILL BE.

1860
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:54,150
>> WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO 

1861
00:55:54,150 --> 00:56:01,658
HILLARY CLINTON SAYING THAT 

1862
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:02,459
JUDGE KAVANAUGH SWEARINGEN WAS 

1863
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:03,827
MORE OF A POLITICAL STATEMENT 

1864
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:07,330
THAN A CEREMONIAL ONE? 

1865
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:08,465
>> HILLARY NEVER GOT IT, AND 

1866
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,333
THAT IS WHY SHE LOST.

1867
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:16,206
>> WHAT IS YOUR PREDICTION FOR 

1868
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:16,473
THE GOP? 

1869
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:18,041
HOW IS YOUR STAMINA FOR THE 

1870
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:18,942
CAMPAIGN TRAIL? 

1871
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:24,914
>> IF THERE IS A 5% DROP OFF, 

1872
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:25,514
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH 

1873
00:56:25,514 --> 00:56:26,282
THE PRESIDENT, YOU WOULD SAY, 

1874
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:27,383
BUT I'M GOING TO IOWA TONIGHT, 

1875
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:28,585
WE HAVE A BIG CROWD, I'M GOING 

1876
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:29,485
TO MAKE A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT 

1877
00:56:29,485 --> 00:56:31,387
TONIGHT AND I WOULD. 

1878
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:33,156
WE ARE GOING TO BE MAKING A 

1879
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:34,157
VERY BIG ANNOUNCEMENT, AND I 

1880
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:41,364
HAVE TO SAY, THE FARMERS, ARE 

1881
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:48,972
ARE SO THRILLED WITH THE USMCA, 

1882
00:56:48,972 --> 00:56:51,774
I DON'T SEE NAFTA, WE LOST 

1883
00:56:51,774 --> 00:56:52,942
THOUSANDS OF FACTORIES AND 

1884
00:56:52,942 --> 00:57:01,083
PLANTS, BAD FOR FARMERS, IT'S 

1885
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:02,218
ONLY GONE DOWN, THEY ARE GOING 

1886
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:03,453
TO GO UP, WE OPENED UP MEXICO, 

1887
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:05,188
WE'LL PUT UP CANADA, AND IT IS 

1888
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:09,893
GREAT FOR OUR FARMERS. 

1889
00:57:09,893 --> 00:57:11,060
BUT I'M GOING TO I WOULD 

1890
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:11,961
TONIGHT, AND WE WILL BE TALKING 

1891
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:16,366
A LITTLE ETHANOL TONIGHT, GOT 

1892
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:16,966
SOME GREAT THINGS PLANNED. 

1893
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:21,804
SPEAKING OF THAT, I WILL SAY, 

1894
00:57:21,804 --> 00:57:22,839
IF YOU LOOK AT INDUSTRIES, THE 

1895
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:23,740
STEEL INDUSTRY IN THIS COUNTRY 

1896
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,707
IS BACK LIKE NOTHING I'VE EVER 

1897
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:25,040
SEEN BEFORE. 

1898
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,175
IN A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS, 

1899
00:57:26,175 --> 00:57:27,610
SINCE WE STARTED DOING WHAT 

1900
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,847
WE'VE BEEN DOING, THE STEEL 

1901
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:34,717
INDUSTRY HAS LITERALLY REVIVED, 

1902
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:39,088
IT PLANS, OPENING UP, IN OUR 

1903
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:42,692
COUNTRY IT IS REALLY HOT, IT 

1904
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:43,560
HAS REALLY BEEN GREAT, I WILL 

1905
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:47,263
BE GOING TO IOWA TONIGHT.

1906
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:50,967
>> HOW DID THE MEETING WITH 

1907
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:56,806
MIKE POMPEO GO WITH CHINA? 

1908
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,374
>> VERY WELL, THEY TOOK $500 

1909
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:01,778
BILLION EVERY YEAR, PEOPLE 

1910
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:02,545
SHOULD'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 

1911
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:04,147
THIS IN THE CHAIR FOR MANY 

1912
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,250
YEARS, -- $500 MILLION. 

1913
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:13,022
THEY WERE TAKING OUT EVEN 200 

1914
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:14,390
BILLION, $300 BILLION AND $400 

1915
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,959
BILLION PER YEAR, WE HOPE TO 

1916
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:18,227
REBUILD CHINA, IF WE DIDN'T DO 

1917
00:58:18,227 --> 00:58:21,197
THAT, THEY ARE NOT WHERE THEY 

1918
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:22,332
WOULD BE, BUT WE ARE NOT DOING 

1919
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:25,234
IT ANY LONGER.

1920
00:58:25,234 --> 00:58:29,606
>> ARE YOU GOING FORWARD WITH 

1921
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:29,906
THE TEARS? 

1922
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:31,140
>> WHAT DOES RETALIATE MEAN? 

1923
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:35,178
THEY'VE ALREADY RETALIATED, 

1924
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:35,911
THEY'VE TAKEN OUT $500 BILLION, 

1925
00:58:35,911 --> 00:58:38,281
THAT IS THE ULTIMATE 

1926
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:39,349
RETALIATION, CHINA WANTS TO 

1927
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,217
MAKE A DEAL, AND I SAY THEY ARE 

1928
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:42,251
NOT READY YET. 

1929
00:58:42,251 --> 00:58:43,753
I JUST SAY THEY'RE NOT READY 

1930
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:47,624
YET. 

1931
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:48,758
WE HAVE CANCELED A COUPLE OF 

1932
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:49,392
MEETINGS, BECAUSE I SAY THEY 

1933
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:51,728
ARE NOT READY TO MAKE A DEAL, 

1934
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:52,628
WE CAN'T HAVE A ONE-WAY STREET, 

1935
00:58:52,628 --> 00:58:58,234
IT'S GOT TO BE A TWO-WAY STREET,

1936
00:58:58,234 --> 00:58:59,335
IT'S BEEN A ONE-WAY STREET FOR 

1937
00:58:59,335 --> 00:59:00,637
25 YEARS, WE'VE GOT TO MAKE IT 

1938
00:59:00,637 --> 00:59:01,738
A TWO-WAY STREET, WE'VE GOT TO 

1939
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:02,539

00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:09,646
THE PURE REASON FOR THIS IS 

1944
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:10,880
NIKKI, YOU HAVE BEEN FANTASTIC,

HALEY, WHO JUST RESIGNED TODAY,

MUCH PRAISE BETWEEN THE TWO, 

1967
01:00:06,602 --> 01:00:07,704
BUT SOMETHING THAT STOOD OUT TO 

1968
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:08,471
ME WAS WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP 

1969
01:00:08,471 --> 01:00:09,572
SAID TO NIKKI, MAYBE YOU WILL 

1970
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:12,809

PICK? 

1973

>> QUITE A TEASE THERE, THIS 

1974
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:22,551
WAS A VERY DIGNIFIED DEPARTURE, 

1975
01:00:22,551 --> 01:00:23,553
EVERYONE THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE 

1976
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:26,222
A VICTORY LAP FOR THE PRESIDENT,

1977
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:27,189
AFTER SWEARING IN HIS SECOND 

1978
01:00:27,189 --> 01:00:28,424
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, BUT THE 

1979
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:33,930

1980
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:34,797
WAS GOING TO TENDER HER 

1981
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,966
RESIGNATION, AND IN A HASTILY 

1982
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:39,068
ARRANGED PRESS CONFERENCE, THEY 

1983
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:41,170
COULD HAVE A DIGNIFIED 

1984
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:45,141
DEPARTURE, HE CALLED HER 

1985
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,209
FANTASTIC, HE SAID SHE HAD DONE 

1986
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:47,210
A INCREDIBLE JOB, AND THEIR 

1987
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,878
STORY IS THAT SHE SAID ABOUT 

1988
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:53,883
SIX MONTHS AGO THAT SHE WANTED 

1989
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:54,751
TO DEPART, BUT NOT UNTIL THE 

1990
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:55,985
END OF THE YEAR, SHE WANTED TO 

1991
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:56,986
DEPART AT ABOUT THE TWO-YEAR 

1992
01:00:56,986 --> 01:01:02,391
MARK, AND HE SAID HE WILL 

1993
01:01:02,391 --> 01:01:03,025
ANNOUNCE HER SUCCESSOR IN TWO 

1994
01:01:03,025 --> 01:01:04,127
OR THREE WEEKS, BUT ONE BIG 

1995
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,528
POINT IS, SHE IS NOT 

1996
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:07,029
CAMPAIGNING, SO SHE SAYS, IN 

1997
01:01:07,029 --> 01:01:09,699
2020, AND WILL BE SUPPORTING 

1998
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:10,967
THE PRESIDENT AND CAMPAIGNING 

1999
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:15,638
ON HIS BEHALF, THIS IS ONE OF 

2000
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:17,073
THE ONLY HIGH PROFILE WOMEN IN 

2001
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:19,909
THE PRESIDENT'S CABINET.>> AND 

2002
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:24,947
I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR TAKE ON 

2003
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:29,452
THIS, CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS, SHE 

2004
01:01:29,452 --> 01:01:30,452
SAYS SHE HAS BEEN WORKING FOR 

2005
01:01:30,452 --> 01:01:31,354
EIGHT YEARS, WITH A VERY 

2006
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,189
INTENSE RUN, GOVERNOR OF SOUTH 

2007
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:38,127
CAROLINA,  TWO YEARS AT THE UN, 

2008
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:39,061
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT? 

2009
01:01:39,061 --> 01:01:39,628
BECAUSE THE TIMING IS 

2010
01:01:39,628 --> 01:01:40,363
INTERESTING, SHE TALKED ABOUT 

2011
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,397
HOW LONG SHE HAS BEEN IN 

2012
01:01:41,397 --> 01:01:42,532
POLITICS, THIS KIND OF JOB IS 

2013
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:47,503
EXTREMELY STRENUOUS, NOT ONLY IN

2014
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:48,805
TERMS OF THE ACTUAL TIME, BUT 

2015
01:01:48,805 --> 01:01:49,338
THE PLAYERS INVOLVED, AND 

2016
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:50,239
BECOMING A PROFESSIONAL ON THE 

2017
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:52,909
ISSUE OF FOREIGN POLICY WHEN YOU

2018
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:54,577
ARE A FORMER GOVERNOR, A LOT 

2019
01:01:54,577 --> 01:01:58,948
SHE HAS DONE, AND SHE TICKED 

2020
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:00,149
OFF A LIST OF WHAT SHE BELIEVES 

2021
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:07,190
TO BE HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS, BUT 

2022
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:08,391
WE ARE COMING RIGHT OFF THE 

2023
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,025
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION THAT THE 

2024
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:09,792
PRESIDENT WANTS TO USE AS A 

2025
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:10,760
SELLING POINT IN THE MIDTERMS, 

2026
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,627
CONTINUING TO RALLY THE TROOPS 

2027
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:12,628
AROUND REPUBLICANS, AND A MONTH 

2028
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:15,932
AWAY FROM THE MIDTERMS, SO 

2029
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:26,175
HAVING THIS KIND OF SHAKEUP IN 

2030
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:27,043
THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOT 

2031
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:27,744
SOMETHING THAT TYPICALLY AN 

2032
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:28,611
ADMINISTRATION WOULD ONE JUST A 

2033
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:29,445
MONTH BEFORE THE MIDTERMS, SO 

2034
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:30,312
IT DOES RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT 

2035
01:02:30,312 --> 01:02:31,814
WHY NOW, WHY NOT DO IT A FEW 

2036
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:32,682
WEEKS FROM NOW ONCE THE 

2037
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:36,919
MIDTERMS ARE OVER, ESPECIALLY 

2038
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:40,289
SINCE SHE SAID SHE WAS TO STAY 

2039
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:41,557
IN OF THE YEAR, BUT SHE SAID 

2040
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:45,027
SHE'S NOT GOING TO CHALLENGE 

2041
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:45,928
THE PRESIDENT, SHE PLANS TO 

2042
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,730
CAMPAIGN FOR HIM IN 2020, BUT 

2043
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:51,234
WE CAN'T ASSUME SHE WON'T BE 

2044
01:02:51,234 --> 01:02:54,370
AROUND POLITICS FOR A WHILE.

2045
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:55,204
>> THAT WAS THE HEADLINE, SHE 

2046
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:56,272
WILL CAMPAIGN FOR HIM IN 2020. 

2047
01:02:56,272 --> 01:03:00,276
ON THE PHONE IS LESLIE SANCHEZ, 

2048
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:04,080
WEIGH IN HERE, WHAT ARE YOUR 

2049
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,748
THOUGHTS AFTER LISTENING TO 

2050
01:03:05,748 --> 01:03:07,950
THIS, AND ALSO ABOUT HALEY'S 

2051
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:10,953
POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS?

2052
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:14,223
>> I THINK KAITLIN HAS IT 

2053
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:18,861
EXACTLY RIGHT, TIME IS ON NIKKI 

2054
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:20,263
HALEY SIDE, NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF 

2055
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:21,764
THE OPENING IT WILL CREATE IN 

2056
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:25,201
THE STATE, BUT SHE SAID A FEW 

2057
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:25,868
INTERESTING THINGS, ASIDE FROM 

2058
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:27,937
A VERY GRACIOUS EXIT, THAT HAS 

2059
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:30,940
THE PRESENCE PRAISE, AND THAT 

2060
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:35,244
IN ITSELF DESERVES A GOLD 

2061
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:35,978
RIBON, AND THAT IS PRETTY 

2062
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:36,946
DIFFICULT TO GET, SHE SAID I 

2063
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:37,847
BELIEVE IN TERM LIMITS, COMING 

2064
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:40,383
FROM A STATE WHERE THE LATE 

2065
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:41,150
STROM THURMOND WAS A SENATOR 

2066
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:44,587
FOR 48 YEARS, THAT NEVER 

2067
01:03:44,587 --> 01:03:48,191
CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY TO 

2068
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:49,225
ADVANCE IN THE STATE, SHE GREW 

2069
01:03:49,225 --> 01:03:50,126
UP IN A STATE THAT 

2070
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:50,726
FUNDAMENTALLY SHE UNDERSTOOD 

2071
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:51,694
YOU HAVE TO CREATE 

2072
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:53,195
OPPORTUNITIES, AND SHE MAKES 

2073
01:03:53,195 --> 01:03:56,432
THE POINT TO SAY YOU ARE 

2074
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:57,066
SELFLESS ENOUGH TO EXIT, THAT 

2075
01:03:57,066 --> 01:04:01,637
IS A VERY HARD THING, 

2076
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:02,137
ESPECIALLY WITH SOMEONE 

2077
01:04:02,137 --> 01:04:05,174
WIELDING SUCH TREMENDOUS 

2078
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,842
POLITICAL POWER, IT SPEAKS TO 

2079
01:04:06,842 --> 01:04:07,710
HER TENACITY, HER VISION, AND 

2080
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:10,512
WHERE SHE IS AIMING, SHE IS 

2081
01:04:10,512 --> 01:04:12,582
SOMEONE WHO CAN MAKE VERY TOUGH 

2082
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:13,950
CHOICES FOR HER FAMILY AND 

2083
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:15,718
STAND STRONG, AND SHE WAS THE 

2084
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:18,054
ONE WHO HAD TO DEFEND THE 

2085
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:18,988
PRESIDENT DURING THE PARIS 

2086
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:22,391
ACCORD, AND STILL MANAGES TO 

2087
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:25,328
SAY THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL,

2088
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:26,963
IT WAS THESE POLITICAL ISSUES 

2089
01:04:26,963 --> 01:04:27,863
WITH OPPORTUNITY, SHE MANAGES 

2090
01:04:27,863 --> 01:04:30,333
TO COME OUT AHEAD, SHE IS 

2091
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,802
DEFINITELY ONE TO WATCH.

2092
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:38,274
>> KYLIE, WE HEARD HIM SAY HE 

2093
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:39,041
WILL NAME A SUCCESSOR WITHIN 

2094
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,009
THE NEXT TWO OR THREE WEEKS 

2095
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:40,910
BEFORE THE MIDTERMS, WHAT STOOD 

2096
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:42,645
OUT TO YOU DURING THAT MEETING 

2097
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:45,214
BETWEEN THE TWO?>> I THINK 

2098
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,883
PAULA PUT IT WELL WHEN SHE 

2099
01:04:47,883 --> 01:04:56,125
TALKED ABOUT HOW WELL THIS ONE 

2100
01:04:56,125 --> 01:05:00,062
FOR EACH OTHER, THEY WERE 

2101
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,197
ADORNING EACH OTHER WITH 

2102
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:02,464
OMPLIMENTS, A WELL 

2103
01:05:02,464 --> 01:05:10,906
ORCHESTRATED EXIT, I THINK THIS 

2104
01:05:10,906 --> 01:05:11,774
SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO NIKKI 

2105
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:12,374
HALEY'S POLITICAL ACUMEN, SHE 

2106
01:05:12,374 --> 01:05:13,542
KNOWS HOW TO WORK THIS, AND NOT 

2107
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:14,610
MAKE IT SEEM LIKE THERE IS ANY 

2108
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:15,611
BAD BLOOD BETWEEN THE TWO, SO 

2109
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:16,345
SHE CAN PUSH FORWARD 

2110
01:05:16,345 --> 01:05:16,712
INDEPENDENTLY. 

2111
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:20,182
THE BIG QUESTION IS, WHAT IS 

2112
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:21,183
SHE GOING TO DO, AND WHO IS 

2113
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:22,251
GOING TO STEP INTO THIS ROLE? 

2114
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,720
I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT ONE 

2115
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:25,988
NAME THAT WILL BE FLOATED OUT 

2116
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:27,957
THERE IS THE FORMER DEPUTY 

2117
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:30,059
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR DENA 

2118
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,561
POWELL, SHE LEFT THE 

2119
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:34,697
ADMINISTRATION AFTER SERVING IN 

2120
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:35,631
THE DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY 

2121
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:39,802
ROLE FOR A YEAR, AND THEN SHE 

2122
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:44,940
WENT BACK TO GOLDMAN SACHS, BUT 

2123
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:45,741
SHE HAS STILL REMAINED A CLOSE 

2124
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:47,043
ALLY OF THE PRESIDENT, AND WHEN 

2125
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:48,044
SHE LEFT, THERE WERE ALSO 

2126
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:50,079
POSITIVE WORDS THRUST ON HER. 

2127
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,981
TRUMP AT THAT POINT SAID THAT 

2128
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:54,717
SHE HAD SAGE ADVICE, SHE HAD 

2129
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:57,186
BEEN AN INVALUABLE MEMBER OF 

2130
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:59,087
THE TEAM, AND WE JUST SAW ON 

2131
01:05:59,087 --> 01:06:00,923
TWITTER, THAT NIKKI HALEY OVER 

2132
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:02,825
THE WEEKEND SPENT THE WEEKEND 

2133
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:04,660
IN SOUTH CAROLINA, AND WHO WAS 

2134
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:04,893
THERE? 

2135
01:06:04,893 --> 01:06:10,666
DENA POWELL. 

2136
01:06:10,666 --> 01:06:11,567
SOMEONE TO KEEP AN EYE ON. 

2137
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:12,701
>> I KNOW YOU WORKED WITH DENA 

2138
01:06:12,701 --> 01:06:15,204
POWELL, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING? 

2139
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:16,639
>> HER NAME HAS ALWAYS BEEN 

2140
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:17,506
FLOATED AROUND, SHE IS ONE OF 

2141
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:18,173
THE MOST RESPECTED, HIGHLY 

2142
01:06:18,173 --> 01:06:22,011
REGARDED WOMEN IN POLITICS, 

2143
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:23,679
BECAUSE OF HER KIND OF FOREIGN 

2144
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:26,015
AFFAIRS ACUMEN, BUT ALSO 

2145
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:26,949
SOMEONE WHO REALLY KNOWS HOW TO 

2146
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:31,987
GET THINGS DONE, AND BRINGS 

2147
01:06:31,987 --> 01:06:32,721
TOGETHER INFLUENCERS TO MAKE 

2148
01:06:32,721 --> 01:06:33,722
CHANGE, SHE DID IT IN THE 

2149
01:06:33,722 --> 01:06:35,624
GOVERNMENT TO BRING IN -- BY 

2150
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:46,702
BRING IN PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHO MAY 

2151
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:47,870
NOT HAVE WANTED TO WORK IN THE 

2152
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:48,771
BUSH MINISTRATION, SHE BROUGHT 

2153
01:06:48,771 --> 01:06:49,438
THEM IN, SO THE PRESIDENT WOULD 

2154
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:54,643
HAVE A BROAD ARRAY OF IDEAS 

2155
01:06:54,643 --> 01:06:55,544
THAT WERE COUNTER TO THE 

2156
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:56,011
PRESIDENTS THINKING. 

2157
01:06:56,011 --> 01:06:56,979
AND AT GOLDMAN SACHS, SHE HAD A 

2158
01:06:56,979 --> 01:06:58,347
MASSIVE CAPACITY TO BRING WOMEN 

2159
01:06:58,347 --> 01:06:59,115
TOGETHER TO LOOK AT ISSUES 

2160
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:00,983
BEYOND CULTURAL AFFAIRS, BUT 

2161
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:04,987
ECONOMIC ISSUES, KIND OF 

2162
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:05,621
EMPOWERMENT ISSUES, ACCESS TO 

2163
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:07,089
CAPITAL, A VARIETY OF THINGS, 

2164
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:10,359
SO SHE IS A REAL POWERHOUSE 

2165
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:11,627
THAT YOU ALWAYS WANT TO KEEP IN 

2166
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:14,329
THE BACK OF YOUR MIND, AND 

2167
01:07:14,329 --> 01:07:15,297
ANYONE WOULD BE EXCITED TO HAVE 

2168
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:18,734
HER FOR A SPOT.

2169
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:19,735
>> SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM SENT 

2170
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:20,969
OUT A STATEMENT SAYING THAT 

2171
01:07:20,969 --> 01:07:23,806
AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY HAS DONE 

2172
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:28,177
AN OUTSTANDING JOB AS UNITED

STATES AMBASSADOR, SHOWING A 

2174
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:33,349
LEVEL OF EFFECTIVENESS RARELY 

2175
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:34,316
SEEN BY SOMEONE IN THIS 

2176
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:36,085
POSITION, AS WE REPORTED, IT 

2177
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:37,186
WAS DIGNIFIED, NIKKI HALEY WAS 

2178
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:38,320
EXTREMELY GRACIOUS, AND 

2179
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,321
FRIENDLY. 

2180
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:47,163
PAULA REID, WHEN WAS THE LAST 

2181
01:07:47,163 --> 01:07:47,963
TIME YOU SAW PRESIDENT TRUMP 

2182
01:07:47,963 --> 01:07:49,198
KEEP THIS AMOUNT OF PRAISE ON 

2183
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:49,465
SOMEONE? 

2184
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:57,840
>> WE KEEP USING THIS TERM 

2185
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:58,474
DIGNIFIED DEPARTURE, BUT THIS 

2186
01:07:58,474 --> 01:07:59,475
WAS GREAT FOR NIKKI HALEY, SHE 

2187
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:00,342
AVOIDED BEING FIRED BY TWEET, 

2188
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:01,177
HAVING INSULTS LOBBED AT HER 

2189
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:01,811
DIRECTION, PUBLIC UNDERCUTTING, 

2190
01:08:01,811 --> 01:08:03,078
THIS GAVE HER AN OPPORTUNITY TO 

2191
01:08:03,078 --> 01:08:05,381
HEAP PRAISE ON THE PRESIDENT, A 

2192
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:09,085
FULL THROATED DEFENSE OF THEIR 

2193
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:12,354
AGENDA, SHE SAID THE U.S. IS 

2194
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:13,389
RESPECTED, OTHER COUNTRIES MAY 

2195
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:15,090
NOT LIKE WHAT WE DO, BUT THEY 

2196
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:18,560
RESPECTED, THE U.S. IS STRONG 

2197
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,095
AGAIN, AND WENT DOWN THE ENTIRE 

2198
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,095
TRUMP FAMILY TREE, PRAISING 

2199
01:08:21,095 --> 01:08:25,334

IVANKA TRUMP, SHE MENTIONED ALL 

2202
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,112
OF THEM, THEY ARE ALL GETTING 

2203
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,680
PRAISE AND AN ENDORSEMENT FROM 

2204
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:41,050
THE OTHER, THE PRESIDENT IS 

2205
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:41,850
GETTING A ENDORSEMENT FROM 

2206
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:44,019
NIKKI HALEY, ONE OF THE FEW 

2207
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:44,653
HIGH-PROFILE WOMEN, AND SHE 

2208
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:48,490
PROMISED I WON'T RUN AGAINST 

2209
01:08:48,490 --> 01:08:49,691
YOU IN 2020, IN FACT I WILL BE 

2210
01:08:49,691 --> 01:08:51,426
ON THE CAMPAIGN STAGE RIGHT 

2211
01:08:51,426 --> 01:08:53,095
NEXT TO YOU. 

2212
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:57,899
>> HOW DOES THAT FACTOR INTO 

2213
01:08:57,899 --> 01:08:58,934
FIRING UP THE BASE EVEN MORE? 

2214
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:07,475
>> IT IS A GOOD QUESTION, ABOUT 

2215
01:09:07,475 --> 01:09:08,243
A MONTH AWAY FROM THOSE 

2216
01:09:08,243 --> 01:09:08,911
CRITICAL MIDTERM ELECTIONS, THE 

2217
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:09,979
PRESIDENT IS COMING OFF THE 

2218
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:10,613
KAVANAUGH APPOINTMENT, THEY ARE 

2219
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:11,514
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO 

2220
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:12,346
KEEP THE BASE STIMULATED, IF 

2221
01:09:12,346 --> 01:09:13,282
NIKKI HALEY WERE TO DEPART 

2222
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:14,750
UNDER UNFRIENDLY TERMS, THAT 

2223
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:16,218
WOULD SIGNIFY ADDITIONAL 

2224
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:17,618
TURMOIL, THERE WOULD NOT BE THE 

2225
01:09:17,618 --> 01:09:23,258
MESSAGE THAT YOU WANT TO SEND 

2226
01:09:23,258 --> 01:09:24,158
JUST WEEKS BEFORE A CRITICAL 

2227
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:24,926
ELECTION WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO 

2228
01:09:24,926 --> 01:09:25,761
MAKE THE CASE THAT REPUBLICANS 

2229
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:26,662
SHOULD BE IN CHARGE OF 

2230
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:26,962
GOVERNING. 

2231
01:09:26,962 --> 01:09:29,198
IT DOES RAISE SOME QUESTIONS 

2232
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:33,234
ABOUT WHY NOW, WHY NOT WAIT A 

2233
01:09:33,234 --> 01:09:34,202
FEW MORE WEEKS UNTIL AFTER THE 

2234
01:09:34,202 --> 01:09:35,203
MIDTERMS, BUT THE WAY IN WHICH 

2235
01:09:35,203 --> 01:09:35,871
THEY APPROACHED THIS SIGNAL 

2236
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,171
THAT THEY BOTH WANT TO MAKE THE 

2237
01:09:37,171 --> 01:09:38,807
TRANSITION AS SMOOTH AS 

2238
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:40,341
POSSIBLE, AND FOR SOMEONE LIKE 

2239
01:09:40,341 --> 01:09:42,111
NIKKI HALEY, TALKED ABOUT THE 

2240
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:47,515
IDEA THAT SHE HAS PRESUMABLY 

2241
01:09:47,515 --> 01:09:48,116
AMBITIONS BEYOND THIS POST, 

2242
01:09:48,116 --> 01:09:48,750
POTENTIALLY RUNNING FOR 

2243
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:50,919
PRESIDENT AT SOME POINT, 

2244
01:09:50,919 --> 01:09:53,221
REMEMBER SHE IS STILL VERY 

2245
01:09:53,221 --> 01:09:56,758
YOUNG, TO HAVE THAT PRAISE, TO 

2246
01:09:56,758 --> 01:09:57,426
LEAVE UNFRIENDLY TERMS FROM 

2247
01:09:57,426 --> 01:10:00,796
THIS WHITE HOUSE IS A KEY 

2248
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:01,797
CALLING CARD FOR WHATEVER SHE 

2249
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:02,598
WANTS TO DO IN REPUBLICAN 

2250
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:03,765
POLITICS, GIVEN THAT THE 

2251
01:10:03,765 --> 01:10:05,434
PRESIDENT IS STILL VERY POPULAR 

2252
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:08,003
AMONG REPUBLICANS, AND HE IS IN 

2253
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:09,038
CHARGE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY 

2254
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:09,938
AT THIS POINT. 

2255
01:10:09,938 --> 01:10:16,078
SO LEAVING ON GOOD TERMS IS 

2256
01:10:16,078 --> 01:10:16,645
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR HER. 

2257
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:18,180

2258
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:21,083
GRACIOUS.>> PAULA REID, KYLIE
