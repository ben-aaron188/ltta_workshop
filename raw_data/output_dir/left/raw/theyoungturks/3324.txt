1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,179
YESTERDAY'S MARQUEE RACE,

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:05,819
THE BIG ONE EVERYONE WAS
ANTICIPATING IT WAS THE

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,210
GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION
IN VIRGINIA.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:16,430
THE POLLS HAD TIGHTENED UP
NEAR THE END.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:23,789
IT ENDS UP THAT HE BEAT THE
POLLING, I THINK IT WAS

6
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,110
DOWN TO THREE OR FOUR POINTS AND
IT LOOKS LIKE HE WILL HIT A

7
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,850
LITTLE BIT SHY OF NINE POINTS.

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,121
IT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT
LOOK LIKE THINGS WERE

9
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:34,121
GETTING CLOSER.

10
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:36,090
IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE
GETTING CLOSER BECAUSE OF

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,270
GILLESPIE'S CHANGE ñ
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT SANCTUARY

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:44,060
CITIES WHICH I THOUGHT WAS
A NOVEL APPROACH.

13
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,510
THERE WAS FEARS THAT THAT COULD
FLIP THINGS, IT LOOKS LIKE

14
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:57,250
IT DIDN'T, IN FACT IT
ACTUALLY HURT HIM.

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,739
HE SEEMS TO MOST ACCURATELY BE
DESCRIBED AS A CENTRIST OR

16
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:04,430
OLD-SCHOOL VIRGINIA DEMOCRAT,
BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR

17
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,610
REASONS TO BE HOPEFUL.

18
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:14,420
HE PREVIOUSLY FOUGHT TO DEFEAT A
RIGHT TO WORK AMENDMENT, IT

19
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,750
HAS DESTROYED A LOT OF
STATES WORKERS RIGHTS.

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,670
HE WENT AGAINST MCCALL, THE
PREVIOUS DEMOCRATIC

21
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,700
GOVERNOR ON A MAJOR
PIPELINE PROJECT.

22
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,250
HE POSED HIS EXPANSION OF
CHARTER SCHOOLS AND HAS

23
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:40,680
ALSO SPOKEN ABOUT INSTITUTING A
CAP IN TRADE IN THE STATE.

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,330
IT GIVES YOU CAUSE FOR A
LITTLE BIT OF HOPE.

25
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,689
PREVIOUS VIRGINIA DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNORS HAVE BEEN ON THE

26
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,000
RIGHT SIDE OF THE PARTY EVEN
AMONGST DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,180
IT LOOKS LIKE HE COULD HAVE A
LITTLE BIT OF PROGRESS IN

28
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,180
THAT AREA.

29
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,380
BUT WE WILL SEE.

30
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,240
>>I HOPE SO.

31
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,409
>>YOU CAN'T JUST LET THEM GET
ELECTED AND THEN GO TO SLEEP.

32
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:01,659
>>HE VOTED TWICE FOR GEORGE W.
BUSH.

33
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:04,460
THAT IS WHAT MAKES ME
NERVOUS ABOUT THAT GUY.

34
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,100
>>I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF
GOOD REASONS TO BE NERVOUS.

35
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,939
>> A LOT OF REASONS, YES.

36
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:11,090
>>HE DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS
A CONSERVATIVE.

37
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:17,790
>>THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WERE AFRAID
IT WAS GOING TO BE CLOSE.

38
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,930
HE KIND OF BUCKLED ON SOME OF
THE SOCIAL ISSUES TOO.

39
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:33,239
THIS SHOWS YOU THAT TRUMP IS NOT
REALLY SALABLE TO PEOPLE.

40
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:35,389
WHAT TRUMP WAS SELLING IS
OUTSIDER IS HIM, NOW HE IS

41
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,049
NOT OUTSIDE ANYMORE.

42
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:46,060
>> YOU THINK GILLESPIE WAS
AN OUTSIDER?

43
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,620
>>NO.

44
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,230
THIS ALSO SHOWS THAT IF YOU
STICK TRUMP TO THE

45
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,389
CANDIDATE, YOU CAN BEAT THEM.

46
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:56,569
THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE PEOPLE
LIKE KEITH OLBERMANN AND

47
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:58,930
HILLARY CLINTON SAYING I
WISH FOR GEORGE W.

48
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,120
BUSH DAYS.

49
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,980
SO THEY ARE SEPARATING HIM FROM
THE REGULAR REPUBLICANS

50
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,840
WHICH IS A MISTAKE.

51
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,560
>> TRUMP DOES NOT REPRESENT
REPUBLICANS, SOMEONE LIKE

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
GEORGE W.

53
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,179
BUSH DOES.

54
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:26,199
>> HILLARY CLINTON 

55
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:29,079
DIDN'T GIVE A
SHIT AND SHE DID IT ANYWAY.

56
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,769
THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO,
STICK TRUMP TO THE

57
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:33,709
REPUBLICAN YOU ARE RUNNING
AGAINST, AND YOU HAVE TO

58
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:36,480
RUN ON ECONOMIC POPULIST IDEAS.

59
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,920
>>THERE

60
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,099
SEEMS TO BE AN ARGUMENT GOING ON
AMONGST RIGHT-WING POLITICIANS

61
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:48,239
ABOUT WHETHER THERE WAS NOT
ENOUGH TRUMP IN THIS RACE.

62
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,199
FIRST HERE IS VIDEO OF GILLESPIE
CONCEDING AFTER THE RESULTS

63
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,890
BECAME CLEAR.

64
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,879
>> I WANT TO SAY THAT WHILE
DISAPPOINTED AS MANY OF YOU

65
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:02,700
KNOW MY FAVORITE VERSES ROMANS
8:28,

66
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,799
FOR IN ALL THINGS WE KNOW ñ
FOR WE KNOW IN ALL THINGS THAT

67
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,889
ALL THINGS WORK FOR THE GOOD,
FOR THOSE WHO LOVE GOD AND

68
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:13,279
ARE CALLED TO SERVE
ACCORDING TO HIS PURPOSE.

69
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:17,670
I FELT CALLED TO SERVE, I HOPE
GOD WILL DISCERN WHAT HIS

70
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,850
CALLING IS FOR ME NEXT.

71
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:25,230
BUT I KNOW THIS, WHATEVER IT IS
AND WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE,

72
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:30,790
ONE KATHY GILLESPIE
WILL BE BY MY SIDE.

73
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:38,480
>>SO OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE TO HAVE
THE FAMILY IN THE BACKGROUND.

74
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,880
A COUPLE OF THOSE KIDS ARE
PROBABLY OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW

75
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,160
HOW THE RACE WENT.

76
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,200
THERE DAD RAN ON SANCTUARY
CITIES AND VILIFYING AND

77
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,070
DEMONIZING UNDOCUMENTED
IMMIGRANTS AND CONFEDERATE

78
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,070
MEMORIALS.

79
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:59,250
LIKE THAT GUY REALLY CARES
ABOUT CONFEDERATE MEMORIALS.

80
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:09,570
SO THIS IDEA THAT ñ IT IS SORT
OF THE CLASSIC REPUBLICAN

81
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:16,050
THING BUT IT BECAME
MORE VICIOUS.

82
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,240
THE IDEA IS HE ONE ON IT SO
MAYBE OTHER REPUBLICANS CAN.

83
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,230
I NEVER BOUGHT THAT EVEN
BACK BEFORE TRUMP ONE.

84
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,960
JUST BECAUSE TRUMP IS ABLE TO
SKATE BY, THE MEDIA CAN'T

85
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,261
PIN THINGS TO HIM THAT THE
VOTERS DON'T CARE, DOES IT

86
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:33,550
MEAN EVERY OTHER REPUBLICAN
WILL BE ABLE TO FLIP OFF

87
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,110
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS AND
GET ELECTED ON THAT.

88
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:42,160
>>FIRST OF ALL, I'M PRETTY SURE
HE FORGOT THE BIBLE VERSE

89
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,900
HE WAS TRYING TO QUOTE MIDWAY
AND JUST WENT WITH IT ANYWAY.

90
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:58,100
ACTUALLY READ THAT BOOK COVER
TO COVER BECAUSE YOLO.

91
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,150
TRUMP RAN ON THIS FAKE IDEA
OF A REPUBLICAN POPULIST.

92
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,680
IT WAS COMPLETE SNAKE OIL
BECAUSE IT IS A TOTAL OXYMORON.

93
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,050
BUT HE SOLD THE SNAKE OIL TO
ENOUGH PEOPLE TO WIN.

94
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,380
NOW YOU SEE THAT TRUMP IS
REPUBLICANISM, THAT IS WHAT

95
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,380
THIS IS.

96
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,300
ALL OF HIS POLICIES, ANY OTHER
REPUBLICAN WOULD BE BEHIND.

97
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,780
THAT IS WHY SO MANY OF
THEM APPROVE OF HIM.

98
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,460
WHAT DOES TRUMP LACK THAT MOST
OTHER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS

99
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,460
DIDN'T?

100
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,020
ANY SOURCE OF SUBTLETY.

101
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,290
THE BEST THING THE DEMOCRATS IN
ANY OPPOSITION CAN DO IS TO

102
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,980
MAKE SURE PEOPLE KNOW
THESE ARE SYNONYMOUS.

103
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:52,450
THE DIFFERENCE IS THIS GUY
TALKS A LITTLE MEANER.

104
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,750
>> GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT YOU WILL
END UP AS WHEN THE NEXT SET

105
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,170
OF ELECTIONS ROLL AROUND.

106
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,360
SOME PRESIDENTS IN THE PAST,
WHEN THEY HAVE GROWN

107
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,420
UNPOPULAR REALIZE THEY WOULD
HURT THEIR PARTY BY BEING

108
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,680
SEEN WITH THE CANDIDATES.

109
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,700
THEY HAVE THE SELF-AWARENESS
TO SORT OF BACK OFF.

110
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,060
I DON'T THINK TRUMP HAS.

111
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,340
HE WILL BACK OFF AFTER THEY
LOSE, HE WILL MOCK THEM AND

112
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,830
COME UP WITH AN INSULTING
NICKNAME.

113
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,800
SO IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS COME
AROUND, HE WILL BE ALL OVER

114
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
THE PLACE.

115
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,700
I THINK DEMOCRATS WILL TRY TO
STICK HIM TO THE REST OF

116
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,700
THE CANDIDATES.

117
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,240
BUT EVEN IF THEY DON'T I THINK
HE WILL.

118
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,450
>> I HOPE SO.

119
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:35,350
IT'S FUNNY AS GILLESPIE SAYS, I
ANSWERED THE CALL FROM GOD

120
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,380
TO RUN IN THIS RACE, IT TURNS
OUT GOD WAS WRONG ABOUT

121
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:51,909
THIS RACE TOO . I THINK GOD IS
WORKING FOR NATE SILVER.

122
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:57,070
>> ALSO GOD WANTED THE IRAQ WAR
AND GOT BEHIND TIM TEBOW.

123
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:07,690
>>GOD ALSO SUPPORTED 10 PEOPLE
IN THE LAST REPUBLICAN PRIMARY.

124
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:16,180
>> TRUMP DID WEIGH IN ON THE
RACE, HE TWEETED THIS.

125
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:25,660
>>THOSE EXTRA CHARACTERS MAN.

126
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:31,900
>>HE JUST LET ME GRAB
HIM RIGHT BY THE ñ

127
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:39,219
>> I AM REALLY DREADING THE
280 CHARACTER TWEET.

128
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,700
I DON'T KNOW IF THE COUNTRY IS
READY FOR IT.

129
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:52,660
>> I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE
FORGET, TRUMP LOST VIRGINIA.

130
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,459
SO DID ED GILLESPIE.

131
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:57,019
WHY WOULD HE TRY TO STICK
MORE TO YOUR POLICIES?

132
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:58,760
HE LOST VIRGINIA.

133
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,820
>>GOOD POINT.

134
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:06,839
LET'S GO TO LAURA INGRAM
AGREEING WITH DONALD TRUMP.

135
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,259
>>GILLESPIE

136
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:12,370
NEVER JUMPED ON BOARD THE TRUMP
TRAIN, HE IS AN OLD BUSH HAND.

137
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:15,050
I THINK YOU GAVE IT
HIS BEST SHOT.

138
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,310
HE IS WHO HE IS, HE IS NOT A
POPULIST CONSERVATIVE.

139
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,309
A POPULIST CONSERVATIVE LIKE
TRUMP WHO HAS A STRONG

140
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:24,629
PERSONALITY AND STRONG
MESSAGE DID DO BETTER.

141
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:27,999
HE DIDN'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME
CAMPAIGNING IN VIRGINIA AND

142
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:34,810
ED GILLESPIE TRIED TO
DO THIS DANCE.

143
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,160
I THINK IN THE END THAT CAME OFF
AS DESPERATE AND WOULD'VE

144
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,660
HAD GILLESPIE HAD CAMPAIGNED ON
PRESERVING OUR HISTORY,

145
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,959
VIRGINIA FIRST, LAW AND ORDER.

146
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:48,959
SIMPLE.

147
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,279
>>ISN'T THAT WHAT HE DID?

148
00:09:51,279 --> 00:10:03,560
>>HE DID THAT, THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT HE DID.

149
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,699
STEVE BENNETT BASICALLY SAID
THE SAME THING, GILLESPIE

150
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:11,779
COULD'VE ONE.

151
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,850
STEVE BANNON BELIEVES THAT
SOMEONE OTHER THAN ANOTHER

152
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,089
PERSON DISAGREES WITH HIM.

153
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:37,579
A COUPLE DAYS AGO STEVE
BANNON SAID THIS.

154
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:40,480
SO 48 HOURS OR 72

155
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,439
HOURS AGO GILLESPIE WAS GOING TO
WIN BECAUSE HE EMBRACED TRUMP.

156
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:52,209
AS SOON AS HE LOSES, ACCORDING
TO STEVE BANNON, HE LOST.

157
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:57,190
BREITBART WENT WITH
THIS HEADLINE.

158
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,720
THIS IS AFTER BEING INCREDIBLY
SUPPORTIVE OF HIM BECAUSE

159
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,060
HE WAS A DOUCHE BAG.

160
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,649
>>THAT IS FUNNY.

161
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:08,660
>>THAT IS AN INTERESTING
INTERPRETATION.

162
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:19,720
STEVE BANNON IS AN FASCINATING
HUMAN BEING MADE OF PLAY-DO

163
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,589
AND GIN.

164
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:27,910
THE ESTABLISHMENT LOST IN
TRUMP'S ESTABLISHMENT NOW

165
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:32,269
AND THE UGLY FACES IS UNMASKED.

166
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:40,569
>> THEY TRIED TO PITCH HIM AS A
POPULIST, BUT HE IS NOT, HE
