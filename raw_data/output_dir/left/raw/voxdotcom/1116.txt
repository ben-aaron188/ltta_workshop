1
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,700
Venezuela was once the richest country in
Latin America.

2
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,809
It has the largest known oil reserves in the
world.

3
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,660
And its democratic government was once praised
world wide.

4
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,880
But today, Venezuela’s democratic institutions
and its economy are in shambles.

5
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,160
The country has the highest inflation in the
world, making food and medicine inaccessible

6
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,160
to most Venezuelans.

7
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,760
Over the last four years, its GDP has fallen
35%, which is a sharper drop than the one

8
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,500
seen during the Great Depression in the US.

9
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,020
The country’s murder rate has surpassed
that of the most dangerous cities in the world.

10
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,369
These conditions have sparked months of protests
against the president, Nicolas Maduro.

11
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:17,670
And it’s easy to see why: the country has
become measurably worse since his election

12
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,909
in 2013.

13
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:25,560
A poll showed that about 80% of Venezuelans
want Maduro removed from office.

14
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,819
But instead, the opposite has happened: Maduro
has consolidated his power bringing the country

15
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,280
closer to authoritarian rule.

16
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,180
Maduro’s political ambition became evident
in December 2015.

17
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,289
Two years after he became president, a coalition
of opposition parties called the Democratic

18
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:50,209
Unity Roundtable or MUD, won a two-thirds
majority in the National Assembly, putting

19
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:51,599
Maduro’s rule at risk.

20
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,569
In response, Maduro quickly forced out several
Supreme Court justices and filled the positions

21
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:58,390
with cronies loyal to him.

22
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,989
In March 2016, the court ruled to strip the
opposition-led National Assembly of its powers

23
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:06,009
-- a move that sparked massive protests across
the country.

24
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:10,169
The ruling was reversed a few days later,
but the damage was done -- protests continued

25
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,040
to grow and have left about 100 dead and thousands
injured so far.

26
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,590
Despite the violence and public outcry, Maduro
held a vote in July to elect a new governing

27
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,989
body called the National Constituent Assembly,
which would have the power to rewrite Venezuela’s

28
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:30,280
constitution and replace the National Assembly. And leave virtually non opposition to Maduro's rule.

29
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,530
With Maduro's recent vote, Venezuelans didn’t have
a say in whether the assembly should exist.

30
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,209
They only had the option to elect its members.

31
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:58,540
But when Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez
proposed a constitutional rewrite in 1999,

32
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,819
he first called for a referendum to propose
the election of the assembly.

33
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:08,080
After most Venezuelans voted yes, they elected
a new National Constituent Assembly.

34
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,540
See, unlike Maduro, Chavez was a charismatic
and beloved leader.

35
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,890
In the 90s, he burst onto television sets
across the country.

36
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,220
He blamed government corruption and Venezuela’s
elite for the economic inequality.

37
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,939
His populist message resonated with the country’s
poor who eventually helped bring him to power.

38
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:30,329
The key moment in his presidency came in 2004 when oil prices surged.

39
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:35,120
Venezuela’s petroleum- dependent economy started booming and Chavez went on to spend billions from the

40
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,810
profits on social-welfare programs for the poor.

41
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,510
He subsidized food, improved the educational
system, built an enviable healthcare system

42
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,950
and reduced poverty by more than half.

43
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,239
These programs certainly helped the poor, but they served a purpose for Chavez as well.

44
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,510
In order to be re-elected, he needed to keep
millions of poor Venezuelans happy.

45
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,459
So he rigged the economy to do just that...

46
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:59,880
He didn’t scale back Venezuela’s dependence
on oil and his unrestrained spending led to

47
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,330
a growing deficit.

48
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,260
Which meant all these programs would be impossible
to sustain if oil prices fell.

49
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,499
After Chavez’s death, when Maduro took office
as his handpicked successor, that’s exactly

50
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:14,430
what happened:
Oil prices plummeted in 2014 and Maduro failed

51
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,529
to adjust.

52
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:20,529
Hyperinflation has made medicines and food,
that was once subsidized, unaffordable for

53
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,280
Venezuela’s poor, who now make up about
82% of the population.

54
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:30,960
Like Chavez, Maduro has also rigged the economy
to keep himself in power, but this time it’s

55
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,889
not benefitting the poor.
He’s exploited a complex currency system,

56
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:36,270
put in place by Chavez.

57
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,650
Maduro’s set the official exchange rate
at 10 bolivars per US dollar.

58
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,500
But only his friends and allies have access
to this rate.

59
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,090
In reality, the venezuelan currency has become
basically worthless.

60
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,280
Most Venezuelans get their dollars on the
black market, where the rate is about 12,000

61
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,950
bolivar per dollar.

62
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,910
The military, which got complete control of
the food supply from Maduro in 2016, is reportedly

63
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,050
profiting off of this currency crisis.

64
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,831
They import food at Maduro’s special currency
rate and sell it on the black market for a

65
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:06,580
massive profit.

66
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,770
So military generals and political allies,
crisis has offered a lucrative opportunity

67
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,760
which has helped Maduro stay in power.

68
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,080
But he can’t rely on that support alone...

69
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,680
...which brings us back to Maduro’s recent
power grab.

70
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,410
The opposition boycotted the vote, but Maduro
held the vote for the new constitutional assembly

71
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,140
anyway, and won a majority.

72
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,820
"Protests on the streets of Venezuela turned deadly after President Nicolas Maduro

73
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,520
declares victory.

74
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
The violence on Sunday very real

75
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,520
The bomb went off near some motorcycle police wounding several.

76
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,680
Election day clashes between protesters claiming at least 10 more lives.

77
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,720
At least one candidate has been murdered, shot to death.

78
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,220
Maduro's government is trying to create the illusion of public support.

79
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,080
Thegovernment claimed about 8 million people,
or 40% of the country, voted.

80
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,140
But experts put that number much lower, at
just 3 million people.

81
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,280
The international community including Peru,
Canada, Spain, Mexico and Argentina condemned

82
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,280
the election.

83
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,080
The US imposed financial sanctions on Maduro
and members of his government.

84
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,930
But Maduro’s assembly, filled with loyalists,
convened anyway and it swiftly removed attorney

85
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,360
general Luisa Ortega, leader of the opposition.

86
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,300
Armed groups reportedly arrested several other
opposition leaders too.

87
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,530
Whether the group will rewrite the constitution
or postpone the next presidential election

88
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:58,530
remains to be seen.

89
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:03,320
For now, Maduro has unprecedented power over
a country that continues to spiral out of

90
00:07:03,320 --> 00:00:00,000
control.
