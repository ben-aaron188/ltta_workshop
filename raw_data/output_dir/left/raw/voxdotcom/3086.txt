1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,440
Elon Musk thinks it's almost certain that we are living in a computer simulation.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,200
"There's a one in billions chance that this is base reality."

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,360
He says that humans are basically some advanced version of The Sims.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,840
Yes, that idea sounds pretty absurd.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:21,840
But we shouldn’t just write this off. People used to think the solar system worked like this. But almost 2000 years before Galileo proved it didn’t,

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,720
Aristarchus of Samos posited the exact same, crazy idea. Reality is probably not as it seems.

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,420
Musk is echoing a paper on this theory by philosopher Nick Bostrom. His argument goes like this...

8
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,580
“40 years ago we had Pong, like two rectangles and a dot.”

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,980
30 years after Pong, we got The Sims.

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:48,980
“Now 40 years later, we have photorealistic 3D simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and it’s getting better every year.”

11
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,940
So let's go about 10,000 years into the future

12
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:58,940
It’s possible that when we get there, civilization will be entirely gone because there is a ceiling to our advancement.

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,640
Maybe it’s because of global warming — or self-replicating robots.

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,660
“...if civilization stops advancing, that may be due to some calamitous event that erases civilization.”

15
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:15,660
But another possibility is that if we keep advancing — and assuming everything in the physical world CAN be simulated —

16
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,620
eventually, we’ll simulate ourselves.

17
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,420
Every synapse in entire human brain, for everyone on earth.

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
Getting enough computing power to run billions of ancestor simulations could be a problem.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,800
But Bostrom thinks we’d send tiny, self-replicating robots to other planets, which would turn the planet into a huge computer.

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,220
And some of the simulations would start making their own simulations.

21
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,920
In this scenario, there are billions of universes that are indistinguishable from our own.

22
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,320
That means, chances are, we are in one of the simulated universes.

23
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:58,780
And given the other possibility —  which is human civilization has an inevitable ceiling — Musk thinks we better HOPE that we’re in a simulation.

24
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:05,780
“Either we’re going to create simulations that are indistinguishable from reality, or civilization will to cease to exist. Those are the two options.”

25
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,980
There is one other —maybe future humans just don’t want to run ancestor simulations.

26
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:18,980
Maybe they think it’s unethical, because there is a tremendous amount of suffering in the world. And that suffering would still feel real to simulated humans.

27
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,100
Or maybe they have other priorities.

28
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:28,100
So to recap, there are three possibilities. 1. Humans go extinct before we’re able to run a simulation this big.

29
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,260
2.  Humans don’t run simulations because it’s wrong or boring.

30
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,060
Number three, we are living in a simulation.

31
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,020
Elon Musk thinks that there’s only a tiny chance we are in scenario 1 or 2 –

32
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,980
The philosopher Nick Bostrom thinks it’s more like a 20% chance that we’re in a simulation.

33
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,280
But if you’re not into futuristic predictions, Bostrom thinks the argument also provides other rewards.

34
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,440
He says, “It suggests naturalistic analogies to certain traditional religious conceptions.”

35
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,220
In other words, if we’re living in a simulation, there is a higher-level being — but it’s some version of us!

36
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,020
This leads to a rabbit hole of conversations, which is why Elon Musk has rules about when he can talk about this.

37
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,260
“It got to the point where every conversation was the A.I.-slash-simulation conversation and

38
00:03:16,260 --> 00:00:00,000
and my brother and I finally agreed we would ban such conversations if we were ever in a hot tub.”
