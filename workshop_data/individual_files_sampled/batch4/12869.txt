we begin with Jimmy Kimmel so Jimmy Kimmel trotted out his child again last night and I hate this more than I can tell you when people do this hey I can safely say because it has been scientifically verified that I have the two cutest children on planet earth in fact I have a child of three-and-a-half years a girl of three-and-a-half years old who is so cute that last night she actually started doing lines from the room and no I'm not kidding she is amazing but she also happened to have a heart condition she had an open heart surgery that was performed at the same hospital by the same doctor as Jimmy Kimmel son and yet I do not routinely trot out my daughter's story whenever I talk about healthcare what I'm talking about Obamacare policy I don't say and I know about this because my daughter had her chest cut open because they had to fix an ASD a hole in her heart I don't do that because it's stupid I don't do that because I don't think that there's virtue in victimhood I don't think that just because something bad happened to you in life that means that now you know more about that thing than anyone else I think that this this reference to personal experience when it comes to policy matters is actually the end of policy because the reality is it's it's very watered down form of identity politics the reality is that politics is based on the idea that I can talk about ideas and you can talk about ideas because we can sympathize with one another because we can think what it would be like to walk in one another's shoes without actually having walked in those shoes if talk about healthcare is restricted to only those who've used the healthcare system if talk about about about financial systems is restricted to only those who have worked in the financial system then pretty quickly we are going to come to the end of politics we can all have opinions on matters of public policy specifically because we have the capacity as independent human beings to think about what all of these things mean for us and for others right the way the politics is done is by shaping policy around what we would think it would be like to be another person we don't actually have to have experience that thing where you don't have to have actually experienced the Holocaust in order to think the Holocaust was bad you don't actually have to have experienced homophobia in order to think homophobia is bad you don't have to have experienced racism in order think that racism is bad right all of these things we can think about and come to moral conclusions about without actually having personally experienced them this is one of the I really dislike what Jimmy Kimmel does whenever he brings out his child to talk about health care policy so here's his unsuspecting kid is his unsuspecting kid had a second surgery last week I guess he has one more when he's age 6 and then he has done for life we can hope and pray so Kimmel brings out his kid to talk about the Children's Health Insurance Program so children's health insurance program is basically a supplemental health insurance program for kids who are poor and parents who cannot take care of those kids properly medically speaking it was sponsored originally by Orrin Hatch Republican from Utah in the Senate in 1997 Republicans have been continuously funding it ever since so have Democrats and now there's a bit of a hold up in terms of final funding for the chip program but that is not because Republicans are uncaring or unfeeling yet that is what Kimmel says so Kimmel brings out his kids to talk about chip what does this kid have to do with chip the answer is nothing or ask it has nothing to do with chip his kid is not on chip the fact is the Jimmy Kimmel is a very very wealthy man he has health insurance I am sure through ABC but Jimmy Kimmel brings out his child and he starts talking about chip because for some reason the experience of his child connects with with chip in some way but you don't have to show me a sick child in order for you to make the case for chip whether it's good public policy or bad public policy but that's just with Jimmy Kimmel done so here is Jimmy Kimmel jumping right in and talking about Hawaii his son surgery links up to healthcare policy for poor people who are not him or something chip is the Children's Health Insurance Program it covers around it comes around 9 million American kids whose parents make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but don't have access to coverage affordable coverage that are jobs which means it almost certainly covers children you know about one in eight children are covered only by chip and it's not controversial it's not a partisan thing fact the last time funding for chip was authorized was in 2015 it passed with a vote of 392 to 337 in the house and 92 to 8 in the Senate overwhelmingly Democrats and Republicans supported it until now now chip has become a bargaining chip it's on the back burner while they work out their new tax plans betweens parents of children with cancer and diabetes and heart problems are about to letters saying their coverage could be cut off next month Merry Christmas right oh those evil Republicans Merry Christmas on he talks about how tax cuts are the real problem with this right he says they let this money expire while they work on getting tax cut for their millionaire and billionaire donors so this is this is the shtick that Jimmy Kimmel is pushing right now by the way they so-called tax cuts for the millionaire and billionaire donors okay we talked yesterday about how the Senate botched the bill if you make over six hundred fifteen thousand dollars and you're self-employed and you have like a kid there's a good shot you're actually gonna pay more in taxes than you will make and money above a certain amount of money if you live in a high tax state like California or New Jersey but Jimmy Kimmel doesn't know he's talking about and this is the problem right everyone is sitting here and the visuals matter so you're sitting here and you are watching his very cute child and that is a very cute child right it's an adorable kid and you feel terrible for that adorable kid as well you should write I know I've been in this situation I know what it's like to have an adorable child who's had to be cut open I get it okay but what he is saying is pure nonsense here okay what he is saying is not factually correct okay the House passed legislation last month to fund chip for five more years Democrats opposed it Democrats opposed it on the grounds they didn't like its funding mechanism it passed the House anyway the Senate Finance Committee passed a version of that bill too they haven't figured out the offsets from funding it why do they need the offsets from funding it they need the offsets from funding it because in order for them to pass it through the Senate without it being filibustered you have to show that it's not going to add to the deficit okay so the Senate already is considering pushing it President Trump last week last week signed funding for chip that will take it all the way through the end of January 31st funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that federal agency has been signing checks to States for the last two months chip is not going unfunded senator hatch again the original sponsor of the chip program has pushed forward the Kids Act reauthorizing chip for another five years as well Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Sunday said quote we need to make sure the Children's Health Insurance Program which is expiring gets to panel before the end of the year sounds of people are wasting time on tax cuts these two issues are completely disconnected the tax cuts have nothing to do with chip nothing but Kimmel is trying to promote a narrative that isn't even true and he's using his son to do it which is just yucky okay it's just gross the fact is again tax cuts have nothing these are two completely separate legislative efforts and not only are they completely separate legislative efforts what's hilarious about this is the Kimmel is saying that the Republicans are trying to hold up chip because they're trying to help out their millionaire and billionaire friends they're taking money from kids like Jimmy Kimmel Sonic's captive Jimmy Kimmel's some rapport and they're trying to use that money to pay off all of these super wealthy people you know where the Republicans are trying to get the money to pay for chip you want order to try and get the money to pay for chip where the offsets are for high-income earners on Medicare in other words they're trying to get it from rich old people they're trying to take the money from rich old people and make sure that young sick kids can get it and Jimmy Kimmel is sitting there ripping on the Republicans for it now again the point of this is that optics and politics means everything optics and politics is the whole shebang and the fact that he's willing to use his child for opticals for optics like this I find it really distasteful I think it's bad for the country I think again that it drives us to a place in politics where we can't have conversations with one another because if I say if I didn't have a kid who had a condition would I be able to critique Jimmy Kimmel when people pay attention to it or if I were just another conservative commentator if I revoke Roe right who's not even particularly concerned about all things healthcare let's say Arabic and I don't know I don't think I because he has had a kid with a condition like this but let's say that you're a full on expert in healthcare this is what you did full-time right you worked over at Cato Institute or a Heritage Foundation and this is what you did full-time you don't have a sick kid we're not gonna pay as much attention to you as we do to Jimmy Kimmel because Jimmy Kimmel has a child who's who's playing with his thumb while he talks I hate this stuff more than I can tell you I think it's opportunistic I think Jimmy Kimmel is doing something morally bad here I think it is morally bad to use your child's condition as a as a lever in order to promote your favorite policies especially when your child's condition has nothing to do with those policies policy is about what's good for the bulk of the American people it is not about what sympathy level you can garner by bringing out a cute child or a cute puppy and to me these this argument is no different than if Nancy Pelosi would start stumping for Obamacare and she'd bring out a cute puppy and Stroke it while she was talking and then every so often reference the puppy again not because puppies and children are the same I'm violently against this notion right whenever people say that they have a dog and it's their four-legged child I just want to kind of kick them in the ass but what is it but is what is particularly ridiculous about this is again the Oshin that jimmy kimmel what he's saying is factually wrong but somehow it's given added credibility and if you look at the headlines today about Jimmy Kimmel I'm gonna tell you what some of the headlines say right on on various outlets so USA Today joined by his son Billy an emotional Jimmy Kimmel makes the case for chip TV line Jimmy Kimmel bring son to live for chip funding plate daily beats Jimmy Kimmel with son until delivery tear-filled tear-filled plea for health insurance Jimmy Kimmel and Billy blast Congress for holding chip hostage according to Deadline Jimmy Kimmel brings out his son to talk about health care at any point in here would somebody like to point out the fact that everything Jimmy Kimmel says about this thing is actually not true like would that be useful at any point do you actually talk about the facts of the situation are we just gonna be bamboozled by the fact that he's bringing out a cute kid again I can bring out cute kids too I'm not sure you'd make the show more visually interesting if I were to have my son and daughter on my knees while I did it I just don't think that it adds the political points I'm making very much and I think it would be a cheap political trick we have known for years that politicians kissing babies is a cheap political trick it is no less cheap when a late night host brings out his own baby in order to push a message that has nothing to do with reality
