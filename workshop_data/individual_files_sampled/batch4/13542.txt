but yesterday the President of the United States lived by the Kanye because Kanye West came to the White House now as I've said for many months at this point do I think that Kanye West is the world's best political commentator do I think that he's on par with you know the late Charles Krauthammer no I don't so I think that he knows a lot about politics I don't think that he's read tons of books but do I think that he has a unique perspective on the world that I do and so I think that he has every right to express that perspective just as anyone else would absolutely and do I appreciate more than anything that Kanye West has basically said look I am an individual I'm not just a black man who fits in your category I'm an individual with my own thoughts and experiences and feelings and that allows me to think outside the box with regard to my politics without you trying to Club me into place like a baby seal that I appreciate that I appreciate and when Kanye wears around the Maggie hat and he says that this basically is me just saying to the world I can think for myself that's a message that I like and appreciate and think is actually deeply important because even if it's coming from a guy who I don't think is world's most knowledgeable about politics that's not a message that requires you to be all that knowledgeable about politics saying I like to get more information I like to think for myself and I'm not going to be the person you think I ought to be simply based on the color of my skin deeply deeply important message from Kanye West so Kanye has been what's funny is all the people on the Left were very upset at Kanye like oh well what's Kanye actually doing except chilling for Trump Kim Kardashian got a woman freed from prison okay what have you done lately yeah I didn't even agree with Trump's decision on that on Alice Marie Johnson who was leading a drug ring it turns out but she was pardoned by President Trump because Kanye West and Kim Kardashian lobbied it is that simple and Kanye West has been pushing hard for criminal justice reform so as Kim Kardashian and president Trump is about to overrule Jeff Sessions on criminal justice reform in the same way largely because of Kanye's lobbying so Kanye by extending a hand actually received a hand in return which is why you saw that meme from predator going there a of the of the Arnold Schwarzenegger arm and the Apollo Creed arm you know the Carl Weathers arm locked in the in the muscle II embrace that's what you saw yesterday at the White House so it was wild I mean let's not pretend that this was a meeting of brilliant minds on serious issues it was Kanye West and Donald Trump in the Oval Office and it seemed directly out of idiocracy but was it important for the culture that there be somebody in a prominent position to say yeah I'm allowed to think for myself yeah that's that's important stuff so anyway Kanye goes to the White House and again I don't like celebrity politics but this is the world we have chosen this is where we live i I hate celebrity politics when it was Obama I used to mock the crap out of him for this sort of stuff I hated it when it was Hillary Clinton used to mock her incessantly for this sort of stuff I don't like it from Republicans either but and so when I say I don't like celebrities in the Oval Office and I don't like the meeting with the president and I don't like all of the pomp and circumstance and show and all that believe me I don't but since this is the world we have chosen and the world we have chosen to live in it is hypocritical for folks on the Left to suggest great when Obama does it terrible when Trump does anyway Kanye shows up at the White House and things got wild things got really wild because it turns out that Kanye is a wild dude so here he is in the Oval Office wearing his Magga hat and the press are just eating this stuff up the press the very serious press who say no we must treat the president with the presidency in the Oval Office with all sorts of respect there they're eating this up they love it they couldn't love anything more so here was Kanye yesterday saying that Trump did not expect a crazy mofo like Kanye fair enough here he is Trump is on his hero's journey right now and he might have expected to have a crazy mother like Kanye West run up and support but best believe we are going to make America great okay so the the press went nuts over this particular comment for a couple of reasons one saying that Trump was on a hero's journey which is pretty joseph campbell and second him dropping mofo on TV in the Oval Office so Jim Acosta tweeted this out Jim Acosta tweeted out Kanye just said mother-effer in the Oval Office / White House pool and people like ovule cage him is he gonna be okay Jim and because that's ridiculous like not to put too fine a point on it but Bill Clinton got blowjobs in the Oval Office so I'm really not gonna go if we're gonna talk about things that disgrace the Oval Office like cigars have had human bodily fluids on them that didn't come from the oral cavity in the Oval Office like they had to steam clean all the carpets after Bill Clinton left it and and there's there's a book fully describing Rahm Emanuel dropping the MF bomb repeatedly in the Oval Office so no Jim Acosta I love Jim Acosta getting all hot and bothered about all of this i clutching his pearls it's just it's amazing it's just amazing so Jim Acosta anyway so Kanye says all of that and then Kanye goes on and he says you know what I love my Maggie hat now we know he loves his Maggie hat because he said this before he was on SNL and he said my Maggie hat is just the best thing ever which I got to admit it's pretty fantastic the Kanye wears a Maggie hat it is because just the the juxtaposition of Kanye who is I have been told by the Utes one of the cooler people in America wearing the Maggie hat and let's be straight about Magga hats just as a general rule just aesthetically there's something that my family wore at like the Shapiro family picnics in 1996 that you got from like the mass production store that had like you remember they had like a little woven band that goes just above the brim of the cap so Kanye wearing that as sort of a an ironic feel is just spectacular so here's Kanye talking about why Maggie hats are awesome and you got to appreciate it man you just you can do one of two things you can either cry at the tragedy that this is what our national politics has become or you can laugh at the fact that Donald Trump is now swiveling every pop culture meme the left ever created back on them and slapping them in the face with it which is just hilarious and maybe feel like Superman you made a Superman house that's my favorite superhero and you make a Superman cape for me also as a guy that looks up to you the wrap-around list up to American industry guys non-political no bull put the beep on it however you want to do it five seconds to delay and just goes in and gets it done yes okay so first of all learning a couple of things net clip one Superman is Kanye's favorite superhero which is good I mean that's a good pick I'd go at Batman myself but Kanye's got his own taste man and then we also learned that de magie hat is like a Superman cape which is just spectacular you could see the media members in the room collapsing in on themselves like dying stars it's just great and then Kanye does the worst thing in the world he gets up and he says about President Trump I love this guy now what's hilarious about this is that until Donald Trump ran for president this was the view of Hollywood Donald Trump was very popular with all of these people in the media he was very popular he was very popular in Hollywood like he'd go around and however people would be back slapping him giving him hugs he was doing cameos on every show so it's kind of funny now that oh my god Kanye gave him a hug everybody loved Donald Trump until the guy ran for president in 2016 at which point everybody hated Donald Trump but here was Kanye breaking the ultimate taboo and making physical contact in the flesh with Donald J Trump there it is there's the curl weathers Arnold Schwarzenegger hand grip just amazing stuff and then Kanye actually had some pretty good political comments so we'll do the good and then we'll get to you know the weird so he so he had some good political comments about racism what he said is basically you can't use racism as an excuse for failing in America anymore instead maybe we ought to think about how we actually better the country seems pretty fair to me and this is coming from a guy who as I understand it grew up with a single mom in an impoverished area and then made himself a billionaire so even though I don't like rap and I'm not a fan of Kanye's music his story is a pretty American story it's a pretty amazing American story here's Konya talking about racism a lot of times it's just the overall lack of reparations that we any given point we say oh this is races this is race if this is race this is racist the liberal would try to control a black person the concept of racism because they know that we are very proud of emotional people so when I said I like Trump to like someone that's liberal they'll say oh but these races you think races okay control me don't stop me that's an invisible wall yes yep slow clap for Kanye and this is the point right the point that he's actually making here does not require you to be all that learned in politics and when he says that racism is very often used by political actors in order to achieve a particular result in order to manipulate people that is certainly true that is certainly true so well done Kanye there and then Kanye made everyone's head explode when he defended the Second Amendment which is just badass here's Kanye doing that debate about the Second Amendment going on the problem is illegal guns illegal guns is the problem not not legal guns we have the right to bear arms oh no all of there has just exploded Kanye actually saying the truth constitutionally about the Second Amendment now listen as I say before anytime you get in bed with celebrity you should expect that somebody's gonna get screwed and the fact is that something could happen with Kanye as a personality that could be damaging to all of the points that he's making here but take it at face value for what it is today he is saying some things that need to be said and when you hear an argument you really instead of first considering the source you may first want to consider the validity of the argument the argument that Kanye is making there is exactly right now as I say live by the Kanye die by the Kanye now I'll explain in a second how they die by the Kanye half of this work and then we'll get to the media coverage which is the real story the media coverage of this meeting is a much bigger story than Kanye actually visiting the White House he's been to the White House before I believe I mean he went there when Obama was president actually so it's not a giant shock but we'll talk in a second about the media coverage first let's talk about how you make your business more efficient one way that you can make your business more efficient is by putting it on legally solid footing you know the same time is money it is true especially when you run your own business but legal takes a lot of time and it takes a lot of money which is why you need to turn to Legal Zoom over the last 17 years more than a million Americans have used Legal Zoom to help launch their businesses but that is only the beginning Legal Zoom also now has a network of independent attorneys and tax professionals they can provide you the advice you need to get through the daily grind of running your business and the best part is you don't have to worry about driving to anyone's office or being billed by the hour because LegalZoom isn't actually a law firm you can count on Legal Zoom to provide the business resources you need and service that fits in your schedule listen I've been using Legal Zoom since long before they had this attorney services now they have this network of independent attorneys that broadens the scope of the services they can provide it is just great because you can I promise you can spend a fortune on legal if you can avoid that by going to Legal Zoom you should totally do it go to Legal Zoom calm right now and use promo code been at checkout for special savings again that's promo code been at legalzoom.com Legal Zoom where life meets legal go check it out legalzoom.com okay so as I say there's good Kanye and then there's bad Kanye so it's great when people make good arguments it's not as good when they juxtapose them with crazy talk so I do have to point out that Kanye did engage in some very Kanye behavior Kanye took out his phone and he proceeded to punch in his code which as it turns out is zero zero zero zero and then it was funny people were getting uptight about this because how can you reveal Kanye's code on his phone do you have Kanye's phone you know do you so does it matter unless he loses his phone is that going to matter at all but I will say that Kanye needs better code protection on his phone that's it mr. West I would appreciate it if you used some other number other than zero zero zero in any case he types in zero zero zero zero and then he proceeds to show the President of the United States a picture of a hydrogen powered airplane and this is a thing that happened because I don't know I don't know man we all hit our head on the toilet and now we invented the flux capacitor or something so here is Kanye showing showing President Trump a hydrogen powered airplane this right here is the I plain one there's a hydrogen power airplane and this is what our president should be flying in look at this year you know like that well we're gonna have Apple American company work on this plain wood this is our president he has to be the freshest the playas the flyest Plains the best factory okay so it all comes as a package man there is no separating this out the same guy who's saying some good stuff about politics is also talking about hydrogen-powered I planes so that is the thing I will say just as as an observer it was really funny to watch a president Trump during this meeting because President Trump is rarely blown out of a room by somebody else is sort of wackiness and charisma usually it's Trump blowing somebody else out of the room with that sort of stuff him sitting across from Kanye and looking at the look on president Trump's face it's kind of like the look that Jeb Bush has on his face when he's in a room with President Trump cuz they Trump suddenly realized what it was like to be Jeb Bush and watch this guy who's a much bigger celebrity just jabbering at him and not knowing quite what to do it was really funny so you have to appreciate the humor in all this and also is it a big deal that Kanye visited the White House it would have been if we were if we were a serious country but we're not a serious country we're not okay Barack Obama was fine with having celebrities at the White House I will show you in just one second so the media came out how dare this happen how dare it know it's so bad it's so terrible so over on MSNBC the hosts over there Stephanie ruhle and Ali Velshi they just melted down they suggested that Kanye West was an insane person but they also suggested Stephanie ruhle goes this is an assault on the White House really again in that room Bill Clinton Monica Lewinsky knee pads in the room a her Stephanie ruhle saying it's an assault on the White House that Kanye West's presence has defiled the Oval Office here she has Wow okay I'm doing this for everybody who's watching us who turned their volume down you can put it back up again that but if you think you're going to get a soft will play by play and political analysis you're not because that was an assault on our White House we're not we're not we can analyze some of that stuff that was said as we warned you at the top there was a lit of profanity we there was actually more than you heard we were able to bleep some of it out but there was some of it didn't make it in there okay mom okay I love this school of arming there oh yeah it was just so terrible it's just so awful I mean I can't believe anything like that has ever happened at the White House flashback just a few years Snoop Dogg went to the White House you know the great intellectual Snoop Dogg he was the or snoop lion or whatever he calls himself these days whatever a variety of animal from Animal Kingdom he calls himself to follow Snoop okay so Snoop Dogg was at the White House and you know what he did at the White House here's Snoop Dogg talking about how he talked at the White House how he smoked up at the White House like smoked pot at the Y at don't worry kanye west's mere presence at the White House defiled it but Snoop Dogg went there when Obama was president and smoked pot at the White House and everyone in the media thought this was hilarious and did you and when you got high before the White House did you also then smoke it up a little bit in the bathroom when you read I was trying to get to UM saying ikg yes yes don't you and nobody and no and I met the butler you met the butler did you get him some songs yes and it was hilarious and funny and awesome oh my god it's a great Sun Bauman's president and then as soon as Obama's not president no is this Stern office mr. not this is an office where only great things have happened this office you know great presidents Teddy Roosevelt FDR they sat in this office mono Lewinsky melts in this office I keep coming back to that because again if you're talking about to filing the Oval Office there's a level beyond having Kanye West there okay so the media again ignoring the fact that Barack Obama was ever-present I love this oh my god how could Trump hobnob with celebrities how could he have Kid Rock to the White House here is a picture of jay-z and Beyonce in the Situation Room okay with jay-z who wears a what is the 5% medallion which is like a quasi black power medallion at basketball games their pictures been doing that it's really kind of crazy stuff there he is sitting in the Situation Room in the White House Situation Room a company by the on say and this was just all fun and games it was just fun and games because come on man jay-z and Beyonce they're great can't go after queen bee come on this is all fun when it was Obama then it was then it was Kanye going to the White House and it was just terrible and then you remember this remember common going to the White House no do you remember common is a rapper who has in the past cut songs in favor of Assata Shakur an actual terrorist an actual terrorist well there he was in the White House but don't worry it's it didn't defile the White House in any way to have these folks who you know common who's rapped about supporting terrorism in the White House but Kanye was there and Kanye said nice things in orem Agra hat that was what was really bad here is common during the Obama administration it's an honor to be here in the White House library the tiny desk concert series has tried to give voice to people who have something to say in our culture who move our culture forward and do amazing stuff and in that spirit NPR Music presents Commons thank you oh yeah then again this was a White House Obama's White House you want to talk about this is the dirty little secret about Obama Obama was just much more celebrity-driven than Donald Trump everybody says oh he's a celebrity president Trump Obama was the first celebrity president he had no credentials when he became president he turned the White House into basically a revolving door of celebrities he used to kick remember during Benghazi he did a fundraiser in Las Vegas with jay-z and Beyonce so if you want to talk about celebrity in the White House you got to start with Barack Obama he was the guy who really turned the White House he the guy did interviews with glozell glozell like the lady who bathed in a bathtub full of Froot Loops come on come on okay so in just one second when you get into the media reaction to all of this which does show you how racist and terrible the media are it really is the reaction this is astonishing astonishing but first let's talk

response to Kanye as I mentioned before first of all there was their shock and horror that Kanye would even be in the how dare he men we get to the actual racism so a bunch of Democrats are just racists they're just racists they think that the color of Kanye's skin should dictate his political viewpoint that is racism now I've said in the past that when there are people who say I am Jewish and I believe in abortion for example I've said that's not a Jewish principle you know why cuz Judaism isn't an ethnicity only it's a religion it's an actual set of principles it's like saying that if you're pro-abortion and you say that you're Christian that's really difficult to say because Christian is a set of principles black is not a set of principles white is not a set of principles Asian is not a set of principles it's an ethnicity it's a skin color it's a race okay none of those should dictate anything having to do with what goes on inside your head obviously because if we thought that it did that would be textbook racism but the left likes to engage in textbook racism it's their favorite thing so we begin with Donna Brazile donna Brazile you'll recall was the briefly the head of the DNC before it was learned that she had been allegedly leaking questions in the debates to Hillary Clinton to help her defeat Bernie Sanders when she was working over at CNN here is what she tweeted out hashtag Kanye West has set us back a hundred and fifty five years wish says juror truth could have met him outside the White House and Frederick Douglass inside the Oval Office Barack Obama never would have become president with this crap but let's meet Kanye on election day by voting for Democrat so let's do the dating here Kanye West has set us back 155 years well it's 2018 no subtract 155 and you were talking about 1863 when slavery was still present so let me get this straight and uber wealthy black guy like a billionaire black guy goes to the White House to meet with the president hugs the president and gets the president to embrace criminal justice reform that he is pushing specifically because he thinks too many black men are in prison and that's the same as slavery according to Donna Brazile that's the same as slavery according to Donna Brazile oh okay sure why not okay that was not even the worst can that was just the beginning then there was then there was the CNN contributors who decided to mock Kanye as a token Negro who was illiterate because there's nothing that says I'm not racist quite like calling a black man who thinks differently a token ego who's a Negro who's illiterate nothing quite like saying that just astonishing here's two separate two separate Democrats on CNN saying this one of them is Bakari sellers and the other is Tara Seth Meyer and it's just it's just bad stuff kanye west is what happens when Negroes don't read and and we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it and pervert it and he's gonna have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures okay that's objective news anchors on lemon laughing as Bakari sellers says that that Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read ok well imagine if anybody had said that about like how many books does jay-z read or Beyonce so I think that they are the the great learned of Western civilization I mean I don't know I doubt it but does that matter they're allowed to have their own perspective this idea that Kanye West is illiterate because he disagrees with you is basically racist it's essentially racist but my car resellers can get away with it because he's a black man so it's okay because Bakari is black and Kanye is black he can call Kanye West a token Negro who is essentially illiterate and doesn't read books as opposed to actually engaging with his argument that wasn't the worst either then April Ryan shows up so April Ryan is supposedly a reporter she's actually mostly an activist and chews on CNN and she brought up a guy named Ray J now for those of you who are not culturally fluent Ray J is most famous for having done a sex tape with Kim Kardashian who is currently Kanye West's wife so Kanye West is married to Kim Kardashian Kim Kardashian rose to prominence off the on the back no pun intended of the Ray J sex tape April Ryan went for comment on the Kanye visit to the White House to the guy who stripped Kanye's wife on tape before she knew Kanye all-class these members of the media just all class here's April Ryan Zoo in that routine text messaging with Ray J you know who Ray J is he's he was once close with Kim Kardashian he said I think that it's great a great opportunity for young black entrepreneurs and artists to talk one-on-one with the President of the United States of America and he goes on to say this but and watching the tank from CNN he did say he's a little concerned there is a concern right now okay reaching out to the ex-lover of a guy's wife for comment is just I mean is it that is not even beyond the bounds of journalistic ethics that's too beyond the bounds of ethics period it's just beyond ethics heads it's crazy stuff that's crazy why in the world would you think that Ray J has anything unique to offer to the situation except that he once slept with Kim Kardashian on tape that's how is that even on CNN like how to CNN call itself a news network and do that sort of thing that's just garbage it's just garbage I think it's even worse than that so Don Lemon who is a disgrace to the name of objective journalism it's amazing like there are people who I think tried to be objective on CNN I said before I think Jake Tapper very often tries to be objective and tries to actually do his job Don Lemon has has forsaken all relationship with objectivity but still somehow calls himself an objective news reporter not an opinion journalist here is Don Lemon in invoking Kanye West dead mother to attack him his dead mother to attack him don't worry this is just journalism guys so much journalism so much reporting happening right here this was an embarrassment Kanye's mother is rolling over in her grave I spoke to one of her friends today or text it with one of her friends today from Chicago Dantas friends I used to live there I know him she said Donda would be what would be embarrassed by this is that an okay thing is that something that we're doing now we're allowed to Tek people's dead relatives these their dead relatives to attack them not their dead relatives in the sense that like their dead relatives did something wrong but in the sense they a dead relative who you didn't know and know nothing about and had a relationship with this man that she would be ashamed of him that she would be ashamed of Kanye West like that's this is sick I'm sorry this is just sick and the media is overwrought reaction to the fact that Kanye West shows up in the White House is indicative of a couple of different things one it is indicative of the fact that when a black person says they like President Trump the media hates no one like a black person who said they like President Trump no one because they have violated the tenants of intersectionality which suggests that we all think like our group we all think like our ethnic group so if you break away from that ethnic group or you break away from that sexual group right you're a gay person who likes Trump or you're a woman who likes Trump if you're any of those things then you are a traitor but we saw this with all the women who supported Brett Kavanaugh they were there were sex traders they just given in to the patriarchy they'd internalized The Handmaid's Tale and now we see this with Kanye West he's a black guy who's really white on the inside he's an oreo right I'm these black on the outside but white on the inside he's in the sunken place as people are now saying right this is it that sort of stuff he's deeply racist but that's why the left is so upset with Kanye is because he breaks two of their rules one he's a black man who supports Trump not allowed to he's the celebrity who supports Trump also not allowed for people to understand how much Trump is hated in Hollywood you have to understand that in Hollywood if you even express a remotely right-wing opinion you will never work again never work again I've said this before I have celebrities who listen to the show their major a play I'm not talking a celebrity's I'm talking a plus celebrities who listen to this show and I've visited with some of them I've had lunch or breakfast people have come into this office one of quite famous and I always tell them do not mention that you have been here if you wish to work in this town because the bias in Hollywood is so extreme that it doesn't matter your size of celebrity if you say that even associated with me and I didn't vote for Trump in 2016 if you say that you associated with me just a mainstream conservative who's pretty reasonable then that is enough to lose you jobs right that actually happened out here with Mark Duplass who just got destroyed right mark Duplass the guy who directed wild wild country on Netflix and he's done a bunch of other he's on the mini project he's done a bunch of other stuff he came in here because he wanted to get a pro-gun opinion from somebody for his new movie and so he came in and I gave him like an hour and a half and I said him don't tell anyone you've been here because if you do it will blow back on you and then he foolishly went on Twitter and said I was a nice guy and it ended his world he was attacked so harshly on Twitter he deleted the tweet and then put up a tweet apologizing for ever having tweeted that I was a nice guy right apologizing for that that's how it works in Hollywood so Konya he's broken two rules he's a black man and he's extraordinarily famous and if you are a black extraordinarily famous person you are not allowed to be Pro Trump and you are not allowed to be concerned of it anyway you have to toe the liberal line you wonder why to send his great shock and dismay taylor swift came out and embraced the democratic party because if you do not embrace the democratic party and you are a celebrity they will tear you down you know we on the right joke for a long time about the fact that that taylor swift did not send anything politically because the left kept calling on her to say something politically well eventually she did because she finally was pressured into it well we'll talk a little bit more about this plus we will get to the mailbag in just a second but first let's talk about your imminent doom we're all going to die we know it okay it's going to happen sooner or later I hope later for you but no matter when it happens you want to make sure that your family is taken care of and they are not left begging in the street your children orphaned like street urchins instead you ought to have some life insurance and the way that you get good life

to announce those as they come out we are the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation all righty so let's talk for one moment more about this celebrity stuff again Kanye broke two rules black man celebrity can't support president Trump if you are either of these the polls are showing that President Trump actually has a shot at breaking out of the five to ten percent box Republicans have been in in the black community for a long time and that's because as it turns out as I talked about yesterday minorities are not wedded to the woke social justice warrior version of politics that the Democratic Party wants to embrace Kanye is showing that right now and that is good because there is an important signaling element to the belief that it's okay to break out of the box that when you expand the Overton Window which is what Kanye is doing right now then people have the ability to think more freely more publicly that's quite a good thing and I think we should be grateful to Kanye for that even if we don't like the celebrity politics in which we are engaged and even if we think that all of this is quite stupid so we'll talk about that probably a little bit more next week and we'll talk about it on our Fox News election special that is coming up our final episode on Sunday at 8:00 but let's jump into the mailbag we haven't had like a good solid mailbag in a while so let's do it let's do a mailbag crystallin says hi Ben when you take your weekly and holiday Sabbath's and have to unplug I'm wondering whether you have a hard time letting go of the news are we able to forget about it and just focus on your family and activities or are you distracted and chomping at the bit to find out when what's going outside I don't have Sabbath but during the cabin on a Kavanagh debacle I had a hard time even shutting down to go to sleep have a meal or take a drive thanks for all you do well after years of doing it you sort of get used to the fact that you're not going to get the news and so you stop sort of chomping at the bit and there there's a radical shift in sort of the pace of life on Sabbath and on yom tov that the holidays i even though in the newspaper comes as somebody who's ensconced in internet news which is instantaneous print news is always you know 24 hours behind basically so i usually know everything that was in the newspaper on saturday already by friday afternoon but with all of that said i find it refreshing i mean it's nice though the worst thing is coming off of Sabbath right when you come off of Sabbath and you just get hit with the tsunami of news that is kind of difficult but I've gotten over I think the desire to it's actually a relief I actually get to do what I call my serious reading my non news based reading no philosophy or deep history where I get sort of my back knowledge from Vince has been what do you think is the best major city in America to live if weather is a factor thanks love the show well I mean if weather if weather is a factor then San Diego is the best city in America I mean San Diego's weather is just spectacular year-round it is just great all the time in terms of just great American cities you know I lived in Boston for three years aside from the weather it was fantastic but that's a big aside from because I went to Boston and I'd go in late August for the start of the school year and they suck are you because late August is beautiful in Boston late August in September just great and then it's October and from October to April it's just garbage it is just sleet and rain and snow and then you get like three weeks of niceness and the school year is over so you got like six weeks combined of things being great and the rest of it was just bad but Boston's a great historic city it's a lot of fun to be there when you can actually move around so I I did enjoy Boston Washington DC is fun to visit it's I like DC but only for short periods of time because I just can't take it anymore like they're just too many federal employees I can't handle it New York I am NOT a huge fan of as I have stated on the program that's because I grew up in suburbia and New York you can't see the sky so I actually start to get antsy if I can't see the sky if all I can see is a sliver of sky between tall buildings and I know New Yorkers have inordinate pride in in their city and they showed it's it's one of the great cities of the world it's just not a place that I think I would love to live I'm biased toward my hometown of Los Angeles all those kinda increasingly shabby because of Eric our city and the Democrats out here I mean it's it's it's really become a shabby town they they've done a horrible job of upkeep and that's been happening in leftist cities all around the United States Seattle used to be a beautiful city and then the mayoralty over there has just ruined the city of Seattle the same thing is happening in San Francisco which is a beautiful city but if you're just talking whether you're just talking about the San Diego is the place to be in fact there's a study that suggests suicide rates are higher in San Diego than other places in the United States specifically because the weather is good because people in other places in the country when they're having a bad day they're like yeah I know I'm depressed it's cuz the weather sucks in San Diego they look outside and like well I guess I'm depressed because my life is terrible because the weather is great Ryan says hey Ben during one of your young America's Foundation speeches a guy came up and asked you back position on abortion and said the same logic should be cause to become vegan or vegetarian could you please explain this to me being a religious man I believe God put animals on earth for our nourishment but I'm definitely interested to hear your take on this well first of all abortion and killing of animals not the same thing because human beings and animals not the same right as I'm a believer that human beings have capacities and rational capacities and in a religious sense souls that animals do not have so I don't feel the same way about killing of animals for food as I do about killing of humans for any reason so that is is not a good equivocal equivalence in the first place as far as the argument in favor of animal rights the fact is that a lot of animals are relatively sentient I mean they're they're pretty with it and for the same reason they wouldn't kill your dog and eat it there's not a terrible argument kilocalorie eat it now do we can you do it because human beings require animal proteins who survive I think for survival reasons and thriving reasons there's a good argument to be made that you should be able to eat meat and biblically speaking when people quote Genesis 9:3 which is the part where it says that anything on the earth you can basically eat when God says that to Noah which is actually in this week's Bible portion in the Jewish community it's important to recognize that this was after the expulsion from Eden and Eden the typical Jewish philosophy is that you couldn't eat animals that everybody was sort of a vegetarian and in Eden which doesn't sound that that great honestly I mean hamburgers are delicious but I've said before that in a hundred years people may look back and say how could people eat so many animals and I think that that may be true that said we'd have to come up with some pretty good substitutes for animal protein better than the ones that we have now for widespread vegetarianism or veganism to take place for human rights rather for animal rights reasons Lee says dear mr. Shapiro recently I've gotten in discussions about the rich paying their fair share of taxes some of my family who are Democrats are pretty wealthy and they feel they're not taxed enough compared to everyone else well then they can sign a check go for it it's all are you gang I don't know you get to stick your hand in my pocket because you feel you're not giving enough I give a fair bit of charity and the arguments they use in discussion are the loopholes for the rich and that the trickle-down effect doesn't work okay there are no loopholes for the rich all the tax breaks exist for everyone it's just that you only get to exercise certain tax breaks in certain areas there are people who get the Earned Income Tax Credit I do not receive the Earned Income Tax Credit because I make too much money most people in the United States make too much money to receive significant amounts of money back for the Earned Income Tax Credit that's a loophole for people who are not as wealthy okay so that's not a loophole that's just the way the tax system is structured when people say loopholes they act like well if I pay my lawyer a little more then he can find a loophole in the law that's not how it works that's not what a loophole is okay I don't believe in tax loopholes I believe we should play pay everybody should pay a fat a flat tax rate or we should have a national sales tax but there's no such thing as a quote unquote loophole that only applies to rich people it's just there are different types of income like capital gains versus traditional income and we can discuss whether those are good policy or bad policy but the language of loopholes is inaccurate how about the trickle-down effect does it work well the trickle-down effect is a term that is coined by leftist economists no one on the right has ever suggested that there's something called trickle-down where you give money to rich people and rich people suddenly make everybody else wealthy the idea is supply-side economics meaning that people who develop new and better products drive the economy that the economy is not driven by just handing out money to people who buy things the economy is driven by entrepreneurs who create new and better products and that creates its own demand so nobody knew there was a demand for cars until cars were mass-produced and suddenly everyone knew there was a demand for cars nobody knew like in 1950 there was no demand for iPhones now there's a high demand for iPhones because entrepreneurs created new and better products and that made your life better I talked about this a little bit earlier this week the why that wage stagnation since 1979 means that the quality of living since 1979 is stagnant is just idiotic and ignorant we live far better than we did in 1979 without any doubt whatsoever and that's because supply-side economics works ronald reagan's supply side economic theory led to the greatest peacetime growth in the history of the nation economically speaking so let's see Justin says do you think the left is successful in driving independent voters into the Wrights corner and if so is this dangerous as they won't question the right for fear of the left hash tag party tribalism yeah I mean I think that you should join the party with which you agree you shouldn't join a party simply out of opposition for another party so if I'm an independent and I don't like the Republicans cuz I think whatever and I don't like the Democrats cuz they're crazy that doesn't necessarily mean that you should love the Republicans you can vote based on which one you think is the lesser of evils it's not an argument I love but it's an argument you can make but I don't think that you should simply embrace a position because it's the opposite of another position that you don't like I think reactionary politics is bad on all sides and that's true right and left Luke says hey Ben any music or film celebrity you'd be interested in having on a Sunday special well yeah I mean they're there a bunch of them but none of them would would come on like I I would be very interested in having on Tom Hanks I'd be interesting having on tencel Washington I'd be interested in having on Christopher Nolan whose work I love yeah they're there a lot of film and TV celebrities mostly writers and directors I think that I'd be interested in having on the actors I don't find quite as interesting as a general rule but that's just because I've lived in Hollywood my whole life and most actors are reading lines written for them they're not the actual creators of the material but yeah I'd love to have all these people on but the problem is they think that they will lose work if they come on my show it is that simple Veronica says what's the best way to counter the left's gaslighting they accuse us of what they themselves are doing in our masters of revisionist history even regards to their own comments how do we fight it well the Internet has provided a pretty good outlet for this half of Twitter is taken up with the left says something like oh my god somebody said mf'er in the Oval Office like Jim Acosta and then the right saying dude worse things have happened in the Oval Office the left can only get away with this so long as there is no venue for a countervailing attack that venue now exists Courtney says dear supreme overlord Schapiro I was just recently hired for my first career job as a seventh grade world history teacher my question is do you think that educators in the classroom should be politically neutral acting more like a moderator in discussions about political views or is it okay for an educator to state their point of view and controversial topics thank you so much for doing the show I'm really a big fan well I I'm no I don't object to either one I think that if the educator can do their best to present both sides of a topic that's great if the educator can't do that then saying look here's my opinion so take it with a grain of salt and then here's a bunch of literature that counters my opinion and you make up your own mind that's probably the most honest way to do it because everybody has their biases and stating your bias he's upfront I think is probably a wise idea if the school allows you to do so Charlie says happy Friday it was a five six Christian southern conservative educated white male who apparently loses with privilege I appreciate everything new and the good folks associated with your company this said do you ever see the mentally ill genie of the Atlantis left going back into the bottle or do you see things getting worse with no one to cite also what do you think is damaged more beyond repair the social landscape of our country or the damage the new Star Wars movies did to the Star Wars universe thanks well the social landscape of our country I think is more damaged than Star Wars because I think that people have a unique capacity to buy into reboots so if they decided in five years to reboot the entire Star Wars universe we would all pretend as we should like the force awakens and last Jedi never happened and maybe even the prequels and then we'd all be fine right we do this every so often with superhero movies how many times would they rebooted Batman at this point a bunch so I think that we will all get along fine with a reboot in Star Wars land although they just resigned Kathleen Kennedy they just resigned Kathleen Kennedy but the you know the the question of our social fabric being damaged beyond repair I'm obviously deeply worried about that that's what my entire new book is about Valentino says why is Batman your favorite superhero when his only superpower is the plot well his only superpower is being extraordinarily rich and being extraordinarily smart now I ask you why is Batman my favorite superhero because Batman is the most shaded of all the superheroes right Batman has a dark side Batman's kind of an antihero um I also am I have to say I'm a fan of Frank Miller's Batman so Frank Miller did a comic that nobody appreciates except me called Batman and Robin All Stars in which Batman is basically a sadist who enjoys his job and I have to say that I enjoy that version of Batman because the version of Batman one who's always conflicted and sad about what he's doing maybe he just kind of likes going after bad guys like I kind of like that's what I liked about Batman V Superman is that Batman in that film was great Superman was a problem because he wasn't charming but Batman in that film forget about Ben Affleck the character was drawn like Frank Miller would meaning that it was hardcore I enjoy branding criminals and hurting them and I don't mind killing people like okay I'm with you that's fine right remember Batman doesn't live in a world where jailing people is actually an option that's why Batman never makes sense in the context of Gotham City because Batman in Gotham City all he does is jail people in Arkham and then they immediately escape and killed 10,000 innocent people well at that point you got to kill the criminal right if they can't hold the guy you have to kill him cuz otherwise if you don't kill him you're sending back to jail he escapes again you come back to jellies it means what happened to the Joker every five minutes and that's why wouldn't Batman's like I can't kill the Joker it's like no you should totally kill the Joker dude like you really should if it were a sama bin Laden and you were putting him in Gitmo and then every five minutes who's escaping and committing a terror attack at a certain point you put two in his face hey Joel says is the Democratic Party in a state beyond recovery due to its embrace of socialism and raucous behavior should be able to throw the Dems in the waste bin of history with the Whig party well I mean as they currently stay current least and sure I would prefer a democratic party that was not insane pressing actual solutions that maybe I disagree with so we can have an honest debate about the issues I think that a two-party healthy system is worthwhile and I think that right now we have a sick party in the Republican Party in a dying party in the Democratic Party at least in terms of ideology and the problem is that there are a lot of people who believe in that ideology okay a couple more see Sean says hi Ben I believe wholeheartedly in free market capitalism I've been a follower of Milton Friedman and Thomas old for years I believe that type B discrimination should be allowed in the private market as competition naturally disinclined business practicing unethical discrimination type B discrimination I've talked about on the show type a discrimination is you're black I won't hire you type B discrimination is I don't have any information about you and I'm banned by the federal government from having any information about your criminal history and a person from a group that has more criminal background just statistically comes into my office how do I assess that so of calls that type B discrimination because it really isn't your black I won't hire you it's I have to use the statistics available to me and the statistics happen to cut against your group so that's what he's talking about he says type B discrimination just to define it as my question is where should the line be drawn or sure the line be drawn by the judicial system in cases of fraud embezzlement theft or larceny is it morally consistent to oppose the anti-discrimination laws but not the specific cases of malpractice listed above well I think that it depends on the crimes so I guess the question is if you're talking about insider trading I am NOT a fan of insider trading laws I think insider trading laws are actually of no benefit to the to the public of the United States in fact if you want to make sure that there's more transparency then you should get rid of insider trading laws because you should just assume that if you work for a company you're going to have knowledge that you're going to trade on that knowledge and then the market is more responsive because we just watch what the executives of the company do at their stock they have to have professionals who watch what those executives do with their stock and if they're short selling their own stock you know the company's going to tank it creates faster-moving velocity in the economy as opposed to shielding the public from the information and then there is sort of three steps removed from the actual information Steve says dear Ben I recently started a new job in Corrections and received training on unconscious bias which I found to be a load of crap do you think unconscious bias is true no I think unconscious bias is indeed a load of crap there's very little evidence to suggest that the unconscious bias against particular groups manifests in behavior in fact the creators of the implicit assessment test actually say this I said this at USC and there is a guy who got up and he was asking questions about and he pointed to a study from 2007 suggesting the doctors who showed unconscious bias in studies were less likely to prescribe certain drugs to black people and he actually looked up the study because I want to know the evidence what the study actually found is that that was true but the people who are prescribing the drugs less often to black people were prescribing at parity levels with white people meaning that if you were not unconsciously biased you were over prescribing drugs to black people that's at that study actually found so it didn't actually show bias in action so unconscious biases is one of the least it's one of the least supported scientific theories out there it's really bad science and the implicit assessment tests are not duplicate bull meaning you can take them twice and get different results and they are not verifiable in the real world meaning that they are not always connected with behavior okay you know what let's let's just skip the thing I like today because we don't have time let's go to things that I hate okay so the view I still want to be under show that's like come on just do it already come on this is this is one of my aspirations in life is to be on the view but I criticize them frequently so I say I guess I get it I guess I got it guys okay in any case the view went after a Melania Trump why well because she's Melania Trump and her last name is Trump and she's married to Trump so they went after her because they said that she is willfully ignorant right this is the same spiel they give about Ivanka she is complicit okay but I'm complicit and what like the first lady is not an elected position what is she supposed to do first I've never understood this idea that we're supposed to care what the first lady thinks they really I don't understand like no one goes to my wife and asks her a political opinion because she's not in that profession she's a doctor okay but on the view on the view they started ripping into Melania because Melania supposedly wasn't reflecting their their ideas or something here's here's the view going after Melania Trump the First Lady of the United States telling women everywhere your word is not enough I think it does so much damage this is also the same woman that in the midst of what happens to Puerto Rico war jacket they said I really don't care do you so when she threw down that gauntlet I've decided not to care about anything she says from now on what she wears okay well I don't think you should have cared what she wore what she died in the first place like why would you I didn't care what Michelle Obama did or said except that when she was campaigning for Barack she's had some pretty bad stuff but I don't really care what she has to say now like I didn't care what Hillary Clinton said when she was first lady I'm happy when they say good things because I'm happy when anybody says good things but am I gonna get like really exercised about the First Lady of the United States not really she wasn't elected nobody put her in that position hey this is why it was so bizarre that Hillary ran for Senate after being the wife of the president it's so it's so weird to me that is a pure case of non feminism is just riding coattails obviously obviously think of a man like John Kerry were to marry up for money like John Kerry and then use that money to get elected to the Senate like John Kerry and then get married to a richer woman like John Kerry and then run for the presidency like John Kerry then I might say that he wrote a woman's coattails to high office but again the attacks on Melania are just silly and inappropriate and stupid all right well we will be back here on Monday but but Fox
